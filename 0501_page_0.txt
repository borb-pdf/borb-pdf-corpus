                         How safe are they?
                            X-RAY DEPARTMENT
                         Thirty years ago, X-rays were the only way
                            to see what was going on inside your body.
                         Now other methods of medical imaging are
                         available, some using different types of
                         radiation from X-rays. They are briefly described
                         on the next two pages. Patients are sometimes
                         concerned about the possible harmful effects
                         of radiation, so this leaflet goes on to explain
                         the risks and to put them into perspective.
