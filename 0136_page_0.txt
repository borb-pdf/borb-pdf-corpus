         WHO CAN BE MARRIED IN SCOTLAND? 
         
         Any two persons, regardless of sex or where they live, may marry in Scotland provided that: 
         
         Both persons are at least 16 years of age on the day of their marriage. 
         
         They are not related to one another in a way which would prevent their marrying (see the 
          list at Page 6 of this leaflet). 
         
         They are unmarried and not in a civil partnership*. 
         
         They are capable of understanding the nature of a marriage ceremony and of consenting to 
          marrying. 
         
         In the case of an opposite sex marriage, the marriage would be regarded as valid in the 
          party’s country of domicile. 
         
         * If you are in a qualifying civil partnership you can change it to a marriage – a qualifying civil 
          partnership is a civil partnership which was registered in Scotland, England, Wales 
          or Northern Ireland and has not been dissolved, annulled or ended by death or an overseas 
          relationship registered outwith the United Kingdom which is treated as a civil partnership in 
          Scotland and has not been dissolved, annulled or ended by death.
