      Introduction 
      This booklet gives some basic health and safety guidance as well as giving the local rules operating within the School. 
      This policy gives details of significant hazards in the workplace, the control measures implemented and monitoring 
      procedures carried out to check that these measures are effective. A list of those members of staff who provide safety 
      advice for particular hazards is provided on page 4. 
      The rules and guidance given in this booklet are derived from risk assessments carried out during regular School and 
      University safety audits, in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements. This booklet is kept under review and 
      updated as required. They form the “definitive version”. Printed copies of this document may be out-of-date. 
      The policies and guidance given here are to be considered as being in addition to the University Safety Policy and 
      Guidance Notes. They are also to comply with University local rules and all relevant legislation. 
      Relevant links to the Government’s Health and Safety Executive will appear throughout the policy. One particular source 
      of information that you may want to consult is the HSE leaflet on "Health and Safety Law - what you should know". 
      The University’s Environmental, Health & Safety Services web pages also have information you may find useful. 
      INDUCTION - Everyone in the School must read the on-line Health & Safety Induction and complete the quiz at the end 
      within 1 month of starting. There are two induction options – one for office based staff and one for everyone working 
      in a laboratory or a workshop etc. - the inductions can be found on the School web pages under Students & Staff, then 
      Safety at:  https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/safety/index.php , the inductions are at the bottom of the page under 
      ‘Other safety documents’. 
       
      Safety Policy statement 
      Matters of Health and Safety within the School are the responsibility of the Head of School. 
      There shall be a safety management structure for the school. There will be a School Safety Coordinator appointed by 
      the Head of School, delegated to deal with the day-to-day management of safety. There will also be specialists in specific 
      fields with delegated duties to advise the coordinator and the Head of School on their special area. See the list of school 
      safety duties for details. 
      There will be a School Safety Committee. This committee will meet at least twice a year and comprise representatives 
      of all categories of staff and students within the School. The Head of School will normally chair this committee. 
      The School Safety Committee shall determine and co-ordinate the safety policy for the School paying due regard to the 
      relevant governing legislation, the recommendation of the various University safety policies and committees and the 
      Safety Office. 
      The School will carry out a general risk assessment and endeavour to minimise risks to employees and students by acting 
      on appropriate legislation, providing training and adequate safety equipment, and encouraging safety consciousness 
      within the School. 
      The School shall endeavour to minimise risks to visitors, contract labour, and service engineers who may come into 
      contact with materials associated with the School both within the buildings and elsewhere. 
      The School shall keep appropriate records and risk assessments to comply with legislation. 
      Accidents and incidents will be reported to the Safety Office and thoroughly investigated by the School Safety personnel 
      or the University Safety Adviser. 
      The School shall carry out safety inspections at least once per year and at any time if required for current updating. The 
      inspection team will include the Safety Coordinator but may co-opt other specialist members, including the chairman. 
      Reports of these inspections will be made available to the Safety Office. 
      Signed by the Head of School: 
        
                    
       
      Professor Graham A Turnbull 
       
                                                      3 
               Emergency 
               In case of emergency dial 9-999 from any telephone. 
               Safety self-check 
               To help you do a self-audit before a building inspection is made, a checklist has been produced. The checklist is available 
               in Appendix A. 
               Since the checklist is for formative use, if you find you will be giving the wrong answer, then you should consider how 
               you could fix the problem, enabling you to give the right answer. This is much better than having an inspection team 
               demand you fix the problem before you can continue with any other work! 
               School Safety Duties 
               The Head of School has responsibility for safety in the School. The following list shows those members of the School 
               with delegated duties in particular areas of safety. These safety advisers must be consulted before designing any 
               experiment that may create a hazard.

                Fire 
                If you discover a fire you should follow the standard fire actions displayed on blue notices around the building. The text 
                of this notice is reproduced below. 
                Any disabled person who believes that they require assistance in the event of an emergency evacuation should contact 
                the School Safety Coordinator (Derek Milroy). 
                If you have left an experiment running that could be dangerous, meet the Fire Brigade and warn them. 
                The Fire Alarm is a continuous electronic siren. 
                The Fire Alarm is tested on a Monday at 14:00hrs when the alarm is activated for approx. 10 seconds. You should take 
                no action when this test is activated. 
                FIRE ACTION 
                Any person discovering a fire: 
                Sound the alarm by operating the nearest call point. If none, shout “FIRE!” 
                Call the fire brigade - Dial 9-999 (University Telephone System) or 999 
                         State precise location of fire. (Wait for confirmation of the message.) 
                         If safe to do so - attack the fire yourself with a suitable appliance. (Do not endanger yourself or others in doing 
                          so.) 
                On hearing the fire alarm: 
                         Leave the building by the nearest available exit. 
                         Close all doors behind you. 
                         Report to the person in charge at your assembly point:                
                          The car park in front of the main entrance (level 2). 
                Do Not: 
                         Take risks. 
                         Stop to collect personal belongings. 
                         Use any lifts. 
                         Re-enter the building until authorised by a Fire Brigade Officer. 
                Fire prevention 
                Storage of cardboard boxes, particularly those containing packing materials e.g. Styrofoam, is strongly discouraged. In 
                the event of a fire the cardboard provides excellent fuel, and the packing materials are a source of extremely toxic gas. 
                Medical Emergency 
                Follow the procedures given on the Medical Emergency notices around the building. The text is reproduced below for 
                completeness.

                Do not move the casualty, unless they are exposed to further danger. Do not risk injury to yourself while trying to help 
                the casualty. 
                                                                                                                                                  5 
                 Medical Emergencies Procedure 
                 If the condition requires further treatment either refer the casualty to the Community Hospital, Largo Road, St. Andrews 
                 (minor injuries) 
                 or if immediate medical attention is required telephone an ambulance on 9-999 (University extensions) or 999 call box 
                 Advise ambulance control of the location of the incident and of the type, seriousness and number of casualties involved. 
                 Accident reporting 
                 All accidents, unless obviously trivial, must be reported on the official University Accident Report form as soon as 
                 possible, and always within twelve hours, to enable fulfilment of statutory obligations. By law, major accidents (e.g. 
                 broken bones, electrical near-misses, etc.) and accidents causing the person to take seven or more days off work, must 
                 be reported by the University to the Health & Safety Executive. Reporting forms can be obtained from the University 
                 EHSS web page or the School Safety Coordinator. 
                 The online form should be completed, printed and then signed by the person concerned and the School Safety 
                 Coordinator. The form should then be sent to the Director of EHSS. One copy of this form should be kept by the injured 
                 person as their record, a second kept by the School as their record of the incident with the original copy sent to the 
                 Director of EHSS. An investigation to determine the cause of the accident will be carried out to comply with the legal 
                 requirements. 
                 All dangerous occurrences or “near miss” incidents should also be reported. These reports are used as part of the 
                 ongoing monitoring of Health & Safety around the University and can indicate areas where further safety action is 
                 required. 
                 Gas Escape or Toxic Spill 
                 The following procedure should be followed in case of any escape of gas (compressed gas, cryogenic spill, or “quench” 
                 of a superconducting magnet) or a major spillage of a hazardous substance: 
                      1.   Evacuate the room, or if considered necessary, the building. 
                      2.   Do not attempt a clean-up operation unless you are confident this can be carried out without risk to health. 
                      3.   If necessary, call the Fire Brigade: Dial 9-999, ask for the Fire Brigade and state:  
                           University of St. Andrews, School of Physics & Astronomy, North Haugh, Nearest Access and Your Name, 
                           (alternatively if at Observatory state Buchanan Gardens) 
                      4.   Meet the Fire Brigade, or delegate somebody who knows the exact location and nature of the accident. 
                      5.   Do not return to the room until it is declared safe by the senior fire officer present. 
                 Consultation with Employees 
                 The  University  has  issued  the  following  statement  under  the  Health  and  Safety  (Consultation  with  Employees) 
                 Regulations 1996: 
                 By agreement with the three recognised trade unions, Safety Representatives appointed by these Unions will also 
                 represent, with respect to the requirements of the above legislation, non-union members within their employment 
                 group. 
                 Smoking Policy 
                 The University Policy bans smoking in all University buildings. 
                 New and Expectant Mothers 
                 Many of the safety considerations for expectant mothers are important from the very early stages of pregnancy (e.g. 
                 inhalation of chemical agents). It is therefore desirable for expectant mothers to give early, informal, notice to the 
                 School. This will enable their working environment to be assessed for possible hazards. 
                 There are statutory requirements to carry out specific risk assessments on the working environment of new and 
                 expectant mothers. Thus it is in the interest of an expectant mother to notify the school as soon as possible so that 
                 these assessments can be made. 
                 Any early informal notification will be treated in confidence. The school would prefer to carry out confidential risk 
                 assessments than to discover too late that an expectant mother is working in an unsuitable environment. 
                                                                                                                                                           6 
                The University has issued guidance notes on health and safety aspects for new and expectant mothers at work. The 
                procedures laid down will only be acted upon when the University is formally notified that an employee is an expectant 
                mother. 
                Risk Assessment 
                The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 require that assessment be made of all significant risks 
                to health and safety. 
                A hazard is anything that can cause an injury or harm. The risk is the chance of that injury or harm happening. In risk 
                assessment, all the hazards should be identified and then the chances of these hazards causing injury are judged. The 
                regulations require that a risk assessment is suitable and sufficient and should identify the significant risks. This requires 
                a systematic identification of the hazards and evaluation of the risks involved, considering the precautions already in 
                place. Once the risks have been identified they should be minimised by either removing the hazard, and hence the risk, 
                or by setting up controls that minimise the risk. 
                It is important to keep a record of these assessments to show how the conclusions were reached. Any new working 
                practices that are devised to control the risk identified should also be recorded. 
                A booklet is available that gives guidance on this procedure and includes the five step procedure published by the HSE: 
                         Look for the hazards. 
                         Decide who might be harmed and how. 
                         Evaluate the risks arising from the hazards and decide whether existing precautions are adequate or whether 
                          more should be done. 
                         Record your findings. 
                         Review your assessment from time to time and revise it as necessary. 
                 
                When carrying out an assessment, various possible control measures should be considered. These are, in order of 
                desirability: 
                         Elimination - eliminate the hazard. 
                         Substitution - substitute a less hazardous substance/device. 
                         Engineering - put in place an engineered ‘barrier’ to the hazard e.g. screens or interlocks. 
                         System of work - use a written and agreed procedure, which minimises the risk. 
                         Personal Protective Equipment - as a last resort, use protective clothing. 
                A standard risk assessment pro-forma has been produced by the University Safety Office. This is reproduced in Appendix 
                B of this booklet. Copies can be printed from this booklet, or obtained from the School Safety Coordinator. The form 
                will give guidance on those items that should be considered in an assessment. This record should then be passed to the 
                School Safety Coordinator for comment before any work is undertaken. 
                Electricity 
                Electricity is dangerous because relatively small currents, a few milliamps, passing through the body can upset the heart, 
                stop breathing and disrupt the nervous system. 
                The Electricity at Work Act 1989 covers electrical safety. The University produces two booklets on this subject: 
                         Electricity  at  Work  Regulations  1989  (Guidance  notes  on  inspection  and  testing  of  portable  electrical 
                          equipment) is a slim booklet of guidance on the inspection and testing of portable electrical equipment. 
                         The University local rules for electrical safety, this is a weighty tome. 
                Both of these are available from the School Safety Coordinator or the University Environmental Health and Safety 
                Services. 
                All electrical equipment, including personal equipment, entering the school must be electrically safe. To ensure this, 
                electrical equipment must be inspected and tested regularly. All equipment has a label attached giving the date of the 
                last test. Any equipment without a label may be unsafe and must be checked/tested by Electronic Services. 
                Any faulty, or suspected faulty, equipment must be taken, or reported, to Electronic Services who will arrange testing 
                and/or repair. 
                What follows is a short reminder to be careful; the rules and regulations are set out in the booklets mentioned and 
                these should be consulted. 
                         A competent person must fit all plugs (e.g. Electronic Services). 
                         Where possible a Residual Current Device (RCD) should be fitted. 
                         All cables must be capable of handling the required current. 
                                                                                                                                                  7 
                         All live parts must be insulated, or guarded so that they cannot be touched when live. 
                         To reduce tripping hazards, and to prevent damage through kicking or flooding, all trailing extension sockets 
                          must be kept off the floor. 
                         In a laboratory, know where the main isolation switch is and how to operate it in an emergency. 
                 
                You can see the HSE version of these regulations, and other booklets relating to electrical and electronics safety, on the 
                HSE’s publications webpage. 
                Cryogenics 
                Liquefied gases, and cold objects in general, are hazardous. 
                Specialised training covering the following will be given to honours and research students. Anyone else requiring to 
                work with liquefied gases should contact the School Safety Coordinator for training. After this training you can work, 
                under supervision, with systems operating down to liquid nitrogen temperatures. Further training must be undertaken 
                from Cryogenics before working with liquid helium. 
                Anything that is below 273K (0°C) can cause burns, and the lower the temperature the more serious the skin-damage. 
                Loose fitting non-absorbent gloves should be worn if there is any chance of touching cold surfaces, since bare skin can 
                stick/freeze to the surface. Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment should always be used when handling cryogenic 
                materials. 
                A container of liquid gas holds the equivalent of about 800 times its volume of that gas. While few of our cryogenic 
                gases are toxic, only oxygen is any use for breathing. If a large volume of any other liquid gas is evaporated, this will 
                displace air, and you may be short of oxygen. Only carbon dioxide will warn you of this; inert gases cause suffocation 
                without warning. For this reason you must never travel in the lift with a Dewar containing liquid gas. Users should place 
                the Cryogenic Dewar in the lift initially, then proceed to the relevant floor via the stairs, call the lift and remove the 
                Dewar. 
                Since a small volume of liquid produces a large volume of gas, make sure that the gas boiling off has an easy escape 
                route. A liquid gas container will explode if not vented. Ensure that ice frozen out of the atmosphere (or solid air if the 
                liquid is helium) cannot block the vent. 
                Liquid nitrogen in an open-topped container is cold enough to condense out oxygen from the air; after a while there 
                can be more than half liquid oxygen in your liquid nitrogen. Increasing the concentration of  atmospheric oxygen 
                increases the risk of fire. Oil and grease should never be used on equipment for use with oxygen. 
                Plastics become brittle when cold and liquid nitrogen can cause them to shatter. For example, an electrical cable may 
                become bare wires when its plastic insulation shatters. Liquid nitrogen spills are also very good at lifting floor tiles. This 
                can generate a tripping hazard. 
                High pressure systems 
                These are defined to be any system operating at more than 0.5 bar above atmospheric pressure containing a fluid, as 
                described in the Pressure Systems and Transportable Gas Containers Regulations 2000. If the (pressure x volume) of the 
                largest vessel in the system is greater than 250 bar-litres this must be notified to the University’s nominated “competent 
                person”, who is Mr Robert Watson of Estates & Buildings. 
                Note, however, that all other pressure systems within the School, which fall outside the regulations, must be maintained 
                to the same standard. The School is responsible for the inspection and testing of all such systems. 
                All pressure systems under these regulations must be inspected by the insurers every 14 months, and be tested and 
                have their test pressure marked on them. Suitable overpressure relief valves must be fitted, and consideration given to 
                bursting discs as a backup. Any new, or modified, pressure systems must be notified to the School Safety Coordinator. 
                The University guidelines on the use of pressure systems should be consulted and followed in all cases. These guidelines 
                include the regular inspection and periodic replacement of all gas lines. All valves must be suitable for the gas being 
                handled. All regulators should be to BSEN 585 or BS 7650, inspected regularly, and serviced/replaced periodically, 
                probably at least every five years. The school is responsible for inspection/maintenance and replacement of all high 
                pressure equipment. 
                All cylinders must be kept securely restrained, transported on a trolley and never dropped. The weakest part of a 
                cylinder is the valve. If this is broken off, for example by the cylinder falling over, the cylinder will become very hazardous 
                due to the large escape of energy (cylinders are normally charged to 200 bar and weigh around 60kg). Supervisors must 
                give basic training before work is undertaken with a pressure system. 
                Always know the contents of any cylinder in your care. The colour codes on cylinders are unreliable, so check the label. 
                                                                                                                                                  8 
                You can see the HSE version of these regulations, and other booklets relating to high-pressure system safety, on the 
                HSE’s publications webpage. 
                High Pressure Water 
                The building has a high-pressure water supply used for cooling research and teaching apparatus. When demand on the 
                system is low the pressure rises to over 100 psi. 
                There is always a risk of flooding with any water supply. However, because of the high pressure of this supply, a leak 
                may spray water over a very large area. This water spray can reach electrical equipment and give a high risk of electric 
                shock. 
                All valves, fittings and hoses used on the high-pressure water system must be able to withstand pressures well in excess 
                of 100 psi. Hose connections should be rifled and the hoses clamped securely. These fittings should be regularly checked 
                to ensure that they are secure. 
                Vacuum systems 
                The greatest danger in vacuum systems comes from the use of glass components. Bell jars on coating units are a 
                particular hazard. 
                If glass is being used: 
                         Steps must be taken in the design of the system to minimise the strain on the glass. 
                         Any glass component must be surrounded by an implosion shield sufficient to contain a worst-case collapse. 
                Vacuum systems are not generally hostile provided the potential danger of an implosion is considered and precautions 
                taken to avoid a sudden inrush into the system. An inrush could be of gas, liquid or loose solid objects drawn in by the 
                gas and/or liquid. The danger is not so much the inrush, as the tendency of such material to continue in a straight line 
                and come out of the other side. 
                It is important to ensure that the vacuum pump exhaust is vented outside of the building to prevent build-up of oil-mist. 
                This mist is hazardous to health (coating inside of lungs) and will trip the fire alarm sensor resulting in a visit from the 
                emergency services. 
                Supervisors have a responsibility to give training and guidance to all members of their group. 
                Lasers 
                Coherent light sources (i.e. lasers) and high brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs) can generate significant quantities of 
                power over small areas, and at significant distances from the light source. As a consequence there are potential risks 
                associated with the use of such equipment. These include thermal injuries to the eyes and skin, photochemical reactions 
                in the eyes and skin and also the risk of fire.  
                The Control of Artificial Optical Radiation at Work Regulations 2010 requires that all work with lasers and high brightness 
                LEDs must be risk assessed and appropriate control measures implemented to eliminate or minimise the risk of injury. 
                All work involving lasers and high brightness LED’s within the School must then be carried out in accordance with the 
                University Local Rules For Work With Lasers, a copy of which can be found in each designated laser area.  This document 
                is based on the international/British Standards for work with lasers BS EN 60825. 
                It is essential for your safety, and the safety of others, that the School Safety Policy in relation to work with lasers is 
                adhered to. The School Laser Safety Policy requires all laser workers to follow at all times the rules given in the University 
                Local Rules for Work with Lasers, together with the following procedural requirements: 
                     1.        Any person working with lasers of Class 1M, 2M, 3R, 3B and 4 must be registered as a laser worker. 
                     2.        Any newly registered laser worker must be supervised by a skilled laser worker until, to the satisfaction of 
                               the Research/Service Group Head, they are sufficiently skilled as to operate safely & independently. 
                     3.        Research/Service Group Heads must notify the School Laser Safety Supervisor of all new lasers brought in 
                               and perform a suitable and sufficient risk assessment prior to their use. 
                     4.        Research/Service Group Heads must notify the School Laser Safety Supervisor of all lasers decommissioned 
                               or otherwise disposed of. 
                     5.        Research/Service Group Heads must complete and return to the School Laser Safety Supervisor an Annual 
                               Laser Safety Checklist. 
                     6.        Research/Service Group Heads must ensure there is an adequate supply of appropriate laser safety 
                               eyewear where required and that said eyewear is accessible without placing the worker at risk, e.g. outside 
                               laboratory. 
                                                                                                                                                  9 
                      7.         Research/Service Group Heads must notify the School Laser Safety Supervisor of all visiting laser workers 
                                 prior to their starting work with lasers.  
                      8.         Laser Workers visiting another institution must operate to safety standards on a par with those of the 
                                 University of St Andrews or where the other institutions procedures are more stringent to those of the 
                                 other institution. 
                      9.         Recipients  of  laser  equipment  loaned  by  the  School  to  other  Schools/Units  must  be  alerted  to  the 
                                 requirements of the University Local Rules for Work with Lasers.  Compliance with these rules is the 
                                 responsibility of the School/Unit to which the laser equipment is loaned. 
                      10.        Interlocks on doors to laser designated areas shall be inspected and tested regularly and a record of these 
                                 tests maintained by the School. 
                 In the event of an accident where eye damage is suspected, the casualty must present themselves as soon as possible 
                 to the Eye Clinic (during working hours) or Ophthalmic Ward (out of hours) at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. 
                 Supervision of compliance with the School Laser Safety Policy is delegated by the Head of School to the School Laser 
                 Safety Supervisor, Cameron Rae, who should be consulted and provide advice on laser safety matters and maintain 
                 appropriate records. 
                 Ionising Radiation 
                 Ionising Radiation includes radioactive emissions (alpha, beta & gamma rays) and X-rays. The sources of these radiations 
                 vary enormously in intensity but should all be treated with respect. 
                 The University publishes a book of Local Rules for working with Ionising Radiation. The School’s Radiation Protection 
                 Adviser, Cameron Rae, should be consulted early in the planning for any experiment involving radioactive or X-ray work. 
                 All persons working with ionising radiation must be registered with the University Safety Office as a ‘radiation worker’. 
                 The University’s Radiation Protection adviser must approve all projects (forms from the School’s Radiation Protection 
                 Adviser). 
                 Ionising Radiation can be both dangerous and emotive. Care must be taken to follow the procedures laid down in the 
                 local rules to ensure safe and acceptable working conditions. 
                 The School Radiation Protection Adviser must be consulted before ordering any source of ionising radiation. Also 
                 handling and disposal needs to be certified by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). 
                 You can see the HSE regulations, and other booklets relating to ionising radiation safety on the HSE’s publications 
                 webpage. 
                 Non-ionising Radiation 
                 The University publishes a booklet of local rules for working with non-ionising radiation (University Local Rules for work 
                 with Non-ionising Radiations Part 2 - ultraviolet radiation). A copy of this can be obtained from the School Safety 
                 Coordinator or Environmental Health and Safety Services. 
                 When working with Ultraviolet Radiation a copy of this booklet should be obtained and the procedures laid down in it 
                 should be followed. 
                 The dangers of exposure to ultraviolet radiation can be cumulative, and thus the exposure time limits for given levels of 
                 radiation must be followed carefully. 
                 Since ultraviolet radiation is invisible, a suitable method of detecting it must be available and should be used. 
                 Other forms of non-ionising radiation require different procedures for their detection and control. In particular the 
                 levels of exposure to microwaves and infra-red radiation fields must be considered if these are being generated. At 
                 present  there  is  no  published  University  Local  Rules  booklet  for  these  radiations,  but  the  National  Radiological 
                 Protection Board has specified safety levels and these should be followed. 
                 You can see the HSE regulations, and other booklets relating to non-ionising radiation safety on the HSE’s publications 
                 webpage. 
                 Electromagnetic fields 
                 There are at present no specific regulations in the United Kingdom governing the exposure of either workers or 
                 members of the public to electromagnetic fields at frequencies below 300 GHz. 
                                                                                                                                                          10 
                The acceptable level of exposure to fields in this frequency range is a very controversial subject. There have been a 
                number of articles in the press that suggest low limits should be imposed, e.g. Electronics World & Wireless World, Feb 
                1990 pp96-124. 
                A  paper  produced  in  1982  by  the  National  Radiological  Protection  Board  (NRPB)  gives  the  range  of  national 
                recommendations for maximum exposure for given frequencies below 300 GHz. At the time these ranged from  
                         -2                    -2
                0.5 Wm  (USSR) to 100 Wm  (UK), a factor of 200. 
                The UK recommendation was based on thermal effects on body tissue, while the USSR recommendation was based on 
                functional disturbance to laboratory animals, i.e. do not upset the nervous system. The latest recommendations from 
                the NRPB are published in ‘Broad Statement on Restriction on Human Expose to Static and Time Varying Electromagnetic 
                Fields and Radiation’ ISBN 0 85951 366 1 from HMSO. These are based on the field required to avoid 3 different effects: 
                         Thermal effects on body tissue, especially the eyes. 
                         Maximum current in limbs 
                         Electric shock and RF burns. 
                           
                The NRPB recommendations are different for near-field and far-field, and for different parts of the body. It would be 
                best to consult them yourself for each experimental set-up. 
                These radiation levels are only recommendations and it is up to the individual experimenter to set and monitor their 
                own limits, probably after consulting the literature. However, the recommended safety levels should not be exceeded 
                in any circumstances. 
                Static Magnetic Fields 
                Strong magnetic fields require to be treated with considerable respect. Apart from the obvious danger of loose magnetic 
                objects flying towards the poles of a strong magnet, there are other possible dangers. For example, blood is a conducting 
                fluid and it moves as it circulates around the body. Thus your circulation is a moving conductor in a magnetic field. Any 
                magnetic field should not be strong enough to affect the circulation. 
                The recommended limits for exposure to static magnetic fields given by the National Radiological Protection Board are 
                as follows: 
                     1.   Short-term exposure to the head and trunk should not exceed 2 tesla (T), and for the limbs 4 T. A ‘short’ period 
                          is defined as less than 15 minutes, not repeated for at least an hour. 
                     2.   Long-term  exposure  (8  hours  per  day)  should  not  exceed  1  mT.  (e.g.  the  immediate  environment  of 
                          superconducting magnets is often close to this limit.) 
                     3.   Metal surgical implants should be kept away from strong fields and strong fields may affect pacemakers. 
                          Notices should be posted to warn people with these devices to keep away. 
                Consideration is being given to having areas with fields greater than 1 mT classified as controlled areas. However, 
                specialists at Ninewells Hospital have suggested that the maximum field for heart pacemakers should be 0.5 mT. It is 
                suggested that the 1 mT limit should be determined and the extent of the 0.5 mT field should be marked clearly on the 
                floor of labs containing superconducting magnet systems. 
                When working with superconducting magnets ensure your working practice allows for a rapid evacuation in case the 
                magnet should ‘quench’ (revert to normal resistance) and evaporate the contents of the Dewar. To protect the user 
                from the high voltages generated during the dissipation of electrical energy during a ‘quench’, care should be taken with 
                the earthing of the system. 
                Hazardous Substances 
                The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) regulations require that the school carries out risk assessments 
                for all procedures within the school involving the use of substances which pose a significant risk to health. 
                The assessment is required for the procedure, not the substance. The supervisor of the project is responsible for doing 
                the assessment, which must be done before any new substances are ordered. The assessment will require information 
                on all the substance to be used, any generated by reactions, and on the proposed disposal of any residues. This 
                assessment is completed electronically on the CHARM system but is not valid until electronically signed by the worker 
                and the supervisor. 
                It is important to plan the disposal of surplus chemicals and residues from reactions at this stage. It is possible that the 
                disposal may incur a substantial cost. 
                                                                                                                                                  11 
                All chemicals (and any other ‘hazardous substance’) must be brought into the school via the Stores. They may only be 
                collected from the Stores by persons named on the risk assessment form. All substances entering the school should 
                have hazard information on the label or have a product safety data sheet. When ordering any chemicals, ensure that 
                this safety information is provided. Separate data sheets, or copies of them, may be lodged with the School Safety 
                Coordinator if there is any likelihood of them getting lost. 
                If you have ordered chemicals, and they did not come with a product safety data sheet, check with the School Safety 
                Coordinator. Sometimes suppliers send the data sheets under separate cover to the 'safety officer'. 
                A product safety data sheet must accompany any hazardous materials passed to the workshop. 
                Waste disposal 
                The duty of care in disposal of all waste rests with the waste producer until safe disposal has been carried out. The 
                Special  Waste  Regulations  controls  the  transport  of  waste  and  adds  new  categories  of  waste  and  controls  their 
                movement. The responsibility for waste does not end when it leaves the building, and liability may continue for some 
                time if the method of disposal used was not suitable. 
                The school has an agreement with Fife Council, as the local waste disposal authority, for the removal and disposal of 
                “domestic” type waste. This specifically excludes any waste that could be classed as hazardous. The University has 
                published a combined document giving guidance on the routes for recycling of different types of waste and also on 
                disposal  of  hazardous  substances  from  laboratories.  This  document  is  available  on  the  EHSS  website  at  URL: 
                http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/staff/policy/healthandsafety/publications/  
                 Any waste that is not non-hazardous “domestic” waste must be disposed of by other means. The University Safety 
                Office can arrange disposal of these substances. You will however have to pay the commercial rate for their disposal 
                and this should be considered when applying for funding for the research in the first instance. 
                Disposal of sharps also requires special care. We have a sharps container, which is held in the main Stores. This should 
                be used for the disposal of all sharps. Because of the type of danger caused by sharps, the container must be taken to 
                the sharp that is to be disposed of. DO NOT take the sharp through the building to the container. 
                Radioactive sharps must not be disposed of by this route. If you expect to produce any radioactive sharps you must 
                contact the School Safety Coordinator. Arrangements for their disposal can then be made before any sharps are 
                produced. 
                The School Safety Coordinator acts as a clearing house for requests for waste disposal and will arrange for the required 
                paperwork. Disposal must be done by this route as records have to be kept centrally by the University. There are now 
                heavy fines for not following the correct disposal procedures. 
                Consignments for disposal must be accompanied by a completed form. The form should be e-mailed to the University 
                Safety  Office,  ehss@st-andrews.ac.uk.  The  consignment  form  can  be  downloaded  from  http://www.st-
                andrews.ac.uk/physics/safety/resources/Blank-Lab-Smalls-List.xls. The Safety Office will not accept hand-written forms, 
                “it is taking up a lot of time trying to decipher some members of staff handwriting”. 
                Glass disposal. 
                Winchester/Glass bottles which cannot be returned to the suppliers must be disposed of as follows:  
                                        Plastic cap must be removed and discarded in the normal waste bin. 
                                        The original contents must be completely removed, and then the bottle must be thoroughly 
                                         washed with excess water to remove all traces of chemicals. 
                                        The labels should be removed from the bottles or defaced to indicate that the bottle no longer 
                                         contains the specified substance. 
                                        The clean bottle must then be placed in the appropriate waste/recycling bin. 
                                          
                No other materials may be placed in this container.  
                Some types of glass are not accepted for recycling, e.g. pyrex, quickfit glass. Please check this before placement in glass 
                recycling bins. 
                It is essential that this bin be kept free of contamination otherwise Fife Council will simply refuse to uplift it. 
                Waste disposal classes. 
                The school has a commercial waste disposal agreement with Fife Council for waste transfer. This covers the rubbish that 
                goes out in black bags. 
                The agreement specifies that Fife Council will accept for transfer and disposal the following waste: 
                                                                                                                                                 12 
                         Office debris; food scraps; paper & plastic packing material; floor sweeping and other cleaning waste; wood, 
                          metal and plastic waste from mechanical and electrical workshops. 
                           
                Any waste not described in the above must be disposed of by special arrangement. 
                Waste is classified as ‘special’ or ‘controlled’. All ‘special’ waste must be disposed of through the University Safety Office, 
                this can be arranged by the School Safety Coordinator. 
                Personal Protective Equipment 
                The Personal Protective Equipment at Work (PPE) Regulations 1992 are now in force. Supervisors are expected to 
                provide personal protective equipment and the training in its use. It is expected that people will use personal protective 
                equipment as required when undertaking any hazardous operation. 
                Within  the  Physical  Sciences  building  there  are  areas  where  personal  protective  equipment  must  be  used.  The 
                mechanical workshop must not be entered unless eye protection is worn. Part of the cryogenics area is a noisy area and 
                ear defenders should be worn when working in this area. 
                Gloves should be worn to protect your hand when manual-handling containers or materials. 
                Rubber-gloves should be worn when handling chemicals or biological samples. These should be removed and disposed 
                of prior to leaving the laboratory. This eliminates any contamination of other building areas. 
                Manual-handling gloves and rubber-gloves can be obtained from the School’s Stores. 
                You can see the HSE regulations, and other booklets relating to personal protective equipment on the HSE’s publications 
                webpage. 
                Security 
                The security of the building has a direct influence on the safety of the working environment. There are many areas in 
                the building that, while not directly hazardous, could be made dangerous by the untrained person. 
                The security of the building requires the cooperation of everybody working in it. If you see a stranger wandering round, 
                offer to help them. 
                Outside normal working hours the building is locked. 
                Keys are issued where required, a £10.00 deposit is taken at the time of issue and refunded when the key is returned. 
                You are reminded that when you stop working in the school you are required to return your keys. 
                Out of Hours working 
                If you are working outside normal working hours (after 10pm) you must sign-in on one of the sheets provided at the 
                main entrance or at the back door (by the Stores). When leaving you must sign out to indicate you are no longer in the 
                building. 
                This list is essential if there is a fire: 
                         if you are signed in then you will be searched for. 
                         if you are not signed in then no-one will know to search for you. 
                           
                Similarly, failure to sign out puts at risk the lives of those searching for you. I am sure you do not want your failure to 
                sign out to cause injury to others. 
                Lone-working 
                The School has a Lone Working policy and this can be found on the School web pages under Students & Staff, then 
                Safety at:  https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/safety/index.php , the policy is at the bottom of the page under 
                ‘Other safety documents’. 
                Noise 
                There is a general duty to reduce all noise levels as much as is reasonably possible. 
                There are statutory thresholds for working in a noisy environment. There are also limits for transients and pressure 
                pulses. 
                                                                                                                                                 13 
               Where a noise hazard is suspected, a competent person (e.g. University Safety Adviser) must assess the noise hazard. 
               When one of the thresholds is exceeded then appropriate action must be taken to reduce such noise to permitted levels. 
               Where ear defenders are provided they must be worn. 
               Hearing loss can be irreversible if the total and/or peak exposure has exceeded some threshold (which varies from 
               person to person). This threshold is usually close to the action levels defined above. You can see the HSE regulations, 
               and other booklets relating to noise safety on the HSE’s publications webpage. 
               Visual display workstations (Display Screen Equipment) 
               Regulations  are  in  force  which  require  users  of  workstations  to  undergo  basic  training,  and  to  have  a  working 
               environment that satisfies certain safety criteria. These criteria relate to seating, lighting and organisation of equipment. 
               The criteria are designed to reduce the stresses and strains of using the workstation. 
               The regulations require that the DSE user be trained in the use of their DSE equipment and that their workstation should 
               be risk assessed. A DSE user is defined as anyone who uses a VDU for prolonged periods; this is taken as regular, 
               continuous spells of an hour or more. In the School of Physics and Astronomy that is likely to be the majority of staff. 
               All DSE users are required to take a DSE training course and to have their workstations risk-assessed. 
               DSE training and workstation risk assessment is undertaken by means of completion of the Cardinus online course. The 
               Cardinus course is available at the following URL:      
                                        https://secure.cardinus.com/launch.asp?id=ustan22439  
               The training will take around 30 minutes to complete; thereafter you will be required to undertake a ten question 
               multiple-choice test in which you must achieve 80% to be deemed to have passed. 
               Getting started with Cardinus & Training 
                                                             When you first try to use the Cardinus package you will have to register 
                                                             your details. You should use your IT Services username / email address as

                                         Safety Training and Risk Assessment at your own pace, logging out and into the system 
                                         whenever you like using your IT Services username as you identity. 
                                         The Cardinus system ensures that you are actually reading the information by giving you little 
                                         interactive sequences to complete at the end of certain blocks of text, e.g. “Place mouse over 
                                         picture”, “Click to view”, etc. It is best just to read through the text rather than to “try to get 
                                         the training over as quickly as possible”! 
                                         At the end of the four training modules you will be given a few conclusions, and then a multiple 
                                         choice test consisting of ten questions. You need to get eight of the ten questions correct to 
                                         be deemed to have passed the training.

                 status information 
                                         Once you have finished the Safety Training, you can move straight on to the Risk Assessment. 
               The risk assessment consists of 53 questions about your workstation environment. These are a sequence of Yes/No 
               answers – be careful to read the questions and not just keep to the Yes, Yes, Yes sequence as there are a couple of 
               curve-balls in there. 
                                                                                                                                       14 
                Document Holder 
                During the risk assessment questionnaire you will be asked about your document holder. If you do not have, and do not 
                need one, then it is probably best to pretend that the one you don’t have, or need, is: adjustable for height and tilt 
                (Q31), suitable for purpose (Q32), satisfactorily sited (Q33). This will save you having a User Action at the end to rectify 
                problems with your non-existent document holder! 
                User Action report 
                At the end of the Risk Assessment you will be given a “User Action Report”. This gives you information on issues that 
                you need to resolve in order to ensure that your Workstation is not causing you any Health or Safety problems. Where 
                appropriate, you should speak to your supervisor to request that appropriate changes be made, or equipment be 
                purchased or replaced. 
                More details on the safe use of DSE equipment are given in the Health and Safety Executive’s Display Screen Equipment 
                web pages at the URL: http://www.hse.gov.uk/msd/dse/. 
                Manual Handling 
                The Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 came into force in January 1993, and were amended in 2002. The 
                purpose of the regulations is to reduce the risk of injury from manual handling operations involving heavy or awkward 
                loads. The University has published a set of guidance notes based on these regulations. 
                To comply with these regulations an employer must, among other things, identify all manual-handling operations 
                undertaken by its employees. 
                To this end it is required that all members of the school are aware of this requirement and co-operate in identifying 
                such operations. The great majority of manual handling within the school is the one-off lifting and/or moving of single 
                items. Before any such job is undertaken the risk must be assessed. This risk assessment must be done by a trained 
                assessor (see list of safety duties). 
                When considering a manual handling operation the following options for reducing the load should be considered (in 
                this order): 
                         Split the load into smaller, more manageable units. 
                         Get help to move the load. 
                         Use a mechanical aid (barrow or hoist). There are barrows provided. These are kept inside the loading bay and 
                          must be returned after use. 
                           
                If in doubt, ask for help and don't do the job by yourself. 
                Advice on manual handling operation can be found in the university booklet Guidance Notes for Manual Handling 
                Operations, obtainable from the School Safety Coordinator or Environmental Health and Safety Services. 
                Handling Gas Cylinders 
                The handling of gas cylinders is a regular job in the School so a guide to risk and handling procedures are as follows: 
                There are two main hazards in the handling of a gas cylinder. They are heavy and a difficult shape to control, thus they 
                can fall over and cause damage or injury. If they fall over the valve may get damaged and if broken off, the cylinder will 
                become very hazardous; when the cylinder is full (200bar) it contains a large amount of stored energy. 
                To minimise these problems, all cylinders must be transported on an approved trolley. These trolleys are shaped to hold 
                the cylinder and have extensions to the rear at the bottom to prevent them falling backwards onto the person pushing 
                them. The cylinder must be secured to the trolley during transit and kept secured before and after being moved. 
                Anybody handling a cylinder must have been trained by a person competent in moving a cylinder safely. 
                Handling large or awkward boxes and parcels 
                The School gets regular deliveries of large and awkward boxes. These often contain equipment ordered by research 
                groups. A guide to the risk involved in handling these follows: 
                Many items come well packaged in large boxes. While these are not heavy they are difficult to lift. The major hazard 
                from handling these boxes is personal injury due to incorrect posture during the lift/carry. The handling of any box larger 
                than an A4 paper box should be considered hazardous. Similarly anything heavier than about 5kg may be hazardous, 
                especially if it is bigger than the A4 paper box mentioned above. 
                To reduce the danger of injury from moving large or awkward loads, barrows are available. They should be kept in, and 
                returned to, the loading bay next to the workshop door. These barrows should be used to move all large or awkward 
                loads around the building. 
                                                                                                                                                 15 
        Any item that cannot easily be lifted by two people onto one of these barrows is classed as a difficult lift and advice 
        must be obtained from the appropriate person listed on the list of School Safety Duties. 
        Confined Spaces 
        Regulations are now in force concerning work in confined spaces. A confined space is defined as one with either limited 
        ventilation or restricted access. 
        The main areas for working in confined spaces are under the floor on level one (foundations of the building) and in the 
        pipe duct from the boiler house to the west. When working in such areas a second person must be present at the 
        entrance to the area to ensure assistance can be called immediately in case of an accident. When working in these areas 
        you should either carry two torches in case of failure, or use a lamp with a trailing flex (this may be followed to lead you 
        out or a rescuer in). 
        If you have to work in one of these areas then the School Safety Coordinator should be consulted to ensure that the 
        scheme of work to be followed would be within the regulations. 
        The HSE’s publications webpages contain information on this subject. It is recommended that this site should be 
        consulted as it gives very good guidance on this topic. 
        Access to Roof 
        Access to the roof of the Physical Sciences building is controlled by a permit-to-work system. There are a number of 
        hazards involved in accessing the roof and so local rules have been produced and a permit-to-work must be obtained. 
        The roof has an unprotected edge, and a number of fume cupboard discharge flues. These are all covered in the local 
        rules and before work starts a permit-to-work certificate must be completed. 
        The local rules, and the permit-to-work certificate can be found in Appendix C and Appendix D of this booklet. 
        Work Equipment 
        The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 replace several acts covering the operation of specific types 
        of equipment. 
        The regulations cover the safety aspects of all Work Equipment. This is everything from a screwdriver, hammer or drill 
        bit, through portable drills, computers, lasers and tractors to cooling towers and blast furnaces. 
        The regulations require that the equipment should be suitable for the purpose, be installed safely and be safe to 
        operate. For example, the law requires that guards be fitted to pillar drills and other rotating machinery. Authorisation 
        must be obtained before using powered equipment in workshops. For each machine used proper certificated training 
        and a demonstration of competence must be shown to supervisors of workshops and labs. 
        The HSE’s publications webpages have leaflets relating to safety and Work equipment. 
                                                                       16

                List outstanding risks and the action to be taken where it is reasonably practicable to do more: 
                 
                Give priority to those risks which affect large numbers of people and/or could result in serious harm. Apply the following 
                principles, if possible, in the following order: 
                 
                         Remove the risk completely; 
                         Try a less risky option; 
                         Prevent access to the hazard (e.g. guarding); 
                         Organise work to reduce exposure to the hazard; 
                         Issue personal protective equipment; 
                         Provide welfare facilities (e.g. washing facilities for removal of contamination and first-aid); 
                 
                                  Risks not adequately controlled                                      Further action to be taken

      Building  
       
       
      A permit-to-work must be obtained for all access/work on the roof 
       
      The following local rules must be observed by all persons (University employees & outside Contractors) when on the 
      roof of the Physical Sciences building. 
       
      1) Access to the whole roof will be subject to permission being granted by the School Safety Coordinator. 
       
      2) The roof has an unguarded edge except for small areas by the access door. If working within 2m of an edge (as 
      indicated by the marked line), a safety barrier must be erected and/or safety lines used (by suitably qualified persons).  
       
      3) There are low level fume cupboard extract vents in the SW & NE corners of the roof. Before work is done in these 
      areas appropriate warning notices must be in place in a prominent position at the fume cupboards banning use while 
      the permit-to-work is in operation. 
       
      4) Any person on the roof experiencing an unpleasant smell from a flue outlet must immediately leave the roof and 
      contact the School Safety Coordinator (Derek Milroy). Nobody should re-enter the roof unless they have received 
      permission to do so from the School Safety Coordinator (Derek Milroy). 
       
      5) There are 3m high discharge flues from the clean room in the SE corner of the building. Before work is done down-
      wind of these the clean room staff must be notified and all toxic discharges stopped. 
       
       
      Emergency Procedure 
       
      On hearing the fire alarm (an electronic siren), quickly make safe any equipment (e.g. hot work), then evacuate the 
      building and assemble outside the main entrance. If the escape stair is smoke filled retreat to a safe area and wait for 
      instructions from the Emergency Services. 
       
      Note: Every other Monday at 3pm the alarm will sound for up to 30 seconds to conduct a weekly test. At all other times 
      the building must be evacuated if the alarm is heard.
