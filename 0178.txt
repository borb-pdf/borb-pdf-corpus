         31  SUMMARY 
          Keep in current flying practice, have an annual c-oheut wck ith particular 
            emphasis on stall recognition and asymmetric practice in twins. 
          Get an aviation weather forecast. 
          Prepare a thorough Route Paln using the latest charts, check on NOTMAs, 
            Temporary Nav warnings etc. 
          Know the aircraft thoroughly. 
          Don’t over-load the aircraft. 
          Make sure the runway is long enough in the conditions. 
          Over water in a singl-eengined aircraft, wear a lifejacket (perhaps also an 
            immersion suit), carry an accessible life-raft. 
          Pre-flight properly with special emphasis on fuel/oil contents and flying 
            controls.  
          In a single-engined aircraft, bear in mind the consequences of engine failure.  
          Maintain a good look-out, scan effectively, be aware of ‘threat areas’. 
          If the weather deteriorates, or night approaches, make the decision to divert or 
            return early. 
          Don’t end up in weather outside your ability or licence privileges. 
          NEVER descend below your Safety Altitude in IMC. 
          Request help early if lost or you have other problems, e.g. fuel shortage. 
          Keep out of controlled airspace unless you have clearance. 
          Make regular cruise checks including fuel contents/selection and carb heat. 
          Maintain flying speed, avoid inadvertent stall/spin, don’t fly low and slow. 
          Always treat propellers as ‘live’. 
          Don’t do anything stupid - become an old pilot, NOT a bold pilot. 
          
         Finally -  
         •  Pilots exercising GOOD AIRMANSHIP never sit there ‘doing nothin g’th,ey 
            always think 15 to 20 miles ahead.
