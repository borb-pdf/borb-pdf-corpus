        The simpliifed asylum 
        procedure 
         
        You are from a safe country of origin or you 
        already have international protection in another 
        Member State of the European Union
       Why have you been handed this lealfet?
       You wish to apply for asylum in the Netherlands. Asylum means: protection 
       for those people who can ifnd no safety or protection in their own country.
       When you apply for asylum, you are asking the Dutch government for 
       a residence permit. You need this permit to be allowed to live and work 
       in the Netherlands.
       The asylum procedure starts atfer you have submitted your asylum 
       application: a legal procedure during which the Dutch government will 
       assess whether or not you will be granted a residence permit.
       This lealfet explains the course of your asylum procedure. It also tells you 
       what you are expected to do (your obligations) and what you may expect 
       from the Dutch government (your rights).

         When will you be given a temporary 
         asylum residence permit?
         The Dutch Aliens Act outlines the conditions under which you can 
         be granted an asylum residence permit. You will be eligible for a 
         residence permit if: 
           You have a well-founded fear of persecution in your country 
          of origin because of your race, religion, nationality, political 
          opinion or because you belong to a speciifc social group, or; 
           You have well-founded reasons to fear the death penalty or 
          execution, torture or another form of inhumane or humiliating 
          treatment in your country of origin, or; 
           You have well-founded reasons to fear becoming a victim of 
          random violence from armed conlfict in your country of origin, or;
           Your spouse, partner, father, mother or minor child has recently 
          received an asylum residence permit in the Netherlands.
         Because you come from a safe country of origin, or you already have 
         international protection in another Member State of the European 
         Union, the IND is likely to conclude that you do not meet these 
         conditions. Your asylum application will therefore be processed 
         in a simpliifed and accelerated procedure.
