  OGD (Gastroscopy)
  Information for patients
  This leaflet answers some of the questions you may have about having 
  an OGD. It explains the risks and the benefits of the test and what you 
  can expect when you come to hospital. If you have any questions or 
  concerns, please do not hesitate to speak to the doctors or nurses 
  caring for you.
   Confirming your identity 
   Before you have a treatment or procedure, our staff will ask you your
   name and date of birth and check your ID band. If you don’t have
   an ID band we will also ask you to confirm your address.
   If we don’t ask these questions, then please ask us to check.
   Ensuring your safety is our primary concern.
