        According to Wikipedia, The Outsiders is a coming-of-age novel by S. E. Hinton, first 
        published in 1967 by Viking Press. Hinton was 15 when she started writing the novel, but 
        did most of the work when she was sixteen and a junior in high school. Hinton was 18 
        when the book was published.  
         
        The book follows two rival groups, the Greasers and the Socs who are divided by their 
        socioeconomic status. 
         
        The book takes place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1965, but it is never stated in the book.
