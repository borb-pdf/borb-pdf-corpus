     Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in pregnancy 
     and newborn babies
     About this information
     This information is for you if you (or a friend or relative) are expecting a baby, planning to become pregnant 
     or have recently had a baby. It tells you about group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection in babies in the first 
     week after birth (known as early-onset GBS) and provides links to further information about late-onset GBS 
     infection. It includes the current UK recommendations for preventing GBS infection in newborn babies.
     A glossary of all medical terms is available on the RCOG website at: www.rcog.org.uk/en/patients/medical-
     terms.
       Key points
        Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the many bacteria that normally live in our bodies and 
         which usually cause no harm.
        Screening for GBS is not routinely offered to all pregnant women in the UK.
        If you carry GBS, most of the time your baby will be born safely and will not develop an infection. 
         However, it can rarely cause serious infection such as sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis.
        Most early-onset GBS infections are preventable.
        If GBS is found in your urine, vagina or rectum (bowel) during your current pregnancy,  
         or if you have previously had a baby affected by GBS infection, you should be offered  
         antibiotics in labour to reduce the small risk of this infection to your baby.
        The risk of your baby becoming unwell with GBS infection is increased if your  
         baby is born preterm, if you have a temperature while you are in  
         labour, or if your waters break before you go into labour.
        If your newborn baby develops signs of GBS infection, they should be  
         treated with antibiotics straight away.

                What is GBS?
                GBS is a common bacterium (bug) which is carried in the vagina and                                                rectum of 2–4 in 10 women (20–40%) 
                in the UK. GBS is not a sexually transmitted disease and most women carrying GBS will have no symptoms. 
                Carrying GBS is not harmful to you but it can affect your baby around the time of birth. GBS can 
                occasionally cause serious infection in newborn babies, and, very rarely, during pregnancy and before labour.
                How is GBS found?
                GBS is sometimes found during pregnancy when you have vaginal or rectal swabs or a urine test.
                In the UK, the NHS does not routinely offer all pregnant women screening for GBS. For more information 
                about available tests, visit the Group B Strep Support (GBSS) website: www.gbss.org.uk/TestingforGBS.
                What could GBS mean for my baby?
                Many babies come into contact with GBS during labour or around birth. The vast majority of these babies 
                will not become ill. However, if you carry GBS, there is a small chance that your baby will develop GBS 
                infection and become seriously ill, or even die.
                Around 1 in every 1750 newborn babies in the UK and Ireland is diagnosed with early-onset GBS infection. 
                The infections that GBS most commonly causes in newborn babies are sepsis (infection of the blood), 
                pneumonia (infection in the lungs) and meningitis (infection of the fluid and lining around the brain).
                Although GBS infection can make your baby very unwell, with prompt treatment most babies will recover 
                fully. However, of the babies who develop early-onset GBS infection, 1 in 19 (5.2%) will die and, of the 
                survivors, 1 in 14 (7.4%) will have a long-term disability.
                On average in the UK, every month:
                         43 babies develop early-onset GBS infection
                         38 babies make a full recovery
                         3 babies survive with long-term physical or mental disabilities
                         2 babies die from their early-onset GBS infection.
                What puts my baby at higher risk of 
                developing GBS infection?
                Infection is more likely to happen if:
                         your baby is born preterm (before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy) – the earlier your baby is 
                               born, the greater the risk
                         you have previously had a baby affected by GBS infection
                         you have had a high temperature or other signs of infection during labour
                         you have had any positive urine or swab test for GBS in this pregnancy
                         your waters have broken more than 24 hours before your baby is born.
                How can the risk to my baby be reduced?
                         A urine infection caused by GBS should be treated with antibiotic tablets straight away and you 
                               should also be offered antibiotics through a drip during labour.
                         You should be offered antibiotics through a drip during labour if you have had a GBS-positive 
                               swab or urine test from an NHS or other accredited laboratory (see the GBSS website for further 
                               information: www.gbss.org.uk/TestingforGBS).
                                                                                                          2
         If you have previously had a baby who was diagnosed with GBS infection, you should be offered 
           antibiotics through a drip when you are in labour.
         If your waters break after 37 weeks of your pregnancy and you are known to carry GBS, you will 
           be offered induction of labour straight away. This is to reduce the time that your baby is exposed 
           to GBS before birth. You should also be offered antibiotics through a drip.
         Even if you are not known to carry GBS, if you develop any signs of infection in labour, you will be 
           offered antibiotics through a drip that will treat a wide range of infections including GBS.
         If your labour starts before 37 weeks of your pregnancy, your healthcare professional will 
           recommend that you have antibiotics through a drip even if you are not known to carry GBS.
      What are my options for where I can have my baby?
      You should discuss your planned place of birth with your healthcare professional during pregnancy to 
      make sure that you can receive antibiotics as required in labour. If you choose to have antibiotics, they will 
      be given through a drip and it may not always be possible to arrange this at home or in some midwifery-
      led units.
      As soon as you go into labour or your waters break, contact your healthcare professional as it is important 
      that you have antibiotics as soon as possible. You should always let your healthcare professional know if you 
      have previously had a baby who had GBS infection or if you have tested positive for GBS in this pregnancy.
      If GBS has been found, when should I have antibiotics?
      If you are found to carry GBS in your vagina or rectum, treating you with antibiotics before your labour 
      begins does not reduce the chance of your baby developing GBS infection. You do not need antibiotic 
      treatment until labour starts, when you will be offered antibiotics through a drip to reduce the chance of 
      your baby being infected. These antibiotics reduce the risk of your baby developing a GBS infection in their 
      first week of life from around 1 in 400 to 1 in 4000.
      If GBS is found in your urine then you will need antibiotics as soon as it is diagnosed to treat your urinary 
      tract infection; you will also be offered antibiotics through a drip during labour to prevent GBS infection in 
      your baby.
      There are other situations where you will be offered antibiotics but these are not specifically related to 
      GBS infection:
         If your waters break preterm (before 37 weeks) but you are not in labour, you may be offered a 
           course of antibiotics. See the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline NG25 
           on Preterm Labour and Birth: www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng25/ifp/chapter/If-your-waters-break-early.
         If you are having a planned caesarean section and you carry GBS, you do not need antibiotics 
           to prevent GBS infection in your baby unless labour has started or your waters have broken. 
           All women having a caesarean section will be offered antibiotics at the time of the operation to 
           reduce the risk of a wide variety of infections.
      If I had GBS in a previous pregnancy, should I be given 
      antibiotics during labour?
         If a previous baby was affected with GBS infection then you should be offered antibiotics during 
           labour in all following pregnancies, as there is an increased risk that a future baby may also 
           be affected.
         If, however, GBS was found in a previous pregnancy and your baby was unaffected, then there 
           is a 1 in 2 (50%) chance that you will be carrying it again in this pregnancy. To help you choose 
                                     3
             whether you would like to have antibiotics in labour, you can have a specific swab test (known as 
             the enriched culture medium or ECM test) to see whether you are carrying GBS  when you are 
             35–37 weeks pregnant. If the result shows that:
                {{ you are still carrying GBS at this stage of pregnancy then the risk of your baby developing 
                   early-onset GBS infection is increased to around 1 in 400 and you will be offered 
                   antibiotics in labour
                {{ you are not carrying GBS at this stage of pregnancy then the risk of your baby developing 
                   early-onset GBS infection is much lower (1 in 5000) and you may choose not to have 
                   antibiotics.
       What will my treatment during labour involve?
       If you have been offered antibiotics to prevent GBS infection in your baby, these should be started as soon 
       as possible after your labour begins, or after your waters have broken. They will be given through a drip 
       and continued at regular intervals (usually 4-hourly) until your baby is born.
       You should still be able to move around freely during labour and this should not stop you from having a 
       water birth.
       If your waters break before labour, your healthcare professional will talk to you about when you will 
       need antibiotics and about the best time for your baby to be born. This will depend on your individual 
       circumstances and on how many weeks pregnant you are.
       The antibiotic that you will be offered to prevent GBS infection in your baby is usually penicillin. If you are 
       allergic to penicillin then you will be offered a suitable alternative.
       Can antibiotics in labour cause any harm?
       Some women may experience temporary side effects such as feeling sick or having diarrhoea. Women 
       can be allergic to certain antibiotics and in rare cases the reaction may be severe and life-threatening 
       (anaphylaxis). Tell your healthcare professional if you know that you are allergic to penicillin or any 
       other medications.
       Your healthcare professional should discuss with you the benefits and risks of taking antibiotics in labour to 
       prevent early-onset GBS infection in your baby.
       If you choose not to have antibiotics in labour then your baby will be monitored closely for 12 hours after 
       birth as they are at increased risk of developing early-onset GBS infection.
       How will my baby be monitored after birth?
       If your baby is born at full term (after 37 completed weeks) and you received antibiotics through a drip in 
       labour at least 4 hours before giving birth then your baby does not need special monitoring after birth.
       If your baby is felt to be at higher risk of GBS infection and you did not get antibiotics through a drip at least 
       4 hours before giving birth then your baby will be monitored closely for signs of infection for at least 12 hours. 
       This will include assessing your baby’s general wellbeing, heart rate, temperature, breathing and feeding.
       If you have previously had a baby affected by GBS infection then your baby will be monitored for 12 hours 
       even if you had antibiotics through a drip in labour.
       The chance of your baby developing GBS infection after 12 hours is very low and neither you nor your 
       baby will need antibiotics after this time unless you or your baby becomes ill.
                                           4
      What are the signs of GBS infection in my baby?
      Most babies who develop GBS infection become unwell in the first week of life (which is known as early-
      onset GBS infection), usually within 12–24 hours of birth. Although less common, late-onset GBS infection 
      can affect your baby up until they are 3 months old. Having antibiotics during labour does not prevent late-
      onset GBS. More information on late-onset GBS infection is available here: www.gbss.org.uk/infection.
      Babies with early-onset GBS infection may show the following signs:
          grunting, noisy breathing, moaning, seeming to be working hard to breathe when you look at their 
           chest or tummy, or not breathing at all
          be very sleepy and/or unresponsive
          be crying inconsolably
          be unusually floppy
          not feeding well or not keeping milk down
          have a high or low temperature and/or their skin feels too hot or cold
          have changes in their skin colour (including blotchy skin)
          have an abnormally fast or slow heart rate or breathing rate
          have low blood pressure*
          have low blood sugar.*
      *identified by tests done in hospital
      If you notice any of these signs or are worried about your baby, you should urgently contact your 
      healthcare professional and also mention GBS. If your baby has GBS infection, early diagnosis and treatment 
      is important as delay could be very serious or even fatal.
      What tests and treatments are available for my baby?
      If it is thought that your newborn baby has an infection, tests will be done to see whether GBS is the cause. 
      This may involve taking a sample of your baby’s blood, or a sample of fluid from around your baby’s spinal 
      cord (a lumbar puncture). This will be discussed fully with you before the tests are done.
      Babies with signs of GBS infection or babies who are suspected to have the infection should be treated 
      with antibiotics as soon as possible. Antibiotics can be life-saving when given to babies with suspected 
      infection. Treatment will be stopped if there is no sign of infection after at least 36 hours, and all the tests 
      are negative.
      Can I still breastfeed?
      It is safe to breastfeed your new baby. Breastfeeding has not been shown to increase the risk of GBS 
      infection, and it offers many benefits to both you and your baby.
      Why aren’t all women tested for GBS 
      during pregnancy in the UK?
      The UK National Screening Committee does not recommend testing all pregnant women for the presence 
      of GBS using vaginal and rectal swabs. This is because:
          many women carry the GBS bacteria and, in the majority of cases, their babies are born safely and 
           do not develop an infection
          screening all women late in pregnancy cannot accurately predict which babies will develop 
           GBS infection
                                      5
                                       no screening test is entirely accurate: a negative swab test does not guarantee that you do not 
                                                  carry GBS
                                       many babies who are severely affected by GBS infection are born preterm, before the suggested 
                                                  time for screening (35–37 weeks)
                                       giving antibiotics to all women who carry GBS would mean that a very large number of women 
                                                  would receive treatment they do not need.
