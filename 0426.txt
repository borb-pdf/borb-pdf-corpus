          INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS 
          Introduction 
          The Australian Government has identified innovations in finantceialch nology – or “FinTech” – as 
          potentially transformative for the Australian economy. Australia’s ambition is to be a global leader in 
          technology and financial innovation that will contribute to productivity and economic growth, as well 
          as the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system over the long term. 
          A relatively recent financial innovation that is attracting much attention, both domestically and 
          globally, is the so-called initial coin offering (hereafter, ICO). ICOs, which rely on distribeudt ledger 
          technology (DLT ),emerged as a niche form of private fundraising within the technologically 
          sophisticated developer community. ICOs have since taken on public appeal, with offers being made 
          to mass retail investors. Although ICOs have some parallels with Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), 
          venture capital and crowdfunding, the ways in which they are structured can be quite distinct from 
          existing forms of capital raising. 
          These distinctions, and rapid growth in the popularity of ICOs, are testinglat reorygu frameworks 
          around the world. The technology underpinning an ICO means that geographic borders are relatively 
          easily traversed and there is widespread anecdotal evidence to suggest that the organisers of ICOs 
          are choosing to issue from jurisdictions where regulatory settings are seen as most accommodatin g.
          A number of jurisdictions are actively competing to attract ICO activity and establish themselves as a 
          hub for innovative technology companies that favour ICO fundraising. 
          At the same time, regularsto in many jurisdictions have expressed significant concerns over the 
          potential risks posed by ICOs to consumers and investors. Reports of fraud and investor loss are 
          numerous and there is also anecdotal evidence that many ICOs have been conducted based o ann 
          often incorrect assumption that existing financial regulations do not apply. 
          This paper is intended to solicit the views of interested parties on: the opportunities and risks posed 
          by ICOs for Australia; whether our regulatory framework is well placed to allow those opportunities 
          to be harnessed whilst appropriately managing the associated risks; and, whether there are other 
          actions that could be taken to best position Australia to capitalise on new opportunities. 
          Definitions and token categories 
          While there is no widel-yadopted definition of an ICO, it typically involves the creation of digital 
          tokens by an issuer using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The tokens are acquired by investors 
          and potential consumers through online auction or subscrinp,t tio ypically in exchange for a 
          cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or for official fiat currency such as United States dollars. 
          In essence, tokens are a medium of exchange within a DLbTa-sed business venture, allowing token 
          holders the ability to earn value an/odr to spend their tokens on services that are internal to the 
          venture. While ICOs are often compared with crowdfunding, these two public online fundraising 
          methods differ in some important respects (refer to Box 1). 
                                                                      Page 1 
                    Initial Coin Offerings 
                    BOX 1: HOW DO ICOS DIFFER FROM CROWDFUNDING? 
                    Crowdfunding generally falls into two categoinvestrmiese: nonnt and- inv-basesetmd.ent 
                    Non-investment-based crowdfunding allows participants to make a donation to  support a cause or
                    pre-purchase a good or a service that will be made using the funds raised. Investment -based crowdfunding 
                    involves participants investing money for a financial reward or gain, and is known iia asn A  ustral
                    crowd-sourced equity fundraising (CSEF). The CSEF regime commenced in Septe m2017 fber                              or public 
                    companies, and was extended to include proprietary companies in October 2018.                 
                    While an ICO is essentially a means of crowdfunding a project that relies on DLT, there are some important 
                    differences compared with CSEF. 
                    Firstly, participants in an ICO typically exchange cryptocurrencies for a token that may or may not have rights 
                    attached. By contrast, in Australia the legislative framework governing crowd -sourced equity funding requires 
                    that official fiat currency be used to purchase an equity stake in the form of ordinary shares. 
                    Secondly, ICOs are an entirely decentralised method of fundraising and do not rely, as CSEF does, on 
                    intermediaries (or ‘platforms’) to facilitate the transaction.    
                    Thirdly, the way in which funds are raised in an ICO – via the issuance of digital tokens – can be intimately 
                    related to the success of the project. In general, for ICO projects to succeed, it is essential that many 
                    individuals create demand for the tokens to establish a customer base, more so than in CSEF projects. 
                    Further, CSEF guidelines set out expectations that issuers clearly articulate the intended use of funds and 
                    underlying business model, while there are no agreed standards for ICO ‘white papers’  (unless the tokens 
                    being issued fit the definition of a financial product, in which case the white paper must meet existing 
                                                                                    1
                    disclosure standards under the Corporations Act 2001) .  
                    Most CSEF projects are restricted to investors in a certain region or country that is native to where the project 
                    is developed, consistent with financial services or securities laws that generally require offers to comply with 
                    the laws of the country in which potential investors are located, rather than that of the project. By contrast, 
                    ICOs can potentially be offered to a much wider po olof potential investors and not generally constairned by 
                    geographic boundaries.  
                    Lastly, CSEF rules enforce strict caps to the maximum amount of funds raised, while ICOs are not subject to 
                    caps. ICO token issuers often release tokens in multiple phases, determining a cap for each stage of release. 
                     
                    Challenges in categorising ICO tokens 
                                                                                                                                  2
                    Digital tokens issued in an ICO, or crypto-tokens, generally have certain rights attached which grant 
                    to holders: 
                    •     the right to another digital currency (a ‘currency’ token, commonly referred to as a ‘stablecoin’); 
                    •     the right to a promised future cash flow linked to an underlying business or investment 
                          (an ‘equity’, ‘asset’ or ‘investment’ token); or 
                    •     the right to access a product or service provided by the issuer usually at some future point in 
                                                                     3
                          time (a ‘utility’ or ‘access’, token).  
                                                                               
                    1   Refer to Box 4 - Regulatory Treatment of ICOs in Australia. 
                    2   Some types of digital tokens confer no particular rights on those that purchase them f o–r example ‘community’, or 
                        ‘donation’ tokens –  and give subscribers the ability to fund a charitable venture or to establish lithink os wther 
                        subscribers (such as via a social network). 
                    3   A comparable list of token categories can be found in Zetzsche, Buckley, Arner and Fohr (2018).

                    Neatly defining and categorising digital tokens into one of the above types can be difficult for a 
                    number of reasons. Some tokens, for instance, confer on their holders a combination of rights sch u
                    as access to products and services, profit sharing and the ability to vote. Other tokens may evolve 
                    into another type of token as the project develops–  such as by starting as a token that represents a 
                    financial interest in the project and later used t pourchase a good or service available through the 
                    network on which it was created. In addition, the rapid pace at which the industry is developing 
                    means that new types of tokens are constantly being issued  a–nd these tokens may not fit neatly 
                    into the categories identified above. 
                    If a token has the characteristics of a financial produc tfo –r example, it confers rights to an equity 
                    stake in a business – it is often referred to as ‘security’ token in general discussion. It is important to 
                    note that a token may be a financial product even if it is described by another name, such as a utility 
                    token. As a result of the varied and dynamic nature of ICO tokens, and the fact that ICOs represent a 
                    new form of fundraising, it is difficult to make general and definitive statements on the application of 
                    existing regulatory frameworks to all ICOs. For example, while some digital tokens such as ‘equity’ 
                    tokens bear the hallmarks of a financial product, others such as utility tokens are more difficult to 
                    assess. This is discussed in more detail below (refer to ‘Regulation of IC OGlos -bal regulatory 
                    approaches and challenges’). 
                    KEY QUESTION 
                    1.1.    What is the clearest way to define ICOs and different categories of tokens? 
                     
                    Drivers of the ICO market 
                    Distributed ledger technology 
                    ICO activity has been facilitated by developments in DLT. Distributed ledgers are databases that are 
                    replicated and synchronised among multiple servers located in different site, seliminating the need 
                    for a central administrator. The unedrlying code and supporting infrastructure for this sharing and 
                    synchronising process is referred to as DL TT.his technology has a range of potential applications 
                    across the financial sector and more broadly. The popularity of D-bLaTsed projects has increased 
                    significantly since the development of blockchain, a type of DLT invented around 10 years ago with 
                    the launch of Bitcoin. More than a thousand ICOs have since launched, mostly using blockchain DLT 
                                                                           4
                    for the underlying platform and digital token.  
                    Digital token creators 
                    Entrepreneurial businesses wishing to create and sell digital tokens in order to raise funds have been 
                    attracted to the ICO model for a range of reasons. The freedom to structure an offering according to 
                    the individual preferences of the business has particularly high appeal for entrepreneurs wishing to 
                    retain full equity, and to businesses wanting to take advantage of growing consumer and investor 
                    interest surrounding digital tokens. ICO proponents also consider that digital token sales are assisting 
                    businesses to access credit more efficiently relative to venture capital. Digital token issuers have also 
                    benefited from the network effects inherent to the ICO fundraising model, and hightened interest 
                    surrounding digital tokens in recent years, which has fuelled speculation and market growth.

                Investor exuberance and speculation 
                There are a range of reasons why ICOs are perceived by some investors as an attractive alternative to 
                more traditional methods of investing. In particular, members of the public who are not sufficiently 
                large-scale to be angel or venture capital investorsc onsider ICOs to be a valuable opportunity to 
                purchase digital tokens in start-ups at an early stage, rather than wait for shares to be offered 
                through IPOs. While speculative investor behaviour has emerged as a key driver of the proliferation 
                of digital tokens, well-publicised losses and outright frauds have recentlyt empered some of this 
                optimism. 
                Digital token exchanges 
                The growth of digital token exchanges (and digital wallet providers) has facilitated digital token 
                trading. This has supported the growth of ICOs by providing liquidity for more popular tokens. Where 
                digital tokens are traded on an exchange, this makes it easier for investors to find tokens that they 
                are interested in buying. In addition to providing a marketplace for trading digital ts, dokiegnital 
                token exchanges may also create an opportunity for investors to crystallise any rise in the value of 
                                                              5
                their tokens or to exit a loss-making position.  
                KEY QUESTIONS 
                2.1    What is the effect and importance of secondary trading in the ICO market? 
                2.2    What will be the key drivers of the ICO market going forward? 
                 
                Opportunities and risks 
                This section looks at the potential benefits that businesses, consumers and the broader economy 
                could gain from emergence of ICOs as a funding source. It also look sth ae pt   ossible risks that ICOs 
                present. 
                Opportunities 
                For industry 
                The ICO fundraising model offers a number of potential advantages to businesses. An ICO may allow 
                businesses to raise funds by, in effect, issuing equity, accepting funds for management, or bringing 
                forward sales revenue. The money raised can then be spent on ea-rsltyage platform and product 
                development. This could enable the business to start up quickly and allow early-mover advantages in 
                                          6
                rapidly evolving markets.  
                                                  
                                                                           
                5   Digital currency exchanges that trade digital tokens that are classed as financial products need to hold a market licence 
                    in Australia. Currently, there are no such licenced platforms. Some digital token exchanges therefore appear to only 
                    trade a limited pool of digital currencies. 
                6   However, as the ICO market has evolved, the time involved in setting up and managing an ICO has been lengthening.

                    For ICOs that are not equity sales, the business is able to retain full equity ownership and control 
                    which is a significant motivating factor for some start-ups. In some cases, tokens issued may have no 
                    rights attached to them, and so the money received is effectively a donation. By remaining a private 
                    company, firms may also avoid incurring the costs typically ass ocpiatubelidc r weitphorting 
                    requirements. 
                    ICO tokens may be issued to a large number of small investors. Tapping into new investor groups 
                    creates an additional funding source for businesses, and may be an attractive option for s-tuartps 
                                                                                                                                 7
                                                                                                                                    For some 
                    that are not yet mature enough to access venture capital or to undertake an IPO.
                    Australian businesses, accessing new sources of capital has also allowed them to stay onshore rather 
                    than relocating overseas in search of capital. 
                    Creating a unique tokenallo  ws the business to retainm ore  control of its blockchain and its 
                    ecosystem, including by determining total supply. In addition, raising funds through a digital token 
                    offering may make the business’s product or service more attractive to consumers who are 
                    interested in crypto-related products and services. This can also create value through network 
                    effects,  by turning customesr into advocates and fostering a community that a isttached to the 
                    business brand from the time of launch. 
                    Finally, the functionality of digital tokens can allow for transactions on the businesses’ platform to 
                    take place without  requiring  the services of traditional payment and settlement intermediar ies
                    typically required for transactions involving fiat curre.  Inn cciesontrast with the way in which 
                    businesses typically transact across borders, a digital token enables a singular payments system that 
                    obviates the need to operate in multiple fiat currencies. 
                    For consumers and investors 
                    An ICO may allo windividual investors to gain exposure to a startupo r small business in the early 
                    stages of growth, and/or provide access to a product or service that they value D. epending on what 
                    is promised, the digital token received may allow consumers to earn bonus easnd discounts on a 
                    product or service, or function like a loyalty rewards program. In addition, compared with traditional 
                    venture capital where investors’ equity may be tied up for many years, equity in the form of a digital 
                    token may provide investors with more immediate liquidity where a secondary market exists for the 
                    tokens owned. 
                    While industry and media reports indicate that a large number of digital tokens lose value after the 
                    ICO, token-holders may benefit if the token’s value appreciates over time. Further, the digital tokens 
                    offered via ICOs may, over time, become a more accepted asset class in a diversified investment 
                    portfolio. 
                                                            
                                                                               
                    7   The RBA has noted that young small businesses continue to face challenges in accessing finance to fund expansion plans 
                        (RBA Quarterly Bulletin – December 2017). This is consistent wih at   2015 Productivity Commission Inquiry Report on 
                        Business Set-up, Transfer and Closure. The Productivity Commission found some evidence to suggest that innovative 
                        technology startup firms have not been well served by the Australian financial system. Iount fd that innovative new 
                        businesses do experience greater difficulty accessing finance than those that are not undertaking innovative activity and 
                        that the Australian venture capital market is relatively small scale and focussed on providing funding to companies with 
                        proven products and services or for later stage expansion. 
                                                                                                                                         Page 5 
        Initial Coin Offerings 
        In theory, an enterprise using DLT, such as through an ICO, has the potential to reduce counterparty 
        risk for consumers and investors by h-ardcoding rights into a ‘smart contract’ on the blockchain 
        (if any rights exist).  This may result in a technologically secure way of providing consumer and 
        investor protections. A smart contract is essentially an algorithm that executes an automatic transfer 
        of digital assets, money, or utility between parties when pr-edefined events occur, removing the 
        need for an intermediary to ensure the parties’ rights under the contract are fairly executed. 
        For the economy 
        A number of jurisdictions are actively competing to attract ICO activity and establish themselves as a 
        hub for innovative technologies that favour ICO fundraising. Industry proponents see ICOs as having 
        the potential to help fueli nnovation-driven economic growth, although it is too early to tell what 
        might be the long-run benefits. 
        It has been suggested that ICOs have become a significant source of funding for som-up e start
        projects. Future growth in ICO popularity could potentially create competition with traditional forms 
        of fundraising, generating greater efficiencies across the financial system. So long as the incentives 
        faced by fundraisers and investors are sufficiently aligned, ICOs could help to improve the efficiency 
        of capital allocation and contribute to economic growth. 
        Further, an ICO-friendly jurisdiction may attract ancillary services and this in turn may generate 
        positive flow-on effects for the wider economy. Examples of such services include digital t oken
        exchanges and wallet providers as well as legal and financial consulting services. In particular, it is 
        reasonable to expect that increased ICO activity would result in law and professional services firms 
        investing in these capabilities as well as new specialist firms entering the market. 
        Risks 
        For industry 
        A large number of ICOs have failed, and many have turned out to be scams or have raised money 
        illegally from public investors due to non-compliance with regulatory obligations. The resulting ‘wild 
        west’ notoriety of the ICO industry has challenged the reputation of some legitimate businesses, and 
        even technologies ,related to ICOs. Another key concern raised by businesses considering raising 
        funds via an ICO is the legal and regulatory risk due to uncertainty or unfamiliarity on the application 
        of the regulatory regime. 
        There is also a high degree of uncertainty as to how much money will be raised by an ICO. Given the 
        increasing  effort and cost involved in preparing for an ICO funding r,o ubnudsinesses may also 
        underestimate the upfront costs involved .There may also be challenges in valuing the business and 
        estimating the future financial needs of the business, given the volatility of token prices and that 
        digital tokens may be listed at different prices on various exchanges.

                      For consumers and investors 
                      Early generation ICOs attracted participation from investors who were technologically sophisticated 
                      and were likely to be familiar with the parties seeking to raise funds, and the underlying technology 
                      being used. As ICOs have become more popular, many newer investors do not or cannot undertake 
                      the due diligence required to have a full understanding of the risks involved with either the 
                      technology being used or the investment its elAfs. a result, risks to consumers are now being 
                                                                                                   8
                      highlighted by regulators through published statements.  
                      Financial risks to consumers can be particularly high; while data on ICO activity is incomplete, recent 
                      reports indicate that a significant proportion of ICOs fail or are fraudulent, with the number of 
                      successful ICOs are as low as 7 per cent in 2017 and the majority of financial gains accruing to private 
                                                                                                      9
                                                                                                        Depending on how an ICO is structured, 
                      parties who invested prior to the public ICO taking place.
                      the digital tokens offered under an ICO may fall outside the scope of existing financial regulation, in 
                      which case investors are not protec.t Fedurther, given the cro-bssorder nature of ICOs, legal 
                      protection and avenues for recourse may be limited, including if the tokens are ln ost or stole
                      (for example, via hacking or the loss of private access keys). 
                      Extreme volatility in the value of new digital tokens also exposes consumers to significant risk W. hile 
                      much of this volatility reflects inherent uncertainty over the true value of the token,s it may also be 
                      driven by instances of market manipulation. In a large proportion of cases, tokens will have been 
                      offered to private investors in a ‘presale,’ sometimes with significant discounts of up to 80 per cen.t 
                      Those initial investors may seek to create an undue level of hype surrounding the offering in order to 
                      sell their tokens at an artificially inflated initial trading price, before the value of the tokens decline 
                      markedly (so-called “pump and dump” schemes). 
                      In addition to the traditional financial risks of investing in early-stage start ups, retail investors in ICOs 
                      may find that the rights attached to digital tokens do not accord with their expectations or do not 
                      exist. ‘White papers’ are the typical disclosure document where ICO issuers detail mission 
                      statements, employee biographies and the technical specifics of a p  hroowjeecvt e–r these 
                      documents often lack detailed, consistent information and some contain fraudulent claims or 
                      plagiarised language. Misrepresentations made by token issuers over the specific rights attached to 
                      the tokens, or the prospect of significant potential or guaranteed returns, is an area that has 
                      potential to be of significant harm to consumers.

                      providers and cryptocurrency exchanges.10

                  Initial Coin Offerings 
                  For the economy 
                  While the advent of a new mechanism which could direct capital efficiently to innovative companies 
                  has the potential to deliver real economic gains, the realisation of those gains partly depends on the 
                  incentives faced by investors and those seeking to raise the capital. The exuberance surrounding ICOs 
                  has been evidenced by a rapid increase in the number of ICOs brought to market in a relatively short 
                  period of time, and in the volume of funds raised, with individual ICOs raising funds well in excess of 
                  expectations and often on the basis of scant, or at times fraudulent, information about the 
                  underlying company, its prospects and the rights of investors.11 
                  The historical record demonstrates that such signs of overexcitement can be associated with 
                  instances of speculative excess, fraud and capital misallocation. This can ultimately lead to lower 
                  returns on investment with deleterious impacts on overall econoicm growth. A large number of 
                  failed ICOs and instances of significant consumer and investor loss could als tarno ish views on DLT 
                  more generally and reduce people’s willingness to learn about and invest in its genuine economic 
                  potential.  Further, a larg-scalee  ICO failure may undermine investor trust and confidence in our 
                  regulatory system and harm Australia’s reputation for having a well-regulated financial sector. 
                  Emerging fund-sourcing mechanisms such as crowdfunding could also be undermined in the event of 
                  large-scale ICO failure, potentially resulting in negative investor sentiment towards n-otradn itional 
                  forms of fundraising. Such an outcome would be expected to limit new and existing businesses’ 
                  ability to capitalise on a full range of fundraising capabilities, hindering business growth. 
                  Although the ICO market is small relative to the broader economy, new digital tokens are being 
                  created at a rapid pace and, if current trends were to continue and tokens became widely adopted in 
                  mainstream society, this could ultimately create difficulties for macroeconomic management. Digital 
                  tokens, at least to date, have been subject to wide swings in value. Should individual and institutional 
                  investor exposure to digital tokens continue to grow, the financial stability implications of this 
                  volatility could become non-trivial. Further, much wider adoption of digital tokens as a means of 
                  payment could eventually present some challenges for monetary policy. 
                  KEY QUESTIONS 
                  3.1     How can ICOs contribute to innovation that is socially and economically valuable? 
                  3.2     What do ICOs offer that existing funding mechanisms do not? 
                  3.3     Are there other opportunities for consumers, industry or the economy that ICOs offer? 
                  3.4     How important are ICOs to Australia’s capability to being a global leader in FinTech? 
                  3.5     Are there other risks associated with ICOs to raise with policymakers and regulators? 
                   
                                                        
                                                                             
                  11  While the data on ICO activity is incomplete, there are some studies that attempt to quantify the funds raised by 
                      legitimate ICO campaigns. For example, Zetzsch eet al (2018) indicates that more funds were raised in ICOs the last 
                      six months of 2017 than in all previous 3.5 years. Zetzsche et al (2018) also indicates that many ICOs have been scams 
                      and Ponzi schemes, and others have had governance issues.

                Regulation of ICOs 
                Internationally, some countries are actively seeking to attract and develop a vibrant ICO market, 
                while others have banned cryp-ttooken activity entirely. Within Australia, ICOs are subject to 
                                                                                                            12  If  the

                tokens issued are classed as financial products, the ICO is subject to the Austrn Saliaecurities and 
                Investments Commission Act 2001 (ASIC Act). 
                Global regulatory approaches and challenges 
                In general, financial market regulators are taking various steps to clarify how existing laws apply to 
                crytopcurrency trading or issuanc, we    hile in t hcease of some smaller markets, new bespoke 
                frameworks have been created, often through targeted legislation .Aside from specific regulatory 
                approaches, the relative attractiveness of a jurisdiction as an ICO host may be influenced by tax 
                settings, the vibrancy of its local FinTech and startup ecosystem, and various other characteristics or 
                conventions of that country or state. 
                                                  13 and South Korea)14 have banned or actively sought to suppress 
                Some jurisdictions (such as China
                cryptocurrency trading or issuance (including ICOs). According to public statements ,regulators in 
                such jurisdictions are largely driven by concerns of fraudulent activity an  Ind t shceam ms.ost 
                extreme cases, the use, creation and sale of cryptocurrencies may be prohibited by law and 
                punishable by imprisonment. 
                Actions that may be taken to enforce a ban include banning banks from dealing with businesses 
                involved in exchanging or processing digital assets, blocking access to websites, the forced closure of 
                exchanges, and placing restrictions on search engines and social media platforms. However, there 
                are significant practical challenges in enforcing a complete ban, given the decentralised and global 
                nature of digital tokens. 
                Other regulatory responses have been to issue statements to warn cosnumers and investors of the 
                                                                                                                   15

           Initial Coin Offerings 
           Identifying when an ICO falls within financial services or securities 
           laws 
           One of the key challenges for market participants and regulators in accommodating ICOs within 
           existing frameworks has been determining when an ICO token is a “financial product” and thus falls 
           within relevant financial services and securities laws. Uncertainty of whether and how to comply with 
           financial services regulations appears to have constrained some jurisdictions’ digital token issuance. 
           If an ICO token is subject to financial services or securities laws, issuers are expected to comply with 
           specific obligations as they might apply to those undertaking an IPO, the sale of an options contract, 
           or the sale of units in a managed fund. This could require token issuers to prepare detailed disclosure 
           documents, complete independent audits, hold certain licences, submit specific reports to regulators 
           and comply with a range of financial market provisions. 
           There are some challenges in applying financial services and securities laws to 
           ICOs 
           Where a digital token grants the holder an equity interest, a right to an expected future cash flow, or 
           where its value is linked to the performance of a real or financial asset, it may be seevlf-ident that it 
           is a financial product. However, in many cases this determination is less straightforward. This can be 
           for a number of reasons, for example where the digital token performs multiple functions at different 
           times during the project life-cycle, or where there is a lack of detail surrounding a clearly defined 
           business plan about the digital token and its attached rights and obligations, the project or company 
           to which it is attached, or the broader features of the enterprise. 
           EXAMPLE: CRYPTOWALLABY 
           Consider the hypothetical company PouchTech, which aims to provide an online gaming plm caatforlled 
           CryptoWallaby where users can breed “digital wallabies”. The company markets its WBY tokens as a 
           ‘crypto-collectible’ exchangeable for game time on the site. PouchTech intends to sell WBY tokens through 
           an ICO fundraising campaign ahead of launch to help with development costs. PouchTech is not offering 
           any dividends, equity, or other financial return on WBY purchases, only the opportunity to play. The tokens 
           are not marketed as an investment product and so, on face value, WBY appears to be a utility token. 
           However, speculation around the potential success of CryptoWallaby may raise expectations about the 
           future value of WBY tokens, and incentivise purchases of WBY by investors who have no intention of using 
           the gaming platform, but instead plan to sell WBY at a higher price after the ICO is complete. These 
           investors expect to profit from PouchTech’s efforts to build the CryptoWallaby platform, but have no control 
           over the direction of the company or its projects. It appears that these speculators are engaging with WBY 
           as if it were a financial product. 
            
           To address the challenges in characterising certain digital tokens as a type of financial product, some 
           regulators have considered factors such as: how the token is marketed, including whether the 
           product is described as an investment opportunity; and whether the token is exchangeable for an 
           existing good or service, or if the platform is yet to be developed. 
           The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, has deemed that tkoens 
           are securities if they represent an investment in a common enterprise with an expectation that profit 
           will be derived from the efforts of others  -the so-called ‘Howey test’. Statements issued by the SEC 
           have been interpreted by industry as an indiiocant that ICO tokens will generally be treated as 
           securities (refer to Box 2).

                  BOX 2: REGULATORY APPROACH IN THE UNITED STATES 
                  While a number of federal and state regulators have jurisdiction in the area of cryptocurrency and ICOs in 
                  the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken the most prominent role in 
                  responding to the rising popularity of ICOs. On 25 July 2017, the SEC published an Investor Bulletin on 
                  ICOs as well as a Report of Investigation into an individual ICO that set out how fundamental principles of 
                  United States securities law may apply to ICOs. These two publications, followed by a public statement by 
                  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on 11 December 2017, outline the approach the SEC is currently taking to the 
                  regulation of ICOs. 
                  This approach centres on the premise that, depending on the facts and circumstances of the individual 
                  ICO, digital tokens may be securities and, if this is the case, the offer and sale of these digital tokens in an 
                  ICO are subject to the Securities Act 1933and      Securities Exchange Act of 1934(k nown collectively as 
                  ‘federal securities laws’). The SEC has outlined some general considerations for market professionals 
                  when determining whether a token offering represents an offering of securities: 
                  –  a change in the structure of a securities offerforing ( example,  where interests are recorded in a 
                     distributed, rather than central, ledger), does not change the fundamental requirement that when a 
                     security is being offered, the relevant securities law must be followed; 
                  –  merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token 
                     from being a security; and 
                  –  tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasise the potential for 
                     profits based on the efforts of others, and the ability to trade those tokens on a secondary market, are 
                     generally offerings of securities. 
                  Federal securities laws require registration with the SEC (unless an exemption is obtained). The purpose of 
                  this registration is to provide investors with procedural protections as well as material information, such as 
                  a prospectus, to help them make informed investment decisions. Additionally, trading platforms for 
                  securities are required to register as a national securitiesc exhange (unless an exemption is obtained). A 
                  number of enforcement orders have been issued by the SEC in the last 6 months against issuers of digital 
                                                                                                                         18
                  tokens solely for violations of the registration or exemption requirements of the federal securities law.  
                   
                  Some jurisdictions have made formal determinations of sub-categories of 
                  digital tokens 
                  Some international regulators may identify certain digital tokens as being subject to financial services 
                  and securities laws, and other digital tokens that are s  tou sbjeecptarate rules. For example, 
                  Switzerland’s financial market regulator defines three categories of tokens, including ‘payment 
                  tokens’ which provide access to a platform, and are therefore subject t-om aonnetiy laundering 
                  (AML) laws but not to securities laws (refer to Box 3).

               Policymakers in Malta have enacted a new set of laws that define various categories of tokens, 
               including ‘virtual financial assets’ which are subject to separate rules from financial products.19 
               Similarly, the Wyoming state government20  in the United States has implemented measures to 
               exempt utility tokens from certain financial services laws, so long as the tokens are exchangeable for 
                                                                 21 
               goods and services, and not marketed as investments.
               BOX 3: REGULATORY APPROACH IN SWITZERLAND 
               In September 2017, the Swiss Financial Market Regulator, FINMA, published guidance setting out the 
               applicability of existing laws for the regulation of ICOs, depending on their underlying purpose and specific 
               characteristics. Specifically, it outlined that ICOs may be subject to provisions relating to: money laundering 
               and terrorist financing; banking law; securities, and collective investment schemes legislation. 
               In February 2018, FINMA published further guidelines outlining how it will deal with enquiries regarding the 
               applicability of the existing supervisory and regulatory framework to ICOs. FINMA argues that setting out 
               these principles and providing tailored responses on a case-by-case basis provides clarity for market 
               participants. The guidance sets out the regulatory principles which FINMA will apply when responding to 
               enquiries from ICO issuers and the information FINMA requires from issuers in order to respond. Enquiries 
               are subject to a fee based on the time required to adequately respond. 
               The guidance also sought to provide clarity on how FINMA wilcl ategorise digital token offerings and how it 
               will treat those categories in a regulatory sense, albeit recognising that hybrid forms are possible: 
               –  Payment tokens: synonymous with cryptocurrencies and have no further functions or links to other 
                  development projects. Tokens may in some cases only develop the necessary functionality and become 
                  accepted as a means of payment over a period of time. FINMA will not treat payment tokens as 
                  securities, consistent with their current practice. However, payment tokens are still subject to the 
                  Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA). 
               –  Utility tokens: intended to provide digital access to an application or service, which do not qualify as 
                  securities only if their sole purpose is to confer digital access rights to an application or service and if 
                  the utility token can already be used in this way at the point of issue. Utility tokens are not subject to 
                  AMLA rules. If a utility token functions solely or partially as an investment in economic terms, FINMA 
                  will treat such tokens as securities (asset tokens). 
               –  Asset tokens: represent assets such as participations in real physical underlyings, companies, or 
                  earnings streams, or an entitlement to dividends or interest payments. In terms of their economic 
                  function, the tokens are analogous to equities, bonds or derivatives. As asset tokens are regarded as 
                  securities, there are securities law requirements for trading in such tokens, as well as civil law 
                  requirements under the Swiss Code of Obligations (for example, prospectus requirements).

               21  Separately, a Bill aimed at creating a specific regulatory framework for the issuance of digital tokens has been 
                  introduced to the United States Congress. TheB ill, in part, seeks to amend existing securities regulations to exclude 
                  digital tokens from the definition of a security and to direct the SEC to enact certain regulatory changes regarding digital 
                  units secured through public key cryptography. See UnitedS  tates Cong. House of Representatives. Token Taxonomy

               However, costs and benefits must be weighed 
               Anecdotal evidence suggests that while formal determinations of what regulatory obligations apply 
               to digital tokens has reduced uncertainty for some businesses, it has created a significant regulatory 
               burden. For example, some industry participants have reported that a determination from 
               Switzerland’s financial regulator can take up to six months. 
               Rather than distinguishing between financial product tokens and other types of digital tokens, some 
               jurisdictions apply frameworks that allow all ICO fundraising to take place outside of financial 
               services or securities laws. This means that tokens are sold without the disclosure and reporting 
               requirements that traditionally accompany a financial product, regardless of the token’s structure. 
               For example, the Isle of Man’s financial regulator has determined that tokens are not investments for 
               regulatory purposes and that virtual currency businesses are not subject to supervision or regulation 
                                                                    22 While this is a straightforward approach 
               by the regulator, other than compliance with AML laws.
               that provides certainty for digital token issuers, it may skew incentives towards ICO fundraising over 
               other forms in order to avoid regulation O. n the other hand, i tcould discourage some participants 
               that may consider unregulated ICOs highly risky compared to regulated forms of investment. 
               It should be noted that regulations in the consumers’ jurisdiction may apply even if the ICO is hosted 
               in a different jurisdiction. 
               Regulatory frameworks in Australia 
               The emergence of ICsO as a new mechanism for capital rais  has iningcreased interest in the 
               applicability of Australian financial services law to ICOs, and industry participants are seeking clarity 
               on when and how to apply financial product law. 
               Protection of consumers and investors 
               The  Australian Consumer Law  is the principal consumer protection law in Australia. It sets out 
               prohibitions that apply generally to all businesses that operate in Australia. These prohibitions cover 
               unfair contracts, unfair practices, unconscionable conduct and misleading or deceptive conduct. With 
               respect to financial products and services, similar protections are afforded by the Australian 
               Securities and Invstements Commission Act 2001 A(SIC Act). Consumer protection law for financial 
               products and services is supervised by ASIC, while consumer protection law fo-finr nanocnial 
               products is generally supervised by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). 
               The overarching policy intent of these provisions is to protect consumers and investors from 
               misleading and deceptive conduct, representations and practices across a broad range of consumer 
               and financial products and services. The prohibition against misleading and deceptive conduct is also 
               intended to influence norms for business conduct in the marketplace.

        Initial Coin Offerings 
        In the case of ICOs subject to consumer law (that is, not financial products), the ACCC has delegated 
        its powers to take action against misleading and deceptive conduct to the Australian Securities and 
        Investments Commission (ASIC). Consumer protection provisions apply to ICOs whether or not they 
        are financial products, consistent with the broad policy intent of the provisions. Feedbaocm k fr
        industry groups in Australia suggests that the application of consumer law to ICOs is currently 
        appropriate. 
        Regulation of financial products 
        Additional provisions apply to financial products and services as outlined in the Corporations Act 
        2001 (Corporations Act) which is administered by ASIC. These laws set out the compliance and 
        reporting obligations that companies have when they form, operate and cease and the obligations 
        applying to the provision of financial products and services. 
        A financial product under the Corporations Act includes a managed investment scheme (MIS), share 
        offering, derivative, or a non-cash payment facility (refer to Box 4, below). The Corporations Act can 
        require those that deal in such financial products to be licensed (subject to some exemptions) and to 
        comply with disclosure, registration and other obligations in relation to offering a financial product. 
        Box 4 also provides some general information on the obligations which may apply to issuers of 
        financial products. More detailed information on when an ICO token might be a financial product and 
        the obligations which may apply can be found in ASIC guidance: Information Sheet 225.23 
        BOX 4: REGULATORY TREATMENT OF ICOS IN AUSTRALIA 
        The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published updated guidance (Information 
        Sheet 225) on the regulatory treatment of ICOs in Australia in May 2018, and will be further updated in 
        Q1 2019. The particular law that applies rests on whether the ICO token is a financial product. If the ICO 
        token is a financial product, consumers are protected by the relevant provisions for those financial products 
        under the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act). 
        Alternatively, if the ICO is not a financial product, ICO issuers are still subject to general law and the 
        misleading and deceptive conduct prohibitions under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) 
        Schedule 2 (Australian Consumer Law). ASIC has received a delegation of power from the Australian 
        Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) that enables it to take action under the Australian 
        Consumer Law relating to ICOs if required. Australian law can also apply to an overseas entity that issues 
        financial products to Australian investors. 
        Information Sheet 225 provides guidance for potential issuers to assist with determining whether an ICO 
        token is likely to be a financial product, and thus subject to the relevant provisions of the Corporations Act, 
        based on the attributes of some typical forms of offering. Specifically, a digital token that is a financial 
        product could be a: 
        –  Managed investment scheme: The digital tokens issued under an ICO may constitute an interest in a 
          managed investment scheme, if investors contribute money or money’s worth and those contributions 
          are pooled or used in common enterprise to produce financial benefits or interests in property but where 
          investors do not have day to day control but may have voting rights (see s9 of the Corporations Act). 
          ICO issuers must comply with Chapter 5C and 7 of the Corporations Act.

                           BOX 4: REGULATORY TREATMENT OF ICOS IN AUSTRALIA (CONTINUED) 
                                 :    ASIC has released a suite of regulatory guides to provide comprehensive guidance to the industry. 
                                      These regulatory guides provide advice on a range of issues related to establishing and running a 
                                      management investment scheme. In particular, they detensaiilng, li rc egistration and product 
                                      disclosure obligations for issuers and operators of a managed investment scheme. 
                           –  Share offering if the rights attached to the digital token are similar to rights commonly attached to a 
                                 share. These include ownership, voting rights or some right to participate in the profits of the issuer. 
                                 :    Where it appears that an issuer of an ICO is actually making a public offer of a share, the issuer will 
                                      need to prepare a prospectus. Such offers of shares are often described as initial public offerings 
                                      (IPOs). By law, a prospectus must contain all information that consumers reasonably require to 
                                      make an informed investment decision.24 
                           –  Derivative offering if the price of the digital token is based on, for example, another financial product, 
                                 underlying market index or asset price moving in a certain direction before a time or event, which in turn 
                                 triggered a payment under the rights or obligations of the digital token. 
                                 :    A derivative offering requires a product disclosure statement that contai snsufficient information so 
                                                                                                                                                                                                    25
                                      that a retail client may make an informed decision about whether to purchase the financial product.  
                                      The product disclosure must contain detail such as: fees payable, risks and benefits and significant 
                                      characteristics of the derivative offered. 
                           –  Non-cash payment facility if there is an arrangement where the digital token may be used to make 
                                 payments to a number of payees or for payments to begin in the form of the digital token and be 
                                 converted to fiat currency to complete the payment. 
                                 :    Many non-cash payment facilities are regulated as financial products under the Corporations,  Act
                                      and issuers must comply with the licensing, conduct and disclosure requirements for financial 
                                                                                                                                                                                      26
                                      services. ASIC has provided some exemptions for classes of non-cash payment facilities.  Some of 
                                      these exemptions contain conditions – for example issuers may be required to prominently display 
                                      any expiry date and any rights the issuer retains to unilaterally change the terms and conditions of 
                                      the facility. 
                           In addition to the regulation of digital tokens at the initial offering stage, regulations also apply to the 
                           secondary market trading of digital tokens. Operators that offer the ability to trade digital tokens may be 
                           operating a 'financial market' as defined under the Corporations Act, if their platform enables customer to s
                           buy, be issued or sell these tokens. Anyone who operates a financial market in Australia is required by law 
                           to obtain a licence to do so or otherwise be exempted.27 
                           Obligations under ant-moneyi   laundering and count-tererrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws for digital 
                           currency exchanges came into effect on 3 April 2018, including requirements for exchanges to identify and 
                           verify their customers and consider the risk posed by each customer, and to report certain transactions to 
                           the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).

                  Initial Coin Offerings 
                  Industry-led initiatives 
                  In addition to formal regulation, the industry has a collective role in establishing minimum standards 
                  and raising governance levels in order to foster consumer and investor confidence. One prominent 
                  international example is the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) project, which was formed 
                  with the aim of developing an industry standard for digital token sales that are compliant with 
                  regulatory frameworks in the US and elsewhere. Similarly, a Code of Conduct has been developed by 
                  an industry body for digital finance, Global Digital Finance, setting out principles for token issuance 
                  and other cryptoasset activities. 
                  While industry-led initiatives can play a role, many in the industry believe that an appropriate level of 
                  regulation is welcome and that self-regulation alone is not an optimal path forward. It has been noted 
                  that where government and regulators are clear on how legal frameworks apply to ICOs, and are willing 
                  to accommodate innovation, this provides certainty and contributes positively to development of the 
                  industry, particularly given the ‘wild west’ notoriety the sector has gained in its infancy . 
                  New regulatory frameworks 
                  Some industry participants have suggested that a new regulatory framework, separate from current 
                  financial services law, would best support the development of an ICO market in Australia. A recent 
                  comparable example is the Corporations Amendment (Crowsodu-rced Funding) Act 2, w017hich 
                  established a new legislative framework for fundraising via crowdsource platforms. Such bokee sp
                  frameworks have the potential to provide clarity of the application of relevant laws and regulations 
                  and encourage economic activity. 
                  However, the costs of introducing a new regulatory regime must be weighed against any potential 
                  benefits, particularly if the existing regime may be generally sufficient or where other measures 
                  could be taken to achieve policy goals. Disadvantages could include adding unnecessary legislative 
                  complexity and stifling future innovation by locking in particular ICO models. In addition, there can be 
                  a significant lead time involved in setting up a new legislative framework, and this should be taken 
                  into account given the rapid pace of change in ICO and DLT-based businesses. 
                  Some adjustments to the current regime could be considered in order to provide more regulatory 
                  certainty and remove any impediments to legitimate ICO fundraising. For example, an area where 
                  more certainty might be beneficial is the distinction between securit aynd utility tokens, and the 
                  associated application of consumer and financial services laws. Such clarity could potentially be 
                  provided through further regulatory guidance, or via legislative change. 
                  KEY QUESTIONS 
                  4.1     Is there ICO activity that may be outside the current regulatory framework for financial products and 
                          services that should be brought inside? 
                  4.2     Do current regulatory frameworks enable ICOs and the creation of a legitimate ICO market? If not, 
                          why and how could the regulatory framework be changed to support the ICO market? 
                  4.3     What, if any, adjustments to the existing regulatory frameworks would better address the risks posed 
                          by ICOs? 
                  4.4     What role could a code of conduct play in building confidence in the ICO industry? Should any such 
                          code of conduct be subject to regulator approval? 
                  4.5     Are there other measures that could be taken to promote a well-functioning ICO market in Australia?

                Tax treatment of ICOs 
                The current tax treatment of ICOs follows from the attributes of the tokens that are issued. This tax 
                treatment is consistent with taxation of other commercial transactions, financial instruments and 
                capital raising mechanisms, where the tax implications flow from the underlying nature of the rights 
                and obligations attached to the instrument, and not the form in which the instrument is issued. 
                For example some ICOs offer tokens with equ-ilityke characteristics in the form of voting rights or 
                profit participation, while other ICOs offer tokens that give rights to the future use of a DLT platform. 
                As a result, how proceeds from ICOs are taxed in the hands of the issuer will depend on a number of 
                factors, including whether they are issued in the form of a managed investment scheme, an offer of 
                shares or other forms of equity, an offer of a derivative, or non-cash payment facility (potentially for 
                future services to be provided by the issuer), in the same way as any other transaction or event. 
                Tax law contains tests to determine whether a particular interest is a debt interest or an equity 
                interest (or neither) for tax purposes .These ‘debt and equity tests ’may impact the tax treatment of 
                the proceeds of the ICO (both in the hands of the issuer and the investor), including whether a return 
                on an interest in an entity may be frankable and n-deodnuctible to the issuer (like a dividend), or 
                whether it may be deductible to the issuer and not frankable (like interest). 
                Tax implications for issuers 
                Given the variety in how these arrangements can be structured, there is no single manner in which 
                ICO proceeds are taxed. The following no-exhn  austive list of scenarios outlines a range of possible 
                tax outcomes: 
                •    Where the tokens are issued in respect of a debt or equity instrument, the issue proceeds may 
                     not be assessable up front to the issuer. 
                •    Where the tokens are issued in respect of a prepayment for s aervice, the issue proceeds are 
                     likely to be assessable to the issuer. 
                •    If the issuer of the tokens makes regular transactions in tokens, it is possible that the proceeds 
                     could be seen as forming part of some trading activity such that the ICO proceeds could be taxed 
                     as ordinary income. 
                •    Proceeds from tokens that are issued as an offer of a derivative could be subject to tax under 
                     the taxation of financial arrangement rules. 
                Tax implications for token holders 
                For the token buyer or recipient, tokens acquire dthrough an ICO are considered an asset for tax 
                purposes, and any capital gains arising may be subject to capital gains tax (GST A).lternatively, gains 
                can be taxed as ordinary income, depending on the purpose of the acquisition. 
                Tokens that are acquired and used solely for the purchase of goods and services for personal use or 
                consumption may be considered a personal use asset. Capital gains on personal use assets acquired 
                for less than $10,000 are disregarded for tax purposes. All capital losses made on personal use assets 
                are disregarded. 
                                                                                                             Page 17 
                     Initial Coin Offerings 
                     Like other assets within the CGT regime, a token is considered to be disposed when it is sold, traded 
                     or exchanged. For example, this can include converting cryptocurrency to a fiat currency such as 
                     Australian dollars,  using it to obtain goods and services or exchanging one cryptonccuyr freor 
                     another cryptocurrency. 
                     There may also be tax consequences that arise in relation to returns or flows of value that may be 
                     received by taxpayers who hold tokens acquired through an ICO. The tax treatment will depend on 
                     the nature of the returns (that is, whether the returns have characteristics similar to dividends, 
                     interest or income), and the purpose of the holder in acquiring the tokens. 
                     GST treatment of digital tokens 
                     The GST treatment of sales and purchases of tokens as part of an ICO primarily depends on whether 
                     it meets the definition of a digital currency, a security or something else. Generally speaking, if the 
                     token is: 
                     •     a digital currency, it is treated the same way as mneoy, and no GST will apply to sales of the 
                           token; 
                     •     a security (for example, it is a share, derivative or managed investment scheme), no GST will 
                           apply to sales of the token; or 
                     •     neither a digital currency nor a security, GST may apply to sales of tOheth ter oken. 
                           circumstances, including whether the parties are, or are required to be, registered for GST, will 
                           determine the GST treatment. 
                     Further information on the tax treatment of ICOs is set out in Appendix A.

           ATTACHMENT A: TAX TREATMENT OF DIGITAL TOKENS 
           Income tax treatment for investors 
           This section considers the tax treatment applying to cryptocurrency (or tokens) that may be issued as 
           part of an ICO to individual investors. 
           This tax treatment is not specific to ICOs, but applies generally to the acquisition and disposal of 
           cryptocurrency, and may differ depending on the cryptocurrency’s characteristics and use. There 
           may also be tax consequences that arise in relation to returns or flows of value that may be received 
           by taxpayers who hold tokens that have been acquired through an ICO. The tax treatment in these 
           circumstances will depend on the nature of the returns (for example, whether they have 
           characteristics similar to dividends, interest or income), and the purpose of the holder in acquiring 
           the tokens. 
           Cryptocurrency acquired as an investment 
           In general, cryptocurrency (including when acquired through an ICO as a coin or token) is considered 
           an asset for tax purposes, and any capital gains arising may be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) at 
           marginal tax rates on disposal. Cryptocurrency is considered to be disposed when it is sold, traded or 
           exchanged. For example, this can include converting cryptocurrency to a fiat cuyr srenucch as 
           Australian dollars, using it to obtain goods and services or exchanging one cryptocurrency for 
           another cryptocurrency. 
           If a capital gain is made on disposal, the 50 per cent CGT discount may apply to capital gains on 
           cryptocurrency held for a period of 12 months or longer. The CGT discount means that any capital 
           gains made on disposal of cryptocurrency (after offsetting any capital losses, including any net capital 
           losses from previous years) are reduced by 50 per cent, so that tax is only paid  bthye individual at 
           marginal rates on the balance. 
           EXAMPLE: CRYPTOCURRENCY INVESTMENT 
           Terry is interested in an investment opportunity in a sm-up tall shattar it s seeking to create a new 
           cryptocurrency. The terms of the initial coin offering state that for a $100 investment, the investor will 
           receive a token which represents a right to one of the new digital coins when the new blockchain is 
           operational. Terry considers that it may be quite lucrative to move into this space early before others follow 
           so he invests $1,000 and receives 10 tokens which he has added to his investment portfolio. 
           If Terry sells any of these tokens, or waits until the blockchain is operational and sells the cryptocurrency, 
           the proceeds would be subject to CGT. He has acquired and held his cryptocurrency as an investment. 
            
           Cryptocurrency acquired through a chain split 
           Cryptocurrencies may undergo what is often known as a ‘fork’, or what we refer to in this appendix 
           as a chain split. A chain split occurs when the blockchain for a cryptocurrency diverges into 
           two paths, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency and associated blockchain. The creation 
           of Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin is an example of a chain split. 
           Page 20 
                                                                                                        Initial Coin Offerings 
                 A chain split may result in holders of cryptocurrency receiving a new cryptocurrency. This new 
                 cryptocurrency is in addition to their existing holdings of cryptocurrency, and is a direct result of the 
                 chain split. If individuals hold cryptocurrency as an investment and receive a new cryptocurrency as a 
                 result of a chain split, they will not derive ordinary income or make a capital gain at the time they 
                 receive the new cryptocurrency. However, they will make a capital gain when they dispose of the 
                 new cryptocurrency. For the purposes of working out the capital gain, the cost base of the new 
                 cryptocurrency received is zero. 
                 If the new cryptocurrency is held as an investment for 12 months or more, individuals may be 
                 entitled to receive the 50 per cent CGT discount. 
                 EXAMPLE: BITCOIN IS SPLIT INTO BITCOIN CASH 
                 Alex held 10 Bitcoin on 1 August 2017 as an investment, when Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin. Immediately 
                 after the chain split, Alex held 10 Bitcoin and 10 Bitcoin Cash. Alex does not derive ordinary income or 
                 make a capital gain as a result of the receipt. 
                 On 25 May 2019, Alex sold the 10 Bitcoin Cash for $4,000. Because the cost base of the Bitcoin Cash was 
                 zero, Alex makes a total capital gain of $4000 in the 201819 incom-  e year from the sale of the Bitcoin 
                 Cash. 
                 As Alex held the Bitcoin Cash for more than 12 months, the CGT discount can be applied in calculating 
                 Alex’s net capital gain. Assuming Alex had no capital losses available to be offset in the 2018-19 income 
                 year, or any net capital losses from previous income years, the net capital gain from the sale of the Bitcoin 
                 Cash would be $2,000. 
                  
                 Cryptocurrency held as a personal use asset 
                 Cryptocurrency that is acquired and used solely for the purchase of goods and services for personal 
                 use or consumption may be considered a personal use asset. Capitals gains on personal use assets 
                 acquired for less than $10,000 are disregarded for tax purposes. However, all capital losses made on 
                 personal use assets are disregarded. 
                 EXAMPLE: CRYPTOCURRENCY AS A PERSONAL USE ASSET 
                 Brian’s local café offers discounts to clients who purchase their meals using Bitcoin. Brian purchases an 
                 amount of Bitcoin ($250) to pay fsor w hieekly dinner at the café and uses the purchased Bitcoin 
                 accordingly. In this circumstance, because Brian acquired and used the cryptocurrency for the purpose of 
                 dining out at the café, the cryptocurrency is a personal use asset. As the cost ofthe  acquiring 
                 cryptocurrency was less than $10,000, any capital gain Brian made on the disposal of the cryptocurrency 
                 would be disregarded. 
                  
                 Income tax treatment for issuers 
                 This section considers the current tax treatment applying to cryptocurrency (or tokens) that may be 
                 issued as part of an ICO from the issuer’s perspective .The tax treatment would ordinarily follow the 
                 attributes of the offering. For example, ICOs could be undertaken in the form of a managed 
                 investment scheme, in the form of an offer of shsare, offer of a derivative, or no-cnash payment 
                 facility (potentially for future services to be provided by the issuer). 
                                                                                                                   Page 21 
                     Initial Coin Offerings 
                     Just like any other transaction or event, the existing tax rules will apply to ICO arrangements. The tax 
                     treatment of the ICO will depend on how the ICO is structured and operated, the characteristics of 
                     the token, products and/or services being offered and the rights and obligations between the parties. 
                     Factors potentially impacting the tax treatment can include whether there are voting rghi ts, rights to 
                     share in profits, rights to receive certain products or services, or a right to repayment of the 
                     investment. As such, there is not a single tax outcome that will apply to all ICOs. 
                     Tokens economically equivalent to debt or equity interests 
                     The tax law contains tests to determine whether a particular interest is a debt interest or an equity 
                     interest (or neither) for tax purposes. These ‘debt and equity tests’ may impact on the tax treatment 
                     of the proceeds of the ICO (both in the hands of t hisesuer and the holder), including whether a 
                     return on an interest in an entity may be frankable and non-deductible to the issuer (like a dividend), 
                     or whether it may be deductible to the issuer and not frankable (like interest). 
                     Broadly, in order for an interest to be classified as an equity interest, the interest must carry a return 
                     that is contingent on the economic performance of the issuer. Conversely, if the interest carries an 
                     obligation that the issuer is required to return to the holder an amount at least equal to the amount 
                     invested, then the interest may be treated as a debt interest. 
                     Treatment as capital or trading stock, and other considerations 
                     In certain circumstances, the proceeds could form the principal of a debt or equity interest (and no  t
                     taxed upon receipt), whereas in other circumstances tax will be payable upfront on the proceeds of 
                     the ICO if the proceeds are ordinary income. 
                     If the issuer of the tokens makes regular transactions in tokens, it is possible that the proceeds could 
                     be seen as forming part of some trading activity such that the ICO proceeds could be taxed as 
                     ordinary income. 
                     Depending on the attributes of the arrangement, other tax consequences may arise for the issuer of 
                     the tokens, for example: 
                     •     Where the tokens are issued in respect of a prepayment for a service, the issue proceeds are 
                           likely to be assessable to the issuer. 
                     •     Proceeds from tokens that are issued as an offer of a derivative could be subject to tax under 
                           the taxation of financial arrangement rules and may form part of the cost base of the financial 
                           arrangement. 
                     •     Where the tokens are issued to employees of the issuer in relation to their employment, those 
                           tokens may constitute to be a benefit that could be subject to the fringe benefit tax provisions. 
                     Given the variety in how these arrangements can be structured, there is no single manner in which 
                     ICO proceeds are taxed.

                     EXAMPLE: TOKENS ISSUED FROM AN ICO ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO AN 
                     EQUITY INTEREST 
                     ABC co undertakes an ICO to raise capital and issues tokens to nviestors. ABC co prepares and releases 
                     a prospectus document inviting investors to invest in the ICO. The prospectus document contains all 
                     information that consumers reasonably require, under the law, to make an informed investment decision. 
                     There are certain rights attached to the tokens issued by ABC co. The rights attached to the tokens are 
                     similar to the rights commonly attached to a share, that is, voting rights in decisions of the company, right 
                     to participate in profits of the company and a claim on the residual assets of the company if it is wound up. 
                     In these circumstances, such a capital raising may create equity interests in the company, and the tax 
                     treatment of the ICO would follow that of an IPO (that is, the receipts would not be taxable to the issuer). 
                     Alternatively, if ABC co makes regular transactions in tokens as part of its business, then those proceeds 
                     received from tokens issued as part of an ICO could be treated as ordinary income and taxed upfront. 
                      
                     GST on sales of cryptocurrency 
                     The GST treatment of sales and purchases of cryptocurrency as part of an ICO primarily depends on 
                     whether it meets the definition of a digital currency, a security or something else. Whether parties 
                     are registered for GST, or are required to register for GST, will also affect the GST treatment. 
                     Generally speaking, if the cryptocurrency is: 
                     •     a digital currency, it is treated the same way as money, and no GST will apply to sales of the 
                           cryptocurrency; 
                     •     a security (for example, it is a share, derivative or manedag investment scheme), no GST will 
                           apply to sales of the cryptocurrency; or 
                     •     neither a digital currency nor a security, GST may apply to sales of the cryptocurrency. Other 
                           circumstances, including whether the parties are, or are required to be, registered for GST, will 
                           determine the GST treatment. 
                     EXAMPLE: PURCHASE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY 
                     Joel, an Australian consumer, acquires 200 Koalacoins (a cryptocurrency) from Koalaco, an Australian 
                     resident company that is registered for GST, paying in Australian dollars. 
                     The sale of the Koalacoins by Koalaco to Joel is a supply of digital currency for money meani – ng, the 
                     supply would be an input taxed financial supply. As such, no GST will apply. Specifically, Koalaco cannot 
                     charge GST on the supply, and generally cannot cail m any GST credits on costs incurred in relation to that 
                     supply. 
                     As Joel is neither registered nor required to be registered for GST, there are no GST consequences for 
                     him.
