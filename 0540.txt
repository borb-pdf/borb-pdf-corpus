    Additional information:  
     
     1. For all other invoices where a hardcopy is required to be mailed to Google, please refer to the ‘Mail to’ 
       address on your PO.  
     
     2. Invoices for POs with a ‘Bill to’ address in countries where electronic invoice submission is permitted 
       should be submitted in PDF format online: ​https://gist-uploadmyinvoice.appspot.com/.​ If invoices are 
       submitted electronically please DO NOT also send in a hardcopy invoice as this will delay payment 
       processing.  
        
     3. Argentina invoices:​ If the invoice ​has a C.A.I. number or none: Vendor​ to submit invoice in hardcopy 
       to the address on the PO. If the invoice ​has a C.A.E. number: Vendor​ to submit invoice electronically 
       via p2phelp@google.com 
        
     4. Chile invoices:​ Vendors are allowed to submit electronically to ​facturasdataluna@cl.pwc.com 
       (Dataluna) or ​facturasloboflores@cl.pwc.com​ (Loboflores) provided that: 
     
         ● Local Suppliers need to be registered in the local Tax Authority  
         ● Invoice needs to have the legend: FACTURA ELECTRONICA in the invoice with a correlative 
          number and with the RUT of the Supplier, example: 
           
                             
     
     5. Mexico invoices:​ The Mexico ​SAT​ ​mandates some suppliers to submit a valid XML file along with their 
       invoice. If you are​ ​required​ ​to submit XML, your invoice will only be processed if we receive a valid XML 
       file along with a PDF copy invoice to p2phelp@google.com. All other suppliers should send paper copy 
       invoices to the submit-to address listed on the PO.  
     
     6. Turkey invoices:​ The Turkish authorities require suppliers that are registered with the TRA to submit 
       invoices through the TRA portal. If the supplier is not registered it still needs to send the hardcopy 
       invoice to: 
     
          Attn: Accounts Payable 
          Iron Mountain Slovakia s.r.o.  
          Na Pántoch 18  
          LC Rača  
          831 06 Bratislava  
          Slovakia  
        
     7. Brazil invoices:​ we accept electronic invoices (Nota Fiscal) via email to ​p2phelp@google.com​, the 
       sender must include:  
         ● Invoice file (PDF format). Include PO number on invoice. 
         ● XML file (if goods invoice) 
         ● If PO is not indicated on the invoice, include it as PDF. 
         ● Subject of the email must begin with: “Google Brazil - Soft Copy - Invoice”, example: “Google 
          Brazil - Soft Copy - Invoice 1234”. This subject title should only be used for invoice submission. 
     
       If the invoice is not originally electronic (hand written invoice) then it should be submitted in hardcopy. 
       Invoices for Brazil can not be submitted via the submission online portal.
