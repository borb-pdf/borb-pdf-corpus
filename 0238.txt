                     1.    INTRODUCTION 
                    1.1    Objectives 
                    The primary purpose of the rules governing medicinal products is to safeguard public 
                    health. However, this objective must be achieved by means which do not hinder the 
                    development of the pharmaceutical industry or trade in medicinal products within the 
                    Union. Thus, the pharmaceutical legislation of the European Union has consistently 
                    pursued the twin objectives: the protection of public health and the free movement of 
                    medicinal products. 
                    General principles of the Union pharmaceutical legislation are given in this chapter. 
                    More  detailed  explanations  concerning  the  different  procedures  for  marketing 
                    authorisation are provided in Chapters 2 - 6. 
                    1.2    Status 
                    This  Notice  to  Applicants  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Article  6  of 
                    Regulation  (EC)  No  726/20041  and  Annex  I  of  Directive  2001/83/EC2  on  the 
                    Community code relating  to  medicinal  products  for  human  use.  It  is  intended  to 
                    facilitate the interpretation and application of the Union pharmaceutical legislation. It 
                    is  not  legally  binding  and,  in  case  of  doubt,  reference  should  be  made  to  the 
                    appropriate Union Directives and Regulations. It is important when reading this text 
                    to appreciate that the legal requirements of the Union pharmaceutical legislation must 
                    be  met  and  that  this  Notice  to  Applicants  represents  the  harmonised  view  of  the 
                    Member  States,  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  and  the  Commission 
                    services on how those requirements may be met. 
                    Guidelines and other interpretative documents to which references are included within 
                    this document represent the views of their authors.  
                    References  throughout  the  Notice  to  Applicants  to  provisions  of  Directive 
                    2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 must be read as references to the directive 
                    and the regulation as last amended3, unless it is otherwise expressly stated.

                     2.    MARKETING AUTHORISATION 
                    A medicinal product may only be placed on the market in the European Economic 
                    Area  (EEA)  when  a  marketing  authorisation  has  been  issued  by  the  competent 
                    authority of a Member State for its own territory (national authorisation) or when an 
                    authorisation has been granted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for 
                    the entire Union (an  Union authorisation). The marketing authorisation holder must 
                    be established within the EEA. 
                    Article 54 of the Treaty of the functioning of the European Union (Chapter 2 Right of 
                    establishment) reads:  
                         ‘Companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member State and 
                         having  their  registered  office,  central  administration  or  principal  place  of 
                         business within the Union must, for the purposes of this Chapter, be treated in 
                         the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States.  
                         “Companies  or  firms”  means  companies  or  firms  constituted  under  civil  or 
                         commercial  law,  including  co-operative  societies,  and  other  legal  persons 
                         governed by public or private law, save for those which are non-profit-making’.  
                    For  the  purpose  of  applying  this  definition  in  the  context  of  the  pharmaceutical 
                    legislation  it  should  be  clarified  that  ‘non  profit-making’  organisations  can  be 
                    marketing authorisation holders. 
                    A  marketing  authorisation  lays  down  the  terms  under  which  the  marketing  of  a 
                    medicinal product is authorised in the EU. A marketing authorisation is composed of: 
                           (i)  a  decision  granting  the  marketing  authorisation  issued  by  the  relevant 
                           authority; and 
                           (ii) a technical dossier with the data submitted by the applicant in accordance 
                           with Articles 8(3) to 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC and Annex I thereto, Articles 
                           6(2) and 31(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, or Article 7 of Regulation 
                           (EC) No 1394/2007. 
                     
                    European Economic Area (EEA) 
                    Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein form the EEA with the 28 Member States of the 
                    European  Union.  These  countries  have,  through  the  EEA  agreement,  adopted  the 
                    complete Union acquis on medicinal products and are consequently parties to the 
                    Union procedures. Where in this chapter reference is made to Member States of the 
                    Union this should be read to include  Norway,  Iceland  and  Liechtenstein.  Legally 
                    binding acts from the Union (e.g. Commission decisions) do not directly confer rights 
                    and obligations but have first to be transposed into legally binding acts in Norway, 
                    Iceland  and  Liechtenstein.  According  to  Decision  N°  74/1999  of  the  EEA  Joint 
                    Committee when decisions on approval of medicinal products are taken by the Union, 
                    Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein will take corresponding decisions on the basis of 
                    relevant  acts.  Consequently,  these  States  are  concerned  with  the  single  European 
                    market for medicinal products. Therefore, where in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 
                    726/2004 and Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC, reference is made to the applicant 
                                                               4 
                                                                 
             
            being  established  in  the  Union,  this  is  extended  to  include  Norway,  Iceland  and 
            Liechtenstein. 
            The  marketing  authorisations  granted  by  Norway,  Iceland  and  Liechtenstein  are 
            eligible  for  the  mutual  recognition  procedure  in  the  same  way  as  the  marketing 
            authorisations granted by Member States.  
            Liechtenstein 
                                    4
            Since  1st  December  2010  the  treaty   between  Liechtenstein  and  Austria  about 
            automatic  recognition  of  the  Marketing  Authorisations  granted  via  Mutual 
            Recognition Procedure (MRP) or Decentralised Procedure (DCP) is operational. This 
            allows Liechtenstein to use Marketing Authorisations granted by Austria provided the 
            applicants have identified Liechtenstein as CMS in the application form submitted 
            with  MRP or DCP applications. At the end of the procedures, Austria will grant 
            authorisations that will be recognised by Liechtenstein. This marketing authorisation 
            can  be  considered  as  a  marketing  authorisation  granted  in  accordance  with  the 
            pharmaceutical  acquis  for  the  purpose  of  EU  legislation  and  in  particular  can  be 
            considered as a starting point for the purposes of data exclusivity/market protection in 
            the EU.  
            Further,  in  application  of  a  bilateral  agreement5  between  Switzerland  and 
            Liechtenstein,  a  Swiss  marketing  authorisation  is  automatically  effective  in 
            Liechtenstein.  This recognition has no effects outside the customs union between 
            Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Consequently a marketing authorisation granted by the 
            Swiss authorities and recognised by Liechtenstein, while Switzerland does not apply 
            the  EU  pharmaceutical  acquis,  cannot  be  considered  as  a  marketing  authorisation 
            granted  in  accordance  with  the  pharmaceutical  acquis  for  the  purpose  of  EU 
            legislation and in particular cannot be considered as a starting point for the purposes 
            of data exclusivity/market protection in the EU (see part 6 on data exclusivity/market 
            protection).  
            Monaco  
            An agreement between the Union and the Principality of Monaco entered into force 
            on 1 May 2004, Council Decision 2003/885/EC of 17 November 2003 concerning the 
            conclusion of the Agreement on the application of certain Community acts on the 
            territory of the Principality of Monaco6. On the basis of this agreement and the special 
            arrangements agreed between France and the Principality of Monaco in an agreement 
            of 6 January 2003, the French authorities assume the role of competent authorities as 
            far as the application of the medicinal products legislation to products manufactured 
            in  Monaco  is  concerned.  The  French  authorities  are  responsible  for  the  issue  of 
            marketing authorisations for Monaco and conduct inspections on manufacturing sites

                  of medicinal products in Monaco. Batches from Monaco have to be considered as 
                  batches which have already undergone controls in a Member State and are therefore 
                  exempted  from  further  controls  and  retesting.  The  batches  may  be  regarded  as 
                  released in France, though the place of manufacturing sites is in Monaco. 
                  2.1    National authorisations 
                  The  competent  authorities  of  the  Member  States  are  responsible  for  granting 
                  marketing authorisations for medicinal products which are placed on their markets, 
                  except  for  medicinal  products  which  are  authorised  under  Regulation  (EC)  No 
                  726/2004 (“Union Authorisations” - see Section 2.2 of this chapter). 
                  In  order  to  obtain  a  national  marketing  authorisation,  an  application  must  be 
                  submitted to the competent authority of the Member State.  
                  In cases where national authorisations are requested for the same medicinal product7 
                  in more than one Member State and the marketing authorisation holder has received a 
                  marketing  authorisation  in  a  Member  State,  the  applicant/marketing  authorisation 
                  holder  must  submit  an  application  in  the  Member  States  concerned  using  the 
                  procedure of mutual recognition. The Member States concerned should then recognise 
                  the  marketing  authorisation  already  granted  by  the  reference  Member  State  and 
                  authorise the marketing of the product on their national territory.  
                  If no marketing authorisation has been granted in the Union, the applicant may make 
                  use of a decentralised procedure and submit an application in all the Member States 
                  where it intends to obtain a marketing authorisation at the same time, and choose one 
                  of them as reference Member State. Based on the assessment report prepared by the 
                  reference Member State and any comments made by the concerned Member State, 
                  marketing authorisation should be granted in accordance with the decision taken by 
                  the  reference  Member  State  and  concerned  Member  State  in  this  decentralised 
                  procedure.  
                  The mutual recognition procedure and the decentralised procedure are detailed in 
                  Chapter 2. 
                  The  marketing  authorisation  must  contain  the  summary  of  product  characteristics 
                  according to Article 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC and the labelling and the package 
                  leaflet according to Articles 54, 55, 59 and 63. 
                  2.2    Union authorisations 
                  The Union will grant marketing authorisations for medicinal products: 
                        referred to in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, which may only be 
                         authorised via the centralised procedure (mandatory scope); 
                                                                   
                  7 For an explanation of what constitutes the “same medicinal product” in this context, see section E.3 
                  of Commission communication on the Community marketing authorisation procedures for medicinal 
                  products (Official Journal C 229, 22/7/1998 p. 4 - 17).

                                  referred  to  in  Article  3(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  relating  to 
                                   products  containing  new  active  substances,  products  which  constitute  a 
                                   significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or products for which 
                                   the granting of a Union authorisation would be in the interest of patients or 
                                   animal health at Union level. The applicant has to request confirmation that 
                                   the  product  is  eligible  for  evaluation  through  the  centralised  procedure 
                                   (optional scope) and the EMA will decide on the matter; and 
                                  a generic medicinal product of a centrally authorised medicinal product if not 
                                   using the option in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004   
                         Scientific aspects and working definitions for the mandatory scope of the centralised 
                         procedure             drawn            up          by          EMA            are          available            at 
                         http://www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/regaffair/12194407en.pdf 
                         In  order  to  obtain  a  Union  authorisation,  an  application  must  be  submitted  to  the 
                         EMA. See also section 3.1 of this chapter.  
                         The scientific evaluation of the application is carried out within the Committee for 
                         Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA, and a scientific opinion is 
                         prepared. The opinion is sent to the European Commission which drafts a Decision. 
                         Having consulted the Member States through the relevant Standing Committee, the 
                         Commission adopts the Decision and grants a marketing authorisation (see Chapter 6 
                         of the Notice to applicants for further details on the decision making process). 
                         Such a marketing authorisation is valid throughout the Union and confers the same 
                         rights  and  obligations  in  each  of  the  Member  States  as  a  marketing  authorisation 
                         granted by that Member State. 
                         The  marketing  authorisation  must  contain  the  summary  of  product  characteristics 
                         according to Article 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC and the labelling and the package 
                         leaflet according to Title V of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
                         Once a central marketing authorisation has been issued, the maintenance of existing 
                         national  marketing  authorisation  or  the  issuing  of  new  national  marketing 
                         authorisations for the same medicinal product could be envisaged only as long as the 
                         therapeutic indications are different in national and central marketing authorisations.  
                         Indeed, if a product falls under the optional scope of the centralised procedure (Article 
                         3(2) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004), the applicant has the choice of using either 
                         the centralised or the national (decentralised/mutual recognition) procedure for the 
                         same  medicinal  product.  The  "Communication  on  the  Community  marketing 
                         authorisation procedures for medicinal products"8 clarifies that this choice does not 
                         allow both a central and a national marketing authorisation to co-exist simultaneously 
                         for the same product and that once a central marketing authorisation has been issued, 
                         there is no room for an additional scientific evaluation and regulatory decision for the 
                         same  medicinal  product  (see  in  particular  point  A.2  and  conclusion  of  the 
                                                                          
                         8 Commission Communication 98/C229/03 
                                                                                 7 
                                                                                   
                   
                  Communication). If such situation would occur the Commission would consider the 
                  need for a referral procedure.  
                  The  only  exception  for  possible  co-existence  of  central  and  national  marketing 
                  authorisation  that  the  Communication  provides  concern  cases  where  there  are 
                  different therapeutic indications (see point A.2.b).  
                   
                  2.3    Notion of ‘global marketing authorisation’9 
                  Article  6(1)  second  subparagraph  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  provides  that  when  a 
                  medicinal product has been granted an initial marketing authorisation, any additional 
                  strengths, pharmaceutical forms, administration routes, presentations as well as any 
                  variations and extensions must also be granted an authorisation or be included in the 
                  initial marketing authorisation. All these marketing authorisations are considered as 
                  belonging to the same global marketing authorisation, in particular for the purpose of 
                  the  application  of  Article  10  of  the  directive,  which  lays  down  rules  on  data 
                  exclusivity and market protection and on the so-called European Reference Product.  
                  Thus,  the  global  marketing  authorisation  contains  the  initial  authorisation  and  all 
                  variations and extensions thereof, as well as any additional strengths, pharmaceutical 
                  form, administration routes or presentations authorised through separate procedures, 
                  including in different  Member States within the  EU, and under a different name, 
                  granted to the marketing authorisation holder of the initial authorisation. Where a 
                  product is  initially  authorised  nationally  and,  subsequently,  an  additional  strength, 
                  pharmaceutical form, administration route or presentation is authorised through the 
                  centralised procedure, this is also part of the same global marketing authorisation. 
                  To determine the notion of same marketing authorisation holder or applicant in this 
                  context, see section 2.8. 
                     1.  If the medicinal product being assessed contains a modification of an existing 
                         active  substance,  it  should  be  clarified  during  the  marketing  authorisation 
                         procedure whether the product contains a new active substance or not. This 
                         clarification  impacts  on  the  existence  or  not  of  a  global  marketing 
                         authorisation  if  the  medicinal  products  belong  to  the  same  marketing 
                         authorisation  holder.  Request  for  a  new  active  substance  claim  should  be 
                         submitted within the initial marketing authorisation application for medicinal 
                         product  containing  the  modified  substance  and  will  not  be  considered 
                         retroactively. This assessment is to be done in accordance with the definition 
                                                                    10
                         of a new active substance provided in Annex I  at the end of this Chapter and 
                         the  conclusion  should  be  reflected  at  least  in  the  assessment  report.  If  the 
                         assessment report does not indicate that the product contains a new active 
                                                                   
                  9 Global Marketing Authorisation has to be read in the light of Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC; it 
                  does not mean a ‘world wide Marketing Authorisation’. 
                  10
                    Annex I at the end of this Chapter applies for the purposes of application of Article 6 and Article 10 
                     of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  However,  for  the  purposes  of  Article  3(2)  of  Regulation    (EC)  No 
                     726/2004 a "new active substance" is defined in paragraph 3 of the Annex of that Regulation.. 
                                                         8 
                                                           
                                            
                                                           substance, it will be considered that the product at stake contains the same 
                                                           active  substance  and  belongs  to  the  global  marketing  authorisation  of  the 
                                                           already  authorised  medicinal  product(s)  as  described  in  Article  6(1)  of 
                                                           Directive 2001/83/EC. 
                                                           Example: Active substance A in MP 1 active substance A’ in MP 2 
                                                   2.  If  the  medicinal  product  being  assessed  contains  within  the  same 
                                                           pharmaceutical form a combination of active substances, it will form a new 
                                                           and unique medicinal product requiring a separate marketing authorisation, 
                                                           regardless whether all of the active substances contained therein were already 
                                                           authorised  in  a  medicinal  product  or  not.  In  its  application  for  the  new 
                                                           combination, the applicant must demonstrate that each active substance has a 
                                                           documented therapeutic contribution within the combination and therefore all 
                                                                                                                                                             11
                                                           compounds are different active substance . The authorisation for this new 
                                                           combination medicinal product is not considered to fall within the scope of the 
                                                           global marketing authorisations of the already authorised medicinal product(s) 
                                                           as described in Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

                                                   3.  If  the  medicinal product being assessed contains only one active substance 
                                                           which  was  part  of  an  authorised  combination  product,  the  new  medicinal 
                                                           product will form a new and unique medicinal product requiring a separate 
                                                           marketing authorisation. Considering that during the assessment procedure of 
                                                           the  already  authorised  combination  product,  the  marketing  authorisation 
                                                           holder had demonstrated that each substance of the fixed combination has a

                     The implications of the notion of global marketing authorisation for the purpose of the 
                     application of rules on data exclusivity and market protection are referred to in section 
                     6 below.  
                     Multiple applications of the same marketing authorisation holder are covered by the 
                     notion of ‘global marketing authorisation’. 
                     2.4     Validity of the marketing authorisation 
                     2.4.1   Renewal 
                     Marketing authorisations granted in the Union have an initial duration of five years 
                     (Articles 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and 24(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC). 
                     After these five years, the marketing authorisation may be renewed on the basis of a 
                     re-evaluation  of  the  risk-benefit  balance.  To  this  end,  the  marketing  authorisation 
                     holder must provide the EMA or the national competent authority with a consolidated 
                     version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations 
                     introduced since the marketing authorisation was granted, at least nine months before 
                     the marketing authorisation ceases to be valid (Articles 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 
                     726/2004  and  24(2)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC).  Once  renewed,  the  marketing 
                     authorisation is valid for an unlimited period unless the Commission or the national 
                     competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to 
                     proceed with one additional five-year renewal (Articles 14(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
                     726/2004 and 24(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC). 
                     While the submission of the file should take place at least 9 months prior to the expiry 
                     of the marketing authorisation, premature submissions should be avoided.  In this 
                     regard, it is noted that the renewal should take place upon the expiry of the period of 
                     five years and that such decision will be based on the consolidated file submitted by 
                     the marketing authorisation holder for this purpose, demonstrating that the benefit-
                     risk is positive.  A submission that is made too prematurely may not be sufficiently up 
                     to date for the Commission/Competent Authorities to adopt a decision on the renewal. 
                     Recommendations regarding the content of the consolidated file for the renewal are 
                     provided in the EMA Guideline on the Processing of Renewals in the Centralised

                     2.4.2   Cessation of the marketing authorisation if the medicinal product is not 
                             marketed 
                     According to Article 24(4) to (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 14(4) to (6) of 
                     Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  any  authorisation  which  within  three  years  of  its 
                     granting is not followed by the actual placing on the market of the authorised product 
                     in the authorising Member State or on the Union market will cease to be valid. When 
                     an authorised product previously placed on the market in the authorising Member 
                     State or in the Union is no longer actually present on the market for a period of three 
                     consecutive  years,  the  authorisation  for  that  product  will  cease  to  be  valid.  The 
                     competent authority may, in exceptional circumstances and on public health grounds 
                     grant exemptions. Such exemptions must be duly justified. 
                     The  determination  of  the  start  of  the  three  year  period  from  the  granting  of  the 
                     marketing  authorisation  should  be  the  date  when  the  medicinal  product  can  be 
                     marketed by the marketing authorisation holder, taking into account, e.g. the market 
                     protection and other protection rules which have to be respected.  
                     The absence of the medicinal product from the market must be of three consecutive 
                     years, therefore in case the medicinal product would be put back on the market, the 
                     period of three years would restart. This situation may occur several times. 
                     The  marketing  authorisation  will  remain  valid  if  at  least  one  presentation  of  the 
                     medicinal product is placed on the market and if at least one pack-size of the existing 
                     pack-sizes for that presentation is marketed. For the purposes of the application of 
                     these  rules,  a  marketing  authorisation  comprises  the  initial  authorisation  and  all 
                     variations  and  extensions  granted  to  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  under  the 
                     same name. 
                     For the purposes of the application of Article 24(4) to (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
                     and Article 14(4) to (6) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, a medicinal product is 
                     “placed on the market” at the date of release into the distribution chain. It is the date 
                     when the product comes out of the control of the marketing authorisation holder. 
                     For centrally authorised medicinal products “placed on the Union market” means that 
                     the medicinal product is at least marketed in one Member State of the Union. For 
                     nationally  authorised  products  “placed  on  the  market  in  the  authorising  Member 
                     State” means that the medicinal product is on the market of the Member State which 
                     has  granted  the  marketing  authorisation.  This  is  independent  of  the  authorisation 
                     procedure used (decentralised, mutual recognition or purely national procedure). 
                     A  medicinal  product  ceases  to  be  placed  on  the  market  when  the  marketing 
                     authorisation holder ceases to release it in the distribution chain.  
                     Information regarding the placing of a medicinal product on the market should be 
                     provided in accordance with Article 23a of Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 13(4) of 
                     Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. After a marketing authorisation has been granted, the 
                     holder of the authorisation must inform the competent authority of the authorising 
                     Member State or the EMA of the date of actual marketing of the medicinal product in 
                     that  Member State or in the Union, taking into account the various presentations 
                     authorised. The holder must also notify the national competent authority or the EMA 
                                                                  11 
                                                                    
                   
                  if the product ceases to be placed on the market, either temporarily or permanently. 
                  Such notification must, otherwise than in exceptional circumstances, be made no less 
                  than 2 months before the interruption in the placing on the market of the product. The 
                  marketing authorisation holder must inform the national competent authorities or the 
                  EMA of the reasons for such action. Upon request by the national competent authority 
                  or  the  EMA,  particularly  in  the  context  of  pharmacovigilance,  the  marketing 
                  authorisation holder must provide the national competent authority or the EMA with 
                  all data relating to the volume of sales of the medicinal product, and any data in his 
                  possession relating to the volume of prescriptions. 
                  2.4.3 Suspension or withdrawal of medicinal product and voluntary withdrawal 
                  of marketing authorisation  
                  A  marketing  authorisation  holder  must  notify  respectively  the  Member  States 
                  concerned/EMA  of  any  action  taken  to  suspend  the  marketing  or  to  withdraw  a 
                  medicinal product from the market, to request the withdrawal or to not request the 
                  renewal of a marketing authorisation together with the reasons for such action. He 
                  must in particular declare if his action concerns the efficacy of the medicinal product 
                  or the protection of public health. 
                  2.5    Name of a medicinal product 
                  A marketing authorisation is granted to a single marketing authorisation holder who is 
                  responsible  for  placing  the  medicinal  product  on  the  market.  The  marketing 
                  authorisation,  delivered  through  centralised,  national  or  decentralised/mutual 
                  recognition procedure, must contain the name of the medicinal product, which may be 
                  either  an  invented  name,  or  a  common  or  scientific  name  (when  available,  the 
                  International  Non-Proprietary  Name  of  the  active  substance(s))  accompanied  by  a 
                  trade mark or the name of the marketing authorisation holder. 
                  In  the  case  of  Union  authorisations  granted  following  applications  through  the 
                  centralised procedure, it is important that applicants identify at an early stage a name 
                  which would be valid throughout the Union when using the centralised procedure. 
                  However, in exceptional cases, the Commission may authorise the use of a different 
                  name in a Member State where the proposed name has been cancelled, opposed or 
                  objected to under trade-mark law (Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004).  
                  See  also  the  EMA  ‘Guideline  on  the  acceptability  of  name  for  human  medicinal 
                  products    processed    through     centralised   procedure’    available    at 
                  http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Regulatory_and_procedura
                  l_guideline/2009/10/WC500004142.pdf 
                  For applications through the mutual recognition and decentralised procedures, it is 
                  recommended whenever feasible that the same name for a given medicinal product 
                  should be used in all Member States. If a different name is to be used, it should be 
                  quoted in a covering letter from the applicant to the relevant competent authorities. 
                  Where a generic of a medicinal product authorised through the centralised procedure 
                  is authorised by the competent authorities of the Member States in accordance with 
                  Article 10(1) of the Directive 2001/83/EC, the generic medicinal product has to be 
                                                        12 
                                                           
                    
                   authorised under the same name in all the Member States where the application has 
                   been made. For these purposes, all the linguistic versions of the international non-
                   proprietary name is considered to be the same name (Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) 
                   No 726/2004). 
                    2.6   Transparency  
                   In  accordance  with  Article  21  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  the  national  competent 
                   authorities are obliged to make publicly available the decision granting the marketing 
                   authorisation  together  with  the  package  leaflet,  the  summary  of  the  product 
                   characteristics and any possible conditions to the marketing authorisation. In addition, 
                   they must draw up an assessment report for each marketing authorisation granted, 
                   together with the reasons for their opinion, after deletion of any information of a 
                   commercially confidential nature. The justification should be provided separately for 
                   each indication applied for.  
                   As regards products authorised through the centralised procedure, notification of the 
                   marketing authorisation must be published in the Official Journal of the European 
                   Union and the EMA must publish the assessment report of the CHMP together with 
                   the  reasons  for  its  opinion,  after  deletion  of  any  information  of  a  commercially 
                   confidential nature (Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004). 
                   2.7    Multiple applications 
                   In the framework of the centralised procedure only one marketing authorisation may 
                   be granted to an applicant for a specific medicinal product.  
                                                          nd
                   However, according to Article 82(1) 2  subparagraph of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 
                   the  same  applicant  can  submit  more  than  one  application  for  the  same  medicinal 
                   product when there are objective verifiable reasons relating to public health regarding 
                   the availability of medicinal products to health-care professionals and/or patients or 
                   for  co-marketing reasons. In such case, the Commission will inform the applicant 
                   whether the conditions are met before he submits his application to the EMA. For 
                   further  details  see  the  Commission  services  note  on  the  handling  of  Duplicate 
                   Marketing Authorisation Application,  
                   http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/latest_news/2011_09_upd.pdf  
                   There  are  no  corresponding  provisions  in  Directive  2001/83/EC  that  apply  to  the 
                   mutual  recognition  and  decentralised  procedures.  In  such  circumstances,  the 
                   acceptance  of  multiple  applications  in  mutual  recognition  and  decentralised 
                   procedures should, however, not be used to undermine harmonisation at Union level 
                   or  to  circumvent  the  application  of  Union  legislation.  In  particular,  multiple 
                   applications  should  not lead to  applications for  the same  medicinal product being 
                   submitted in different Member States and handled outside the principles of mutual 
                   recognition laid down in chapter IV of Directive 2001/83/EC. To avoid such an effect, 
                   the following principles should be observed: 
                   -  reference  to    any  authorisation  obtained  for  that  medicinal  product  should  be 
                      provided with the application for a marketing authorisation; 
                                                            13 
                                                               
                   
                  -  as far as possible, the same reference Member State should be used in case of 
                    multiple applications; 
                  -  Article 18 should be relied on to avoid that multiple applications are used to obtain 
                    marketing  authorisations  for  the  same  medicinal  product  in  different  Member 
                    States outside the procedural framework of chapter IV of Directive 2001/83/EC; 
                  -  the  applicant  may  decide  whether  the  mutual  recognition  procedure  or  the 
                    decentralised  procedure  is  used  for  obtaining  the  multiple    marketing 
                    authorisations. 
                    
                  See CMDh Recommendations on Multiple Applications in Mutual Recognition and 
                  Decentralised Procedures available at http://www.hma.eu/91.html 
                  2.8    Concept of "applicant" and "marketing authorisation holder" 
                  The concept of "applicant" and "marketing authorisation holder" are important for the 
                  application of the global marketing authorisation definition and also in other contexts, 
                  such as the submission of applications under Directive 2001/83/EC, the submission of 
                  variations under work-sharing procedures or the submission of multiple marketing 
                  authorisations under Article 82(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The definition of 
                                                                               14
                  "applicant" provided for in the 1998 Commission Communication  is still applicable 
                  and is clarified below. 
                   
                  An "applicant" and "marketing authorisation holder" can be a physical or legal entity.  
                  However, for the purposes of the application of the pharmaceuticals rules, having a 
                  distinct  legal  personality  does  not  necessarily  entail  that  each  entity    can  be 
                  considered as a distinct applicant or marketing authorisation holder to the other one.  
                  In particular, it is noted: 
                    Applicants and marketing authorisation holders belonging to the same company 
                     group  or  that  are  controlled  by  the  same  physical  or  legal  entity  are  to  be 
                     considered as one entity.   
                   
                    Applicants and marketing authorisation holders that do not belong to the same 
                     company group and are not controlled by the same physical or legal entity are to 
                     be  considered  as  one  applicant/marketing  authorisation  holder  if  they  have 
                     concluded  tacit  or  explicit  agreements  concerning  the  marketing  of  the  same 
                     medicinal product for the purposes of the application of the pharmaceuticals rules 
                     regarding that medicinal product.  This includes cases of joint marketing but also 
                     cases where one party licenses to the other party the right to market the same 
                     medicinal product in exchange for fees or other considerations. 
                   
                   
                  This concept applies, mutatis mutandis, to the definition of "sponsor" in the context of 
                  orphan designations.

                     3.    MARKETING AUTHORISATION PROCEDURES 
                    3.1    Centralised procedure 
                    A marketing authorisation granted under the centralised procedure is valid for the 
                    entire EU market, which means the medicinal product may be put on the market in all 
                    Member States. For medicinal products which fall within the mandatory scope of the 
                    centralised procedure in accordance with the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, 
                    the application is submitted to the EMA. An application may likewise be submitted to 
                    the  EMA  for  medicinal  products  which  fall  within  the  optional  scope  of  the 
                    centralised procedure in accordance with Article 3(2) and 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
                    726/2004 where the applicant wishes to obtain a Union marketing authorisation.  
                     
                    In particular, applications on the basis of Article 10, where the reference medicinal 
                    products  is  centrally  authorised  may  be  submitted  via  the  centralised  procedure. 
                    Alternatively, they may be authorised by the competent authorities of the Member 
                    States through a national, mutual recognition procedure or decentralised procedure 
                    provided that the conditions, laid down in Article 3(3) of the Regulation are met (e.g. 
                    same summary of product characteristics, same name in all the Member States). 
                     
                    Those Similar biological (“biosimilar”) medicinal products which are developed by 
                    means of one of the biotechnological processes listed in the Annex to Regulation(EC) 
                    No 726/2004  must however be authorised via the centralised procedure. 
                     
                    Following the scientific evaluation and upon receipt of the opinion, the European 
                    Commission  drafts  a  decision  on  an  Union  marketing  authorisation  and,  after 
                    consulting the Standing Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, grants a 
                    marketing  authorisation.  The  Commission  Decision  shall,  based  on  the  scientific 
                    recommendation of the CHMP, specify in its Annexes the conditions or restrictions 
                    regarding  the  supply  and  use  including  the  following  sub-categories:  medicinal 
                    product subject to medical prescription, medicinal product subject to special and/or 
                    restricted prescription, medicinal product not subject to prescription. Any restriction 
                    foreseen  in  supply  and  use  reflected  in  Section  4.2  of  the  Summary  of  Product 
                    Characteristics will be translated into the legal status in Annex II. 
                     
                    When a marketing authorisation application is submitted for a product which is of 
                    major  public  health  interest,  in  particular  from  the  viewpoint  of  therapeutic 
                    innovation,  the  applicant  may  request  an  accelerated  assessment  procedure  in 
                    accordance with Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. The applicant should 
                    justify their expectation that the medicinal product is of major public health interest 
                    particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation.  
                     
                    For  further  details  on  the  documentation  required  to  substantiate  a  request  for 
                    accelerated assessment and on the reduced timetable, reference is made to the EMA 
                    website.  
                                                               15 
                                                                 
             
            3.1.1  Conditional  marketing  authorisation,  marketing  authorisation  granted 
                under exceptional circumstances and marketing authorisation subject to 
                conditions 
            The conditional marketing authorisation is only provided for the centralised procedure 
            (Article  14(7)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  Commission  regulation  (EC)  No 
            507/2006 is laying down the rules on the granting of such marketing authorisation.  
             
            It  must  be  distinguished  from  the  marketing  authorisation  under  exceptional 
            circumstances  (Article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  and  Article  22  of 
            Directive 2001/83/EC) and the marketing authorisation subject to conditions (Article 
            9.4  b,  c,  ca,  cb,  cc.  of  Regulation  No  726/2004  and  Article  21a  of  Directive 
            2001/83/EC)  which  are  possible  under  centralised  and  National/DCP/MRP 
            procedures.  
             
            3.1.2 Orphan medicinal products 
            There are two EU Regulations covering orphan medicinal products: Regulation (EC) 
            No  141/2000  and  its  implementing  regulation,  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
                  15
            847/2000 . 
            The aim of the legislation on orphan medicinal products is to stimulate research and 
            development  of  medicinal  products  for  rare  diseases  by  providing  incentives  to 
            sponsors  in  order  to  ensure  access  to  treatment  for  patients  suffering  from  rare 
            diseases. Incentives include a 10-year period of market exclusivity once an orphan 
            medicinal product is authorised, protocol assistance, eligibility for Union and Member 
            State  initiatives  which  support  research  and  development  of  orphan  medicinal 
            products, and the possibility to request fee reductions from the EMA.  
            3.1.3 Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products 
            Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 
            November 2007 on Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP)  applies in the 
            European Union from 30 December 2008. 
             
            3.1.4 Transfer of a Union marketing authorisation 
            The transfer of a marketing authorisation granted under the centralised procedure is 
            regulated in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2141/96, of 7 November 1996. 
             
            In accordance with that Regulation, the marketing authorisation holder should submit 
            an application to the EMA with supported documents. 
             
            When transferring  the  marketing  authorisation  of  a  designated  Orphan  medicinal 
            product, the marketing authorisation holder must also transfer the Orphan designation 
            of the product concerned in accordance with Article 5(11) of Regulation (EC) No 
            141/2000.

                     3.2     Decentralised procedure and mutual recognition procedure 
                     Both  the  decentralised  and  the  mutual  recognition  procedures  are  based  on  the 
                     recognition  by  national  competent  authorities  of  an  assessment  performed  by  the 
                     authorities of one Member State. According to the European Court of Justice, "[…] 
                     Article  28  of  Directive  2001/83/EC […] confers a Member State in receipt of an 
                     application for mutual recognition only a very limited discretion in relation to the 
                     reasons for which that Member State is entitled to refuse to recognise the marketing 
                     authorisation in question. In particular, as regards any assessment going beyond the 
                     verification of the validity of the application with regard to the conditions laid down 
                     in Article 28, the Member State concerned, except where there is a risk to public 
                     health,  must rely on the assessments and scientific evaluations carried out by the 
                                                16
                     reference Member State" . Although the facts of the case relate to a MRP, the ECJ is 
                                                                                         17
                     interpreting Article 28 (4) which applies both to MRP and DCP .  
                     To allow operation of the system, applicants for marketing authorisation are obliged 
                     to  include  in  their  applications  copies  of  any  authorisation  previously  obtained  in 
                     other Member States as well as a list of those Member States in which an application 
                     for authorisation is under examination (article 8(3)(l) of Directive 2001/83/EC). In 
                     addition, the dossier on which the marketing authorisation is based must be regularly 
                     updated (see section 5.1.1 below). 
                     3.2.1   Decentralised procedure 
                     For  medicinal  products  not  falling  within  the  mandatory  scope  of  the  centralised 
                     procedure,  the  applicant  may  request  one  or  more  concerned  Member  State(s)  to 
                     approve  a  draft  assessment  report,  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC), 
                     labelling and package leaflet as proposed by the chosen reference Member State. An 
                     application is submitted to the competent authorities of the reference Member State 
                     and the concerned Member State(s), together with the information and particulars 
                     referred to in Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b, 10c, and 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The 
                     applicant  must  give  an  assurance  that  the  dossier,  including  the  proposed  SmPC, 
                     labelling and package leaflet, is identical as submitted in all Member States concerned 
                     (reference  Member  State  and  concerned  Member  State).  Differences  in  proposed 
                     prescription status and names of the medicinal product are acceptable, in line with 
                     national rules in force.  
                     At  the  end  of  the  decentralised  procedure  with  a  positive  agreement,  a  national 
                     marketing  authorisation  will  be  issued  in  the  reference  Member  State  and  the 
                     concerned Member State. The harmonisation is maintained through the procedures of

                                                                  17 
                                                                    
                      
                     Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 for the examination of variations and the use of the 
                     decentralised and mutual recognition procedures for extensions. 
                     For further details see chapter 2.  
                     3.2.2   Mutual recognition procedure 
                     This procedure is based on the mutual recognition by concerned Member State(s) of a 
                     national  marketing  authorisation  granted  by  the  reference  Member  State.  The 
                     concerned Member State refers to the reference Member State that issued the national 
                     marketing authorisation on which the mutual recognition procedure is based. 
                     At the end of the mutual recognition procedure, a national marketing authorisation 
                     will be issued in the concerned Member State(s). The harmonisation is maintained 
                     through the procedures  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1234/2008  for  the  examination  of 
                     variations  and  the  use  of  the  decentralised  and  mutual  recognition  procedures  for 
                     extensions and renewals. 
                     For further details see chapter 2.  
                     3.3 Procedure for homeopathic medicinal products  
                     According to Article 13 of Directive 2001/83/EC, Member States have to ensure that 
                     homeopathic medicinal products placed on the market within the Union are either 
                     registered according to Articles 14 and 15 or authorised according to Article 16 of that 
                               18
                     directive.  
                      
                     It follows from Article 1(5) of Directive 2001/83/EC that a homeopathic medicinal 
                     product is any medicinal product prepared from substances called homeopathic stocks 
                     in  accordance  with  a  homeopathic  manufacturing  procedure  described  by  the 
                                                 19
                     European  Pharmacopoeia   or,  in  the  absence  thereof,  by  the  pharmacopoeias 
                     currently used officially in the Member States. A homeopathic medicinal product may 
                     contain a number of principles. 
                      
                     Based on the particular characteristics of homeopathic medicinal products, such as the 
                     very low level of active principles they contain and the difficulty of applying to them 
                     the conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials, Articles 14 and 15 of 
                     Directive  2001/83/EC  provide  for  a  simplified  registration  procedure  for  those 
                     homeopathic medicinal products which  are placed on the market without therapeutic 
                     indications in a pharmaceutical form and dosage which do not present a risk for the 
                     patient.  Furthermore,  according  to  Article  13(2)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  the 
                     Member States are obliged to establish the abovementioned simplified registration 
                     procedure for the homeopathic medicinal products referred to in Article 14.  
                                                                      
                     18
                         As  Directive  2001/83/EC  provides  for  a  complete  harmonisation  of  national  authorisation 
                     procedures  for  medicinal  products,  no  other  procedures  can  be  set  up  for  homeopathic  medicinal 
                     products but the ones provided by Directive 2001/83/EC, see ECJ-Case C-84/06.  
                      
                     19
                        See section 5.1.2  
                                                                  18 
                                                                    
           
           
          However,  if  a  homeopathic  medicinal  product  is  not  eligible  for  the  simplified 
          registration procedure, before placing the product on the market of a Member State, it 
          has  to  be  authorised,  regardless  of  the  marketing  authorisation  procedure  in 
          accordance with Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b, 10c and 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC as 
          appropriate. 
           
          Nevertheless, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC, in case of a 
          national procedure, a Member State may introduce or retain in its territory specific 
          rules for the pre-clinical tests and clinical trials of homeopathic medicinal products 
          other than those referred to in Article 14(1) in accordance with the principles and 
          characteristics of homeopathy as practised in that Member State. Accordingly, if the 
          homeopathic medicinal product is eligible for the simplified registration procedure, 
          the Member State cannot introduce other requirements than the ones following from 
          Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
           
          An application  under  the  simplified  registration  procedure  may  cover  a  series  of 
          medicinal  products  derived  from  the  same  homeopathic  stock  or  stocks.  The 
          simplified  registration  procedure  allows  the  registration  of  homeopathic  medicinal 
          products, provided that they are administered orally or externally, that no specific 
          therapeutic indication appears on the labelling of the medicinal product or in any 
          information  relating  thereto,  and  that  there  is  a  sufficient  degree  of  dilution  to 
          guarantee the safety of the medicinal product. 
           
          In addition, in order to demonstrate, in particular, the pharmaceutical quality and the 
          batch-to batch homogeneity of the products concerned, the applicant has to provide 
          the documents set up by Article 15 of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
           
          According to Article 14(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC the criteria and rules of procedure 
          provided  for  in  Article  17(1)  of  that  directive  apply  by  analogy  to  the  special, 
          simplified  registration  procedure  for  homeopathic  medicinal  products.  Hence,  an 
          application under the simplified registration procedure must be assessed within 210 
          days after the submission of a valid application.  
           
          However, it follows from Article 39 of Directive 2001/83/EC that Article 29(4), (5) 
          and (6) and Articles 30 to 34 do not apply to the homeopathic medicinal products 
          registered  under  the  simplified  registration  procedure.  Consequently,  if  a  Member 
          State  cannot  approve  the  assessment  under  the  simplified  registration  procedure 
          conducted by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to 
          public health, and the Member States fail to reach an agreement in the coordination 
          group, the case will not be submitted to the EMA for arbitration. Each Member State 
          will therefore take its own decision.  
           
          According to Article 68 of Directive 2001/83/EC, homeopathic medicinal products 
          must be labelled in accordance with the provisions of title V of Directive 2001/83/EC 
          on the labelling and package leaflet, and be identified by a reference on their labels, in 
          clear and legible form, to their homeopathic nature. However, it follows from Article 
          69  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  that  in  addition  to  the  clear  mention  of  the  words 
          "homeopathic medicinal product", the labelling and, where appropriate, the package 
          leaflet  for  homeopathic  medicinal  products  authorised  under  the  simplified 
                              19 
                                
                   
                  registration procedure must bear no other information than those mentioned in Article 
                  69 of that Directive.   
                   
                  However, the principles and the procedural rules of title V of Directive 2001/83/EC 
                  will apply to those products. Hence, according to Article 56, the particulars referred to 
                  in  Article  69  must  be  easily  legible,  clearly  comprehensible  and  indelible. 
                  Furthermore, as there is no waiver from the Braille requirements laid down by Article 
                  56a  of  the  Directive  with  regard  to  homeopathic  medicinal  products  registered 
                  through  the  simplified  procedure,  these  requirements  apply  also  to  homeopathic 
                  medicinal products. However, this requirement has to be read in conjunction with 
                  Article 69(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, which provides that the labelling and, where 
                  appropriate, the package leaflet for the homeopathic medicinal products registered 
                  through the simplified procedure, must bear only the information provided by that 
                  article. Accordingly, the scientific name of the stock or stocks followed by the degree 
                  of dilution should be put in Braille format on the packaging of the product. If the 
                  scientific names of the stocks on the labelling are supplemented by an invented name, 
                  this should also be put in Braille format.  
                   
                  According to Article 58 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the inclusion in the packaging of all 
                  medicinal  products  of  a  package  leaflet  is  obligatory,  unless  all  the  information 
                  required is directly conveyed on the outer packaging or on the immediate packaging. 
                  Furthermore,  according  to  Article  56a  of  the  said  directive,  the  marketing 
                  authorisation holder hall ensure that the package leaflet is made available on request 
                  from patients' organisations, in formats appropriate for the blind and partially sighted. 
                  Consequently,  if  package  leaflets  are  needed  for  homeopathic  medicinal  products 
                  registered through the simplified procedure, they are also to be made available in 
                  formats appropriate for the blind and partially-sighted.  
                   
                  3.4    Procedure      for    traditional    herbal     medicinal     products 
                         (traditional-use registration) 
                  In order to overcome difficulties encountered by Member States in applying in the 
                  same  way  the  pharmaceutical  legislation  to  herbal  medicinal  products,  specific 
                  provisions have been introduced in the Union code relating to medicinal products for 
                  human use for traditional herbal medicinal products. According to Articles 16a to 16i 
                  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  a  specific  registration  procedure  is  foreseen  for  herbal 
                  medicinal products fulfilling the criteria of a traditional herbal medicinal product. 
                  That  registration  procedure  is  intended  for  herbal  medicinal  products  with  a  long 
                  tradition, which do not fulfil the requirements for a marketing authorisation, including 
                  those set out in Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC. In particular where an applicant 
                  cannot demonstrate by detailed references to published scientific literature that the 
                  constituent  or  the  constituents  of  the  medicinal  products  has  or  have  a  well-
                  established medicinal use with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety.  
                  The simplified procedure allows the registration of herbal medicinal products without 
                  requiring  particulars  and  documents  on  tests  and  trials  on  safety  and  efficacy, 
                                                        20 
                                                           
           
          provided  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  of  the  medicinal  use  of  the  product 
          throughout a period of at least 30 years, including at least 15 years in the Union.   
          According  to  Article  16c(1)(c)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  bibliographical  or  expert 
          evidence  to  the  effect  that  the  medicinal  product  in  question,  or  a  corresponding 
          product has been in medicinal use throughout a period of at least 30 years preceding 
          the date of the application, including at least 15 years within the Union. Medicinal use 
          which has taken place on the territory of a new Member State is to be taken into 
          account for the purpose of application of Article 16c(1)(c) even if it has partly or fully 
          occurred before the accession of that State to the European Union. 
          Applications for registration of traditional herbal medicinal products have to fulfil the 
          same requirements as applications for a marketing authorisation with regard to the 
          manufacturing of these products and their quality. 
          The long tradition makes it possible to reduce the need for clinical data, in so far as 
          the efficacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of its long-standing use 
          and experience as testified by bibliographic or expert evidence. 
          Indications must be exclusively appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products, 
          which by virtue of their composition and purpose, are intended and designed for use 
          without  the  supervision  of  a  medical  practitioner  for  diagnostic  purposes  or  for 
          prescription  or  monitoring  of  treatment.  However,  to  prevent  treatment  of  more 
          serious pathologies with traditional herbal medicinal products, it is possible for the 
          indications of traditional herbal medicinal products to refer to the use after exclusion 
          of serious conditions by a medical doctor. In any case, the traditional herbal medicinal 
          product still needs to be intended and designed for use without the supervision of a 
          medical  practitioner  for  diagnostic  purposes  or  for  prescription  or  monitoring  of 
          treatment.  The  traditional  herbal  medicinal  product  has  to  be  a  non-prescription 
          medicinal product.  
          Applicants must substantiate the safety of the medicinal product by the means of a 
          bibliographic review of safety data together with an expert report, complemented by 
          any necessary data, which the Member State’s competent authority may request. 
          Results  of  pharmaceutical  (physico-chemical,  biological  or  microbiological)  tests 
          must  be  submitted  to  demonstrate  the  quality  of  the  traditional  herbal  medicinal 
          product. 
          The presence in herbal medicinal products of vitamins and minerals, the safety of 
          which  is  well  documented,  does  not  prevent  these  products  to  be  eligible  for 
          registration, provided that the action of the vitamins/minerals is ancillary to that of the 
          herbal active ingredients regarding the specified claimed indications. 
          Having regard to the particularities of herbal medicinal products, a Committee for 
          Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) has been established at the EMA in accordance 
          with Article 16h of Directive 2001/83/EC. The HMPC is responsible for various tasks 
          concerning  the  simplified  registration  and  authorisation  of  medicinal  products  as 
          provided for in Directive 2001/83/EC and in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, including 
          involvement in referral procedures concerning such products. 
                              21 
                                
                    
                   With  a  view  to  further  facilitating  the  registration  of  certain  traditional  herbal 
                   medicinal  products  in  the  EU,  a  list  of  herbal  substances,  preparations  and 
                   combinations thereof for use in traditional herbal medicinal products is established on 
                   the  basis  of  the  scientific  opinion  of  the  HMPC.  Applicants  can  refer  to  the  list, 
                   however they would still need to demonstrate the quality of the medicinal products 
                   they seek to register. 
                   Another major task of the HMPC is to establish Union herbal monographs for the 
                   application of both the traditional use and well-established use provisions and to serve 
                   as  a  basis  for  simplified  registration  or  bibliographical  marketing  authorisation 
                   applications.  When  monographs  have  been  established,  they  must  be  taken  into 
                   account  by  the  Member  State  when  examining  an  application.  Accordingly,  even 
                   though the Member States are not obliged to follow the monograph, any decisions to 
                   not accept the content of the monograph as adopted by the HMPC should be duly 
                   justified taking into account the important role of monographs to bring harmonisation 
                   to this field, and to facilitate the use of the simplified registration procedure. 
                   In order to promote harmonisation, Member States should recognise registrations of 
                   traditional  herbal  medicinal  products  granted  by  another  Member  State  based  on 
                   Union herbal monographs or consisting of substances, preparations or combinations 
                   thereof  contained  in  the  above-mentioned  list.  For  other  products,  Member  States 
                   should take due account of such registrations. 
                   3.5    Paediatric requirements for medicinal products 
                                                   20
                   Regulation (EC) No. 1901/2006  of the European Parliament and of the Council on 
                   medicinal products for pediatric use entered into force on 26 January 2007. It aims to 
                   facilitate  the  development  and  availability  of  medicinal  products  for  use  in  the 
                                        21
                   paediatric population . To attain this goal, the Regulation places on applicants certain 
                   obligations, the main one being submission of data on the use of a medicinal product 
                   in children obtained in accordance with an agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP) 
                   by EMA. Provided that the requirements of Regulation 1901/2006 are fulfilled, the 
                   applicants may be then eligible for a reward, as provided in Title V of this Regulation,

                   3.6    Independent national procedures 
                   Independent national procedures will continue, but are strictly limited to medicinal 
                   products which are not to be authorised in more than one Member State.  
                   In addition, as provided for in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC, harmonisation 
                   of authorisations for medicinal products authorised in the Union is to be promoted via 
                   a  coordinated  approach  for  referring  medicinal  products,  for  which  divergent 
                   decisions have been adopted, to the EMA and the Committee for Medicinal Products 
                   for Human Use (see section 4).  
                   Independent  national  procedures  can  also  be  used  for  extensions  of  authorised 
                   medicinal products as far as no a priori harmonisation has been achieved for the initial 
                   marketing authorisation (see section 7 of this chapter). 
                   3.7    Procedures according to Article 126a of Directive 2001/83/EC  
                   In  order  to  increase  availability  of  medicinal  products,  in  particular  on  smaller 
                   markets, Article 126a of Directive 2001/83/EC provides that, in  the absence of a 
                   marketing authorisation or of a pending application for authorisation for a medicinal 
                   product, which has already been authorised in another Member State, a Member State 
                   may for justified public health reasons authorise the placing on the market of that 
                   medicinal product. In such cases, the competent authority of the Member State has to 
                   inform the marketing authorisation holder in the Member State in which the medicinal 
                   product concerned is authorised, of the proposal to authorise the placing on the market 
                   under this Article.  
                   When a Member State avails itself of this possibility, it must adopt the necessary 
                   measures in order to ensure that the requirements for the labelling and package leaflet, 
                   classification  of  the  medicinal  product,  advertising,  pharmacovigilance  and 
                   supervision and sanctions are complied with. For the specific mechanisms chosen by 
                   the  Member States  to  implement  this  provision,  we  refer  to  the  relevant  national 
                   legislation. .

                     For  medicinal  products  authorised  in  accordance  with  Article  126a  of  Directive 
                     2001/83/EC, marketing authorisation holders do not qualify for the rewards in the 
                     sense of Regulation 1901/2006 as described in section 3.5 above.

                    In certain circumstances in the framework of marketing authorisations granted by the 
                    competent authorities of the Member States, a Union procedure, involving a scientific 
                    opinion  by,  as  appropriate,  the  CHMP/Pharmacovigilance  Risk  Assessment 
                    Committee  (PRAC)  can  be  triggered.  This  procedure  is  commonly  called  Union 
                    “referral”, which may be triggered in the cases listed below and which are further 
                    described in chapter 3 of volume 2A of the Notice to applicant: 
                    i)     in accordance with Article 29 of Directive 2001/83/EC, where one or more 
                           concerned Member States cannot agree on the recognition of an authorisation 
                           already granted in a mutual recognition procedure or a final assessment and 
                           product  information  prepared  by  the  Reference  Member  State  in  view  of 
                           granting  the  marketing  authorisation  in  a  decentralised  procedure  due  to  a 
                                                                   23
                           potential serious risk to public health , the points of disagreement must be 
                           referred to the coordination group provided by Article 27 of that Directive..  
                           Where  the  Member  States  concerned  by  the  procedure  fail  to  reach  an 
                           agreement within the coordination group, the matter is referred to the CHMP 
                           for application of the procedure laid down in Articles 32 to 34 of Directive 
                           2001/83/EC. This referral is automatic in the sense that, once a Member State 
                           has raised a concern on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health 
                           within the meaning of Article 29(1), withdrawal of the marketing authorisation 
                           application in that Member State does not prevent the concern from being 
                           analysed  within  the  coordination  group  and,  in  absence  of  an  agreement 
                           therein, the EMA. The expression ‘potential serious risk to public health’ is 
                           defined in the Commission's Guideline on the definition of a potential serious 
                           risk  to  public  health  in  the  context  of  Article  29(1)  and  (2)  of  Directive

                    ii)    in  accordance with Article 30(1) of  Directive 2001/83/EC, if two or more 
                           applications submitted in accordance with Article 8, 10, 10a, 10b 10c and 11 
                           of that Directive have been made for marketing authorisation for a particular 
                           medicinal product, and if Member States have adopted divergent decisions 
                           concerning  the  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  or  its  suspension  or 
                           revocation, a Member State, the Commission or applicant or the marketing 
                           authorisation  holder  may  refer  the  matter  to  the  Committee  for  Medicinal 
                           Products for Human Use, […], for the application of the procedure laid down 
                           in Articles 32, 33 and 34; 
                    iii)   in accordance with Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC, in order to promote 
                           harmonisation  of  authorisations  for  medicinal  products  authorised  in  the 
                           Union, Member States must, each year, forward to the coordination group a 
                           list  of  medicinal  products  for  which  a  harmonised  summary  of  product

                               characteristics should be drawn up. The coordination group must lay down a 
                               list taking into account the proposals from all Member States and will forward 
                               this list to the Commission. The Commission or a Member State, in agreement 
                               with the Agency and taking into account the views of interested parties, may 
                               refer these products to the Committee […] 
                                                                                                  25
                       iv)     in accordance with Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC , the Member States 
                               or  the  Commission  or  the  applicant  or  the  marketing  authorisation  holder 
                               must, in specific cases where the interests of the Union are involved, refer the 
                               matter to the Committee for the application of the procedure laid down in 
                               Articles  32,  33  and  34  before  any  decision  is  reached  on  a  request  for  a 
                               marketing authorisation or on the suspension or revocation of an authorisation, 
                               or any other variation to the terms of a marketing authorisation which appears 
                               necessary. Where the referral results from the evaluation of data relating to 
                               pharmacovigilance  the  matter  must  be  referred  to  the  PRAC.  Its  final 
                               recommendation will be forwarded to the CHMP or the coordination group, as 
                               appropriate. . However when one of the criteria listed in Article 107i(1) is met, 
                               the  procedure  laid  down  in  Articles  107i  to  107k  must  apply.  Where  the 
                               referral  concerns  a  range  of  medicinal  products  or  a  therapeutic  class,  the 
                               Agency may limit the procedure to certain specific parts of the authorisation. 
                               In such case, Article 35 must apply to those medicinal products only if they 
                               were  covered  by  the  authorisation  procedures  referred  to  in  this  chapter 
                               [decentralised and mutual recognition procedures].   
                                                                                                   26
                       v)      in accordance with Article 107i of Directive 2001/83/EC  A Member State or 
                               the Commission, as appropriate, must, on the basis of concerns resulting from 
                               the evaluation of data from pharmacovigilance activities: 
                                    a)  initiate the procedure provided for in the section by informing the other 
                                        Member States, the Agency and the Commission where it considers 
                                        suspending  or  revoking  a  marketing  authorisation,  prohibiting  the 
                                        supply of a medicinal product, refusing the renewal of a marketing 
                                        authorisation, or it is informed that the marketing authorisation holder, 
                                        on  the  basis  of  safety  concerns,  has  interrupted  the  placing  on  the 
                                        market of a medicinal product or has taken action to have a marketing 
                                        authorisation  withdrawn,  or  intends  to  take  such  action  or  has  not 
                                        applied for the renewal of a marketing authorisation.  
                                    b)  inform  the  other  Member  States,  the  Agency  and  the  Commission 
                                        where  it  considers  that  a  new  contraindication,  a  reduction  in  the 
                                        recommended dose or a restriction to the indications of a medicinal 
                                        product  is  necessary.  The  information  must  outline  the  action

                               Article 32; and in accordance with Article 16h(d) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
                               where other medicinal products containing herbal substances are referred to 
                               the  Agency under Chapter 4 of Title III, to give an opinion on the herbal 
                               substance where appropriate.

                               down in point (a) of Article 7(1). The procedure is limited to the assessment of 
                               the specific sections of the summary of product characteristics to be varied. 
                        
                        5.     APPLICATION TYPES 
                       The legal requirements and the procedures for making an application for a marketing 
                       authorisation  are  set  out  in  Directive  2001/83/EC  and  in  Regulation  (EC)  No 
                       726/2004. 
                       A brief description of these requirements and procedures is set out in this chapter for 
                       applications:  
                              according to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC; 
                              according to Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC, relating to generic medicinal 
                               products,  "hybrid"  medicinal  products    and  similar  biological  medicinal 
                               products; 
                              according  to  Article  10a  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  relating  to  applications 
                               relying  on  well-established  medicinal  use  supported  by  bibliographic 
                               literature; 
                              according to Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC , relating to applications for 
                               new fixed combination of active substances in a medicinal product; 
                              according  to  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  relating  to  informed 
                               consent  from  a  marketing  authorisation  holder  for  an  authorised  medicinal 
                               product. 
                                                                        27 
                                                                           
                      
                     It is important, however, that the requirements and procedures are not confused with 
                     the presentation of the application dossier, on which guidance is given in "The Rules 
                     Governing  Medicinal  Products  in  the  European  Union,  Volume  2B  Notice  to 
                     Applicants: Presentation and content of the dossier". 
                     5.1     Basic requirements 
                     5.1.1   Continuous update of marketing authorisation  
                     The main principle underlying Union pharmaceutical legislation is the protection of 
                     public health. Marketing authorisations for medicinal products are dynamic and not 
                     static and the dossier underlying a marketing authorisation must be regularly updated 
                     in  order  to  ensure  that  scientific  progress  and  new  regulatory  requirements  are 
                     respected,  in  accordance  with  Article  23  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  Annex  I  to 
                     Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In particular, 
                     any information which may influence the evaluation of the benefits and the risks of 
                     the  medicinal  product  must  be  promptly  supplied.  In  this  regard,  marketing 
                     authorisation holders of marketing authorisations granted in accordance with Article 
                     10 or 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC should introduce variations swiftly whenever the 
                     marketing  authorisation  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  or  of  the  "original" 
                     medicinal product is changed to address a safety or efficacy concern. 
                     In  addition,  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  should  inform  the  competent 
                     authorities relating to any pharmacovigilance concerns according to Article 104 of 
                     Directive 2001/83/EC. 
                     5.1.2   Standardised nomenclatures and quality standards 
                     The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) of the Council of 
                     Europe  provides  standardised  nomenclatures  and  quality  standards  for  medicinal 
                     substances and products, which are published in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
                     5.1.3   Standard Terms 
                     The standard terms for pharmaceutical forms, routes of administration and containers 
                     are contained in the “List of Standard Terms for pharmaceutical dosage forms, routes 
                     of  administration  and  containers”  published  by  the  European  Directorate  for  the 
                     Quality of Medicines (EDQM) of the Council of Europe.  
                     5.1.4   Evaluation of the potential environmental risk 
                     Article  8(3)(ca)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  requires  the  evaluation  of  the  potential 
                     environmental risks posed by the medicinal product. In fulfilling this requirement, all 
                     applicants/marketing  authorisation  holders  should  take  into  account  the  CHMP 
                     Guideline  ‘On  Environmental  Risk  Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
                     Use’                                       available                                       at 
                                                                  28

                  5.2    Applications according to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
                  5.2.1 Stand alone application 
                  An application for marketing authorisation must be accompanied by the particulars 
                  and documents set out in Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC and therefore the 
                  following documentation must be included in the dossier: 
                        pharmaceutical (physico-chemical, biological or microbiological) tests, 
                        preclinical (toxicological and pharmacological) tests, 
                        clinical trials. 
                  For such applications, the relevant published literature also has to be submitted and 
                  these scientific publications can be used as supportive data. 
                  5.2.2 "Mixed application" 
                  Where Module 4 and/or 5 of the application for marketing authorisation consists of a 
                  combination of reports of limited non-clinical and/or clinical studies carried out by the 
                  applicant and of bibliographical references  this kind of application has also to be 
                  submitted according to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. See also Annex I to 
                  Directive 2001/83/EC, section 7 on mixed marketing authorisation application. 
                  5.3    Applications according to Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC 
                  5.3.1 General concepts 
                  5.3.1.1 Reference medicinal product   
                  For data exclusivity and market protection period of the reference medicinal product, 
                  see section 6.  
                  A definition of reference medicinal product is given in Article 10(2)(a) of Directive 
                  2001/83/EC, which provides that the reference medicinal product means a medicinal 
                  product authorised under Article 6, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8. 
                  Article 6 lays down the principle that no medicinal product may be placed on the 
                  market of a Member State unless a marketing authorisation has been issued. In turn, 
                  Article 8 provides that in order to obtain a marketing authorisation an application 
                  must be made to the competent authority by an applicant established in the Union and 
                  containing the particulars and documents listed in that provision.  
                  Besides,  Article  6(1)  contains  the  notion  of  global  marketing  authorisation  as  the 
                  initial  marketing  authorisation  and  any  additional  strengths,  pharmaceutical  forms, 
                  administration routes or presentations, as well as any variations and extensions. Each 
                                                        29 
                                                           
             
            product within the global marketing authorisation may be chosen as the reference 
            medicinal product.  
            Reference can be made to the dossier of a reference medicinal product for which a 
            marketing authorisation has been granted in the Union in accordance with Articles 
                 27
            8(3), 10a , 10b or 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC. The application form in Module 1 of 
            the dossier for an Article 10 application should clearly identify the reference product 
            in  order  for  the  reference  Member  State,  in  case  of  MRP/DCP,  to  prepare  the 
            assessment report. 
            In  addition,  marketing  authorisations  granted  under  exceptional  circumstances  in 
            accordance  with  Article  14(8)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  or  Article  22  of 
            Directive 2001/83/EC can be used as a reference medicinal product provided that all 
            other requirements for granting a generic marketing authorisation under Article 10 are 
            fulfilled. Such generic marketing authorisation is normally not granted under Article 
            14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or Article 22 of Directive 2001/83/EC but any 
            specific  obligation  imposed  on  the  reference  medicinal  product  which  is  deemed 
            appropriate also for the generic product should be imposed also as a condition to the 
            generic  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  annual  review  where  appropriate.  The 
            decision  on  the  imposition  or  not  of  any  obligations  of  the  reference  medicinal 
            product on the generic should be made on a case-by-case basis, it should follow the 
            principles  applied  for  generics  of  medicinal  products  for  which  conditions  to  the 
            marketing authorisation have been imposed and it should fully take into account that 
            the reference medicinal product is authorised under exceptional circumstances and 
            that particulars of that reference medicinal product are as yet inadequate in certain 
            specified respects. In this regard, it is recalled that the primary purpose of the specific 
            obligations is to mitigate public health risk following from an authorisation based on 
            less than comprehensive data. The Product Information should also draw the attention 
            of the medical practitioners to the fact that the product refers to a reference medicinal 
            product  authorised  under  exceptional  circumstances  and  that  particulars  of  that 
            reference medicinal product are as yet inadequate in certain specified respects. 
            If  during  the  lifecycle  of  the  generic  product  it  is  confirmed  that  the  risk-benefit 
            balance  of  the  reference  medicinal  product  authorised  under  exceptional 
            circumstances  is  not  favourable  and  the  marketing  authorisation  of  that  reference 
            medicinal product is withdrawn, suspended or revoked, the same action would be 
            required  also  towards  the  generic  medicinal  products  of  that  reference  medicinal 
            product. 
             
            On the contrary, reference cannot be made to the dossier of a medicinal product for 
            which a marketing authorisation has been granted in the Union in accordance with 
            Article  10(1).Data  supporting  applications  approved  under  Article  10(3)  (e.g  new 
            indications,  strength,  route  of  administration,  pharmaceutical  form)  do  not  benefit 
            from periods of exclusivity, except when specifically provided for new therapeutic 
            indications  in  Article  10(5).  For  example,  Product  B  (Company  2)  was  approved 
            according to Article 10(3) based on additional preclinical and/or clinical studies (e.g. 
            supporting a new indication, strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration) 
            to those submitted in support of the reference product (Product A, Company 1).  A 
                                                             
            27
              Case C-104-13, ECJ 23/10/2014  
                                     30 
                                       
             
            subsequent application may be submitted for Product C (Company 3), which refers to 
            data supporting the reference product (Product A) and also to the data submitted in 
            support of Product B (approved according to Article 10(3)), provided that any data 
            exclusivity awarded in respect of a possible new therapeutic indication for Product B 
            has elapsed. The application for Product C may be accepted irrespective of whether 
            Products A and B belong to the same global marketing authorisation. In such case 
            Product A would be the reference medicinal product in support of the application for 
            Product  C.  Applicants  proposing  such  a  marketing  authorisation  application  are 
            advised to contact the competent authorities in advance of the submission.   
            Reference must be made to a product which is or has been authorised in the Union, 
            (i.e. a marketing authorisation has been granted for the reference medicinal product, 
                                                      28
            but it may have ceased to exist) and in accordance with the Union law .  
            In case, the reference medicinal product is no more produced and placed on the Union 
            market , demonstration of the bioequivalence with the reference medicinal product 
            through bioavailability studies should however be performed on batches which have 
            been authorised within the Union.  
            Application in accordance with Article 10 refers to information that is contained in 
            the dossier of the authorisation of the reference product. This information is generally 
            not  completely  available  in  the  public  domain.  These  authorisations  for  these 
            medicinal products are therefore linked to the ‘original’ authorisation. This does not 
            however mean that withdrawal of the authorisation for the reference product leads to 
            the  withdrawal  of  the  authorisation  for  the  generic  product.  However,  where  the 
            reference  medicinal  product  has  been  withdrawn,  it  is  noted  that  public  health 
            concerns linked for instance to the lack of pharmacovigilance data may prevent the 
            granting of such marketing authorisation.  (case C-223/01, AstraZeneca, judgment of 
            the European Court of Justice of 16 October 2003).  
            An  application  according  to  Article  10  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  cannot  be  filed 
            simultaneously  with  an  application  for  a  reference  product   (case  C-223/01, 
            AstraZeneca, judgment of the European Court of Justice of 16 October 2003).  
            The marketing authorisation holder of the reference medicinal product can file an 
            application on the basis of Article 10 to his own medicinal product, provided that the 
            requirements of Article 10 are fulfilled, for example the data exclusivity period has 
            expired. It should be noted that in case of centralised application, Article 82(1) of 
            Regulation 726/2004 applies (see section 2.7) For National/DC/MR procedures, see 
            section 2.7.  
            5.3.1.2 “European reference medicinal product” 
            According to Article 10(1), third subparagraph of Directive 2001/83/EC a generic 
            application can also be submitted in a Member State although the reference medicinal 
            product has never been authorised in that Member State. In that case, a reference 
                                                             
            28
              Case C-527/07, ECJ 18/06/2009 
                                     31 
                                       
                          
                         medicinal  product  in  another  Member  State  should  be  identified,  so-called  the 
                         European reference medicinal product. 
                         In these cases, the applicant has to identify in the application form the name of the 
                         Member State in which the reference medicinal product is or has been authorised. It is 
                         also a prerequisite that the period of data exclusivity has expired in the Member State 
                         of the reference medicinal product (see section 6). 
                         At  the  request  of  the  competent  authority  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the 
                         application is submitted, the competent authority of the other Member State should 
                         transmit, within a period of one month, a confirmation that the reference medicinal 
                         product is or has been authorised together with the full composition of the reference 
                         product and if necessary other relevant documentation. 
                         The documentation requested must be relevant for the assessment of the application 
                         submitted on the basis of Article 10 (see CMD(h) working document - information to 
                         be submitted by the Member State of the European reference medicinal product at 
                         http://www.hma.eu/uploads/media/ERP_information.pdf) 
                         5.3.1.3 Reference medicinal product not harmonised in the European Union 
                         For historical reasons, the reference product identified in the procedure may have 
                         marketing authorisations with different SmPC across the EU (horizontal disharmony 
                         of  the  reference  medicinal  product).  This  should  not  prevent  that  the  medicinal 
                         product authorised on the basis of Article 10 has the same SmPC across the EU 
                         (horizontal  harmonisation  of  the  generic  medicinal  product).  Concerned  Member 
                         States  should  endeavour  to  recognise  the  assessment  performed  by  the  Reference 
                         Member State, except where they have concerns as to the existence of a potential 
                         serious risk for public health as regards the content of application considered.  
                          
                         5.3.2 Particularities for application according to Article 10 
                         Article 10 constitutes a single legal base for the submission of applications.  The 
                         content of such applications must comply with the requirements set out therein.   
                         5.3.2.1 Application  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  Article  10  (generic 
                                   medicinal product) 
                         Directive 2001/83/EC defines a generic medicinal product in Article 10(2)(b) as a 
                         medicinal product which has:  
                                  the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances as the 
                                   reference medicinal product, 
                                  the same pharmaceutical form as the reference medicinal product, 
                                  and  whose  bioequivalence  with  the  reference  medicinal  product  has  been 
                                   demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies.  
                                                                                 32 
                                                                                   
             
            The  different  salts,  esters,  ethers,  isomers,  mixtures  of  isomers,  complexes  or 
            derivatives of an active substance must be considered to be the same active substance, 
            unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy. In 
            such cases, additional information providing proof of the safety and/or efficacy of the 
            various salts, esters, ethers, isomers or mixtures thereof or derivatives of an authorised 
            active  substance  must  be  supplied  by  the  applicant.  If  additional  information 
            concerning changes to the nature of the active substance cannot establish the absence 
            of a significant difference with regard to safety or efficacy then it would be necessary 
            to submit the results of appropriate pre-clinical tests and clinical trials in accordance 
            with the requirements of Article 10(3) (see section 5.3.5). To the extent that the active 
            substance may be considered as a new active substance as defined in Annex I at the 
            end of this Chapter, the applicant may consider the submission of an application in 
            accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
            The various immediate-release oral pharmaceutical forms are considered to be one 
            and the same pharmaceutical form. Bioavailability studies need not be required of the 
            applicant if he can demonstrate that the generic medicinal product meets the relevant 
            criteria as defined in the detailed 'guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence' 
            29
             (see also Annex I of this Chapter).  
            The competent authorities will determine the validity of such applications on a case 
            by case basis and will rely upon the summary evidence provided in Modules 1 and 2 
            of  the  application  dossier  and,  if  available,  on  the  assessment  report  of  another 
            competent authority. 
            ‘Same qualitative and quantitative composition’ 
            This requirement that the generic and reference products have the same qualitative 
            and quantitative composition extends only to the active substance(s) and not to the 
            other ingredients of the product. However, differences in excipient composition or 
            differences in impurities must not lead to significant differences as regards safety and 
            efficacy. The competent authorities will evaluate these differences in the light of all 
            scientific knowledge at their disposal. See also ruling of the European Court of Justice 
            in case C-74/03, Smithkline Beecham, judgment of 20 January 2005. 
            The decision whether a different form of the active substance is to be regarded as a 
            new active substance should be taken by the competent authorities on a case-by-case 
            basis.

                   ‘Same pharmaceutical form’ 
                   This criterion relating to the same pharmaceutical form contained in the definition of 
                   generic medicinal product is evaluated taking into consideration the standard terms 
                   for  pharmaceutical  dosage  forms  established  by  the  European  Pharmacopoeia.  A 
                   generic  product  and  a  reference  product  may  be  considered  to  have  the  same 
                   pharmaceutical form if they have the same form of administration as defined by the 
                   Pharmacopoeia. Furthermore, Article 10(2)(b) of the amended Directive provides that 
                   the various immediate release oral forms, which would include tablets, capsules, oral 
                   solutions and suspensions, are considered to be the same pharmaceutical form for the 
                   purposes of Article 10. 
                   According to the European Court of Justice, in determining the pharmaceutical form 
                   of a medicinal product, account must be taken of the form in which it is presented and 
                   the form in which it is administered, including the physical form. In that context, 
                   medicinal products which are presented in the form of a solution to be mixed in a 
                   drink for administration to the patient, and which after mixing form different solutions 
                   to be administrated, as for example a macroemulsion and a microemulsion, are to be 
                   treated as having the same pharmaceutical form, provided that the differences in the 
                   form of administration are not significant in scientific terms. (See Case C-106/01, 
                   Novartis, judgment of 29 April 2004). 
                    ‘Bioequivalence’  
                   The definition and demonstration of bioequivalence should be made in accordance 
                   with  the  CHMP  'guidelines  on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence'  available  at 
                   http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2010/
                   01/WC500070039.pdf 
                   Article  10(2)b  last  sentence  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  states:  "[…]Bioavailability 
                   studies need not be required of the applicant if he can demonstrate that the generic 
                   medicinal product meets the relevant criteria as  defined in the appropriate detailed 
                   guidelines".   
                   Such exemptions from the need to demonstrate bioequivalence should be justified in 
                   module 1 of the dossier and in the clinical overviews.  
                   Where bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability studies Article 
                   10(3) requires that the results of appropriate pre-clinical tests or clinical trials will be 
                   provided. 
                   5.3.2.2 Application   in   accordance  with  paragraph  3  of  Article  10 
                          ("hybrid"medicinal product)  
                   Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC requires that, in certain circumstances in the 
                   framework of  an  application  under  Article  10,  the  results  of  the  appropriate  pre-
                   clinical tests or clinical trials shall be provided.  These applications will thus rely in 
                   part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for a reference product and in 
                   part on new data.  
                                                            34 
                                                              
                      
                     The extent of the additional studies required in the framework of an article 10(3) 
                     application  depends  on  the  changes  introduced  vis-à-vis  the  reference  medicinal 
                     product (e.g. new strength, new route of administration, new therapeutic indication) 
                     and will be a matter of scientific assessment by the relevant competent authority.  
                     In such cases the results of tests and trials supplied must be consistent with the data 
                     content standards required in the Annex to the Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by 
                     Directive 2003/63/EC.   
                     Article  10(3)  considers  three  circumstances  where  such  additional  data  will  be 
                     necessary: 
                            where the strict definition of a ‘generic medicinal product’ is not met; 
                            where bioavailability studies cannot be used to demonstrate bioequivalence 
                             (for  example  where  the  new  product  is  supra-bioavailable  or  for  locally 
                             applied/locally acting medicinal products); 
                            where there are changes in the active substance(s), therapeutic indications, 
                             strength, pharmaceutical form or route of administration of the generic product 
                             compared to the reference product. 
                     Some guidance on the appropriate additional studies required is indicated in the table 
                     given in Annex II at the end of this Chapter. 
                     5.3.2.3 Application  in  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  Article  10  ("  Similar 
                             biological medicinal product")   
                     Article  10(4)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  requires  that  in  the  framework  of  an 
                     application under Article 10, where a biological medicinal product which is similar to 
                     a  reference  biological  product,  does  not  meet  the  conditions  in  the  definition  of 
                     generic  medicinal  products,  owing  to,  in  particular,  differences  relating  to  raw 
                     materials  or  differences  in  manufacturing  processes  of  the  similar  biological 
                     medicinal  product  and  the  reference  biological  medicinal  product,  the  results  of 
                     appropriate  pre-clinical  tests  or  clinical  trials  relating  to  these  conditions  must  be 
                     provided. The type and quantity of supplementary data to be provided must comply 
                     with the relevant criteria stated in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC and the related 
                     detailed guidelines. The results of other tests and trials from the reference medicinal 
                     product's dossier must not be provided. Guidance is available at the website of the 
                     EMA http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
                     With  the  aim  of  facilitating  the  global  development  of  biosimilars  and  to  avoid 
                     unnecessary  repetition  of  clinical  trials,  it  may  be  possible  for  an  Applicant  to 
                     compare the biosimilar in certain clinical studies and in vivo non-clinical studies with 
                     a non-EEA authorised comparator which will need to be authorised by a regulatory 
                     authority with similar scientific and regulatory standards as EMA or EEA competent 
                     authorities  (e.g.  ICH  members).  It  will  be  the  Applicant’s  responsibility  to 
                     demonstrate that the comparator authorised outside the EEA is representative of the 
                     reference product authorised in the EEA. For further information, please refer to the 
                                                                   35

                  5.4    Applications according to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC 
                  According to Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC it is possible to replace results of 
                  the  pre-clinical  and  clinical  trials  by  detailed  references  to  published  scientific 
                  literature if it can be demonstrated that the active substances of a medicinal product in 
                  the claimed therapeutic indication have been in well-established medicinal use within 
                  the Union for at least ten years, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of 
                  safety. In this regard, the provisions of Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply.    
                  Being a derogation the well-established use provision must be interpreted strictly. The 
                  well-established medicinal use legal basis is to be used only in cases where all aspects 
                  of  the  safety  and  efficacy  are  demonstrated  by  reference  to  published  scientific 
                  literature. It would derive that it should not be considered as an alternative to other 
                  legal  basis  such  as  Article  10  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  The  adequacy  of  the 
                  bibliographic evidence has to be assessed on a case by case basis in the understanding 
                  that  applications  under  Article  10a  does  not  lower  the  requirements  of  safety  and 
                  efficacy that must be met. 
                  Well-established medicinal use 
                  Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC lays down specific rules for the demonstration of a 
                  well-established medicinal use, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of 
                  safety.  
                  The following criteria should be taken into account:  
                        the time over which a substance has been used with regular application in 
                         patients; quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, taking into account 
                         the extent to which the substance has been used in practice, the extent of use 
                         on a geographical basis and the extent to which the use of the substance has 
                         been monitored by pharmacovigilance or other methods; 
                        the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance (reflected in the 
                         published scientific literature) and the coherence of scientific assessments; 
                  Therefore,  different  periods  of  time  may  be  necessary  for  establishing  well-
                  established use of different substances. In any case, the period of time required for 
                  establishing a well-established medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product 
                  must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and documented use of that 
                  substance as a medicinal product in the Union. 
                  Evidence must be supplied to demonstrate the systematic and documented use of the 
                  active substance, i.e. extensive and continued use over a period of at least 10 years in 
                  the Union. Although “medicinal use” does not exclusively mean “use as an authorised 
                  medicinal product”, it could constitute a proof of medicinal use. In particular, for 
                  active  substance  used  in  medicinal  products  authorised  before  a  State  joined  the 
                  Union or before an authorisation of a Member State was reviewed in accordance with 
                                                        36 
                                                           
           
          Union law; the use on that territory is to be taken into account for the purpose of 
          application of Article 10a, even if it has partly or fully occurred before the accession 
          of that State. 
          Well-established use refers to the use for a specific therapeutic use. If well-known 
          substances are used for entirely new therapeutic indications andit is not possible to 
          solely  refer  to  a  well-established  use,  then  additional  data  on  the  new  therapeutic 
          indication  together  with  appropriate  pre-clinical  and  human  safety  and/or  efficacy 
          data should be provided. In such a case, another legal basis should be used for the 
          marketing authorisation application. 
          Whilst data concerning use in clinical trials, compassionate use, named patient supply 
          may be submitted, this cannot replace the requirement to demonstrate a systematic 
          and  documented  use  for  that  10  year  period  in  the  Union.  Where  relevant,  the 
          prevalence of the condition/disease should be taken into account when demonstrating 
          the extent of use. 
          In case of orphan marketing authorisation application the systematic and documented 
          use of a substance can refer, as way of derogation, to the use of that substance in 
          accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
          Marketing authorisation applications for fixed combinations intended to be used in 
          patients who are already stabilised on optimal doses of the combination of the same, 
          but separately administered, active substances, taken at the same dose interval and 
          time,  can  be  submitted  on  the  basis  of  Article  10a.  In  such  cases,  the  detailed 
          references to published scientific literature submitted must concern the systematic and 
          documented use of the active substances in combination. It is nevertheless possible to 
          include information on the individual active substances in the application. This will 
          typically occur where the applicant intends to justify the absence of certain specific 
          data on the combination by reference to the information available on the individual 
          substances. 
          Lastly, consideration must be given to the case of herbal medicinal products, which 
          apart from registration can be authorised on the basis of, inter alia, Article 10a of 
          Directive 2001/83/EC. The existence of a EU herbal monograph for herbal substances 
          or herbal preparations with well-established use is considered as demonstrating the 
          systematic use.  
          Documentation  
          The applicant is encouraged to provide a detailed description of the strategy used for 
          the search of published literature and the justification for inclusion of references in the 
          application. The reference must be made to ‘published scientific literature’. The term 
          ‘published’  literature  implies  that  the  text  must  be  freely  available  in  the  public 
          domain and published by a reputable source, preferably peer-reviewed. See section 
          6.1.6. 
          It  must  be  stressed  that  assessment  reports  such  as  the  EPAR  for  EU  marketing 
          authorisations  or  similar  summary  reports  from  competent  authorities  inside  and 
          outside  the  EU  which  are  made  publicly  available  by  competent  authorities  for 
                              37 
                                
                   
                  reasons of transparency cannot be considered to meet the requirements of Annex I of 
                  Directive 2001/83/EC. 
                  The  documentation  and  the  Overall  summaries  and  Overall  overview/summaries 
                  submitted  by  the  applicant  should  cover  all  aspects  of  the  assessment  and  must 
                  include a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post-marketing 
                  studies  and  published  scientific  literature  concerning  experience  in  the  form  of 
                  epidemiological studies and in particular of comparative epidemiological studies. All 
                  documentation,  both  favourable  and  unfavourable,  should  be  communicated.  If 
                  documentation is lacking, a justification should be given. If parts of the dossier are 
                  incomplete,  particular  attention  must  be  paid  to  explain  in  the  Overall 
                  overview/summaries why.  
                  When compiling published scientific literature, Applicants should also include post-
                  marketing experience with medicinal products containing the same active substance . 
                  Copies  of  the  full  text  of  the  literature,  including  necessary  translations  must  be 
                  submitted. 
                  Scientific monographs may offer an overview on published scientific literature which 
                  - together with the full texts referred to - may be used in addition to other documents 
                  for a bibliographical application. These monographs can help to avoid duplication of 
                  work and bring about gradual harmonisation in the evaluation of medicinal products. 
                  In the specific case of herbal medicinal products, if an EU herbal monograph for well 
                  establish use exists the submission of non-clinical and clinical overview/summaries is 
                  necessary to explain the relevance of the monograph and/or additional literature for 
                  the given application. However, it is not necessary to provide all the articles referred 
                  in the List of References supporting the monograph. 
                  In  certain  cases,  studies  may  be  provided  only  to  support  the  relevance  of  the 
                  literature (used to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the active substance(s)), to the 
                  product intended for marketing. These are considered on a case by case basis by the 
                  competent authorities. 
                  5.5    Application according to Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EEC  
                  In accordance with Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC: "In the case of medicinal 
                  products containing active substances used in the composition of authorised medicinal 
                  products but not hitherto used in combination for therapeutic purposes, the results of 
                  new  pre-clinical  tests  or  new  clinical  trials  relating  to  that  combination  must  be 
                  provided  in  accordance  with  Article  8(3)(i),  but  it  is  not  necessary  to  provide 
                  scientific references relating to each individual active substance". 
                  The  combination  of  active  substances  within  a  single  pharmaceutical  form  of 
                  administration according to this provision is a so-called ‘fixed combination’. 
                  A key principle of the acquis is that there must be a marketing authorisation for each 
                  medicinal product that is put on the EU market. Therefore, the fixed combination 
                  definition is limited to active substances contained in a same pharmaceutical form of 
                                                        38 
                                                           
                              
                             administration,  the  so-called  'fixed-combination'.  The  combination  of  active 
                             substances, where active substances are included in separate pharmaceutical forms 
                             and presented in a combination pack cannot be considered as fixed combination. 
                             In very exceptional circumstances, which must be considered on a case by case basis, 
                             the  marketing  of  distinct  medicinal  products  in  the  same  package  may  be 
                             indispensable  for  public  health  reasons.  Such  reasons  cannot  be  related  to 
                             convenience or commercial purposes.  
                              
                             Marketing  authorisations  for  medicinal  products  containing  more  than  one  active 
                             substance in a single pharmaceutical form can be granted on different legal basis. In 
                             case  of  an  application  on  the  basis  of  Article  10b  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  the 
                             applicant does not have to provide scientific references relating to each individual 
                             active substance.  
                             For impact on the global marketing authorisations as described in Article 6(1) of 
                             Directive 2001/83/EC see section 2.3.  
                             Applications  for  fixed-combination  medicinal  products  under  Article  10b  are 
                             conditioned  to  the  fact  that  the  individual  substances  have  been  the  object  of  a 
                             marketing authorisation in the EEA via a Union or national procedure, even though it 
                             is not in the same Member State. 
                             It follows from the wording of Article 10b as well as from Part II.5 of Annex I to 
                             Directive 2001/83/EC that a full dossier comprising all the information of modules 1 
                             to 5 has to be provided in relation to the fixed-combination. The guideline on clinical 
                                                                                                                   30
                             development of fixed combination medicinal products  provides  guidance on the 
                             clinical elements of such dossier. As with any application for a new medicinal product 
                             such a full dossier can be either a dossier based solely on own pre-clinical tests and/or 
                             clinical trials or on a mixed dossier taking into account data exclusivity rules.  
                             Article 10b does not contain a requirement for the inclusion of data on the individual 
                             active substances. It is nevertheless possible to include information on the individual 
                             substances in the application for a fixed-combination. This will typically occur where 
                             the applicant tries to justify the absence of certain specific data on the combination by 
                             reference to the information available on the individual substances. Such information 
                             could consist of literature or actual data.  
                             In case the dossier is only composed of references to published scientific literature, 
                             the legal basis would not be Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC, but possibly 10a if 
                             all requirements are fulfilled (see section 5.4).  
                             5.6        Applications according to Article 10c of Directive 2001/83 /EC  
                             A derogation  from  the  requirements  to  submit  all  of  the  information  required  in 
                             Article  8(3)(i)  is  provided  by  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  for  so-called 
                             ‘informed  consent’  marketing  authorisation  applications.  Despite  the  fact  that  the

                                    DRAFT  Guideline            on    clinical    development        of    fixed     combination       medicinal      products 
                                   http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2015/05/WC500186840.pdf 
                                                                                             39 
                                                                                                
                      
                     provision  contains  some  criteria  that  are  common  to  the  definition  of  a  generic 
                     medicinal  product  in  Article  10,  Article  10c  does  not  concern  generic  medicinal 
                     products. 
                     According to Article 10c: “Following the granting of a marketing authorisation, the 
                     authorisation holder may allow use to be made of the pharmaceutical, preclinical and 
                     clinical documentation contained in the file on the medicinal product, with a view to 
                     examining subsequent applications relating to other medicinal products possessing the 
                     same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances and the 
                     same pharmaceutical form.”  
                     As Article 11 of Directive 2001/83/EC refers only to application on the basis of 
                     Article  10,  an  informed  consent  application  does  not  have  to  cover  all 
                     presentations/indications of the medicinal product with regard to which consent is 
                     given. Consent may be given to use the documentation contained in the file of the 
                     relevant  medicinal  product  for  a  given  presentation/indication  provided  that  the 
                     application relies on that consent as regards all three modules of the dossier. It is a 
                     prerequisite for the use of article 10c that consent has been obtained for all three 
                     modules containing the pharmaceutical, preclinical and clinical data. It is not possible 
                     to use Article 10c a legal basis for an application consisting of the applicant’s own 
                     module 3 and for which consent has been given for modules 4 and 5. In such cases the 
                     legal basis for the application is Article 8(3).  
                     An informed consent application cannot cover more presentations or indications that 
                     the medicinal product with regard to which consent is given.  
                      
                     The concept of "European reference medicinal product" is laid down by Article 10 
                     and is applicable in case of application in accordance with Article 10 (see section 
                     5.3.1.2). It does not apply in the context of applications under Article 10c. In addition, 
                     it should be noted that an informed consent application is only possible if there is still 
                     a valid marketing authorisation to which consent is given.  
                     Furthermore, informed consent applications need to respect the following: 
                            for a central marketing authorisation the informed consent application has to 
                             follow the centralised procedure; 
                            for a national marketing authorisation the informed consent application has to 
                             follow  a  national  procedure  (either  pure  national  or  MRP  or  DCP).  A 
                             prerequisite is,  that the marketing authorisation is granted in this/these MS. 
                      
                     It follows that an application under Article 10c can only be submitted to a Member 
                     State where the medicinal product with regard to which consent is given is authorised. 
                     The  applicant  must  show  proof  that  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  of  the 
                     reference product has consented that the dossier of that product is used for the purpose 
                     of examining the application in question. It is up to the contracting parties to consider, 
                     as  a  term  of  their  contractual  agreement,  whether  the  ‘informed  consent’  can  be 
                     withdrawn by the consenting parties and what the consequences of the withdrawal of 
                     the informed consent would be. 
                                                                   40 
                                                                     
           
          The  ‘informed  consent’  product  applicant  must  have  permanent  access  to  the 
          documentation in order to fully carry out his responsibilities. For the  information 
          contained in the Active Substance Master File a new letter of access in connection 
          with the informed consent application should be included, without prejudice to the 
          restrictions on access to the Manufacturer Restricted Part of the Active Substance 
          Master File. 
          For  competent  authorities,  demonstration  of  the  ‘informed  consent’  is  a  formal 
          condition  which  must  be  fulfilled,  when  the  informed  consent  application  is 
          submitted. An authenticated letter from the party granting consent is required and 
          must  specify  the  name  of  the  benefiting  party  and  the  products  concerned.  The 
          withdrawal of the informed consent at a later stage has no direct consequences on the 
          existence/validity  of  the  marketing  authorisation,  but  the  marketing  authorisation 
          holder is to take appropriate steps having regard to the requirement of permanent 
          access to the file.

                     6.    DATA EXCLUSIVITY AND MARKET PROTECTION   
                    6.1    Data exclusivity and market protection period for reference 
                    medicinal products 
                     
                    6.1.1 Principles on data exclusivity and market protection of 'reference medicinal 
                    product' 
                     
                    The medicinal product, once authorised on the basis of Article 10, can however only 
                    be  placed  on  the  market  10  or  11  years  after  the  authorisation  of  the  reference 
                    medicinal product, depending on the protection period applicable for the reference 
                    medicinal product. The protection period in the concerned Member State must also be 
                    taken into consideration before placing the medicinal product on its market.   
                    It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  these  periods  of  protection  will  only  apply  to 
                    applications  for  reference  medicinal  products  submitted  once  the  provisions  of 
                    Directive 2004/27/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 start to apply; see section 
                    6.1.2.  
                    6.1.2  Data exclusivity and market protection for applications submitted after 
                           the implementation of the amended legislation 
                    Directive  2004/27/EC,  amending  Directive  2001/83/EC,  and  Regulation  (EC)  No 
                    726/2004  have  introduced  new  rules  concerning  the  periods,  from  the  initial 
                    marketing  authorisation  of  the  reference  product,  during  which  generic  product 
                    applicants cannot rely on the dossier of the reference product for the purposes of 
                    submitting an application, obtaining marketing authorisation or placing the product on 
                    the market. 
                    For products authorised by the national competent authorities, according to the first 
                    subparagraph  of  Article  10(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended  by  Directive 
                    2004/27/EC, the applicant is not required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests 
                    and of clinical trials if he can demonstrate that the medicinal product is a generic of a 
                    reference medicinal product which is or has been authorised under Article 6 for not 
                    less than eight years in a Member State or in the Union. 
                    According to the second subparagraph of Article 10(1), generic products authorised in 
                    this way must not be placed on the market until ten years have elapsed from the initial 
                    authorisation  of  the  reference  product.  (This  ten  year  period  may  be  extended  to 
                    eleven if the conditions of the fourth subparagraph of Article 10(1) are fulfilled, see 
                    section 6.2 below). 
                    The period of eight years from initial authorisation of the reference product provides a 
                    period  of  so-called  “data  exclusivity”,  after  which  valid  applications  for  generic 
                    products can be submitted and lead to the granting of a marketing authorisation. The 
                    period  of  ten  years  from  initial  authorisation  of  the  reference  product  provides  a 
                    period of so-called “market protection” after which generic products authorised in this 
                    way can be placed on the market. 
                                                               42 
                                                                 
                          
                         The same periods of protection apply in the case of centrally authorised products 
                         pursuant to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
                         These periods of data exclusivity and market protection according to Article 10(1) of 
                         Directive 2001/83/EC and Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 are being 
                         applied  separately  and  independently  from  the  periods  of  market  exclusivity 
                         according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and the protection provided 
                         has a different scope. According to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, subject 
                         to the exceptions and derogations set out in that Article, the competent authorities 
                         shall  not  for  a  period  of  10  years  accept  another  application  for  a  marketing 
                         authorisation or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorisation, 
                         for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. This is 
                         applicable regardless of whether the subsequent application is submitted on the basis 
                         of Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC or any other legal basis. 
                         6.1.3 Data exclusivity and market protection for applications submitted before 
                                   the implementation of the amended legislation 
                         According  to  Article  89  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  new  periods  of 
                         protection do not apply to those reference medicinal products for which the initial 
                         application for authorisation was submitted before 20 November 2005.  
                         Equally, Directive 2004/27/EC makes it clear in Article 2 that the new periods of 
                         protection do not apply to those reference medicinal products for which an application 
                         for authorisation has been submitted before the date of transposition referred to in 
                         Article 3 of the same legal text (i.e. 30 October 2005). 
                         Products for which the initial submission was made prior to the dates referred above 
                         continue to benefit from the previous periods of protection (except in Croatia where 
                         the new periods of protection apply for all products)  which are: 
                                  10 years for national authorisations granted by the following Member States: 
                                   Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom, 
                                   Luxemburg; 
                                  6 years for national authorisations granted by the following Member States: 
                                   Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Poland, Czech 
                                   Republic,  Hungary,  Lithuania,  Latvia,  Slovenia,  Slovakia,  Malta,  Estonia, 
                                   Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania and also Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland; 
                                  10  years  for  all  medicinal  products  authorised  through  the  centralised 
                                   procedure; 
                                  10 years for all medicinal products authorised following an opinion of the 
                                   CPMP in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 87/22/EEC (ex-concertation 
                                   procedure). 
                         For  the  purposes  of  the  application  of  the  mentioned  provisions,  the  date  of 
                         submission  of  an  application,  and  not  the  date  of  validation  by  the  competent 
                         authority, determines the periods of protection applicable. 
                                                                                 43 
                                                                                   
                      
                     Evidence of the date of authorisation of the reference product should be provided 
                     where possible in the application for the generic marketing authorisation. 
                     In  mutual  recognition  or  decentralised  procedures  if  the  protection  period  in  a 
                     concerned  Member  State  is  longer  than  in  the  reference  Member  State,  mutual 
                     recognition in the concerned Member State is not possible before the expiry of the 
                     longer period. 
                     The  data  exclusivity  rules  applicable  before  adoption  of  the  current  legislation 
                     allowed the coexistence of periods of six and ten  years of protection in different 
                     Member States  for  the  same  product.  In  other  words,  the  generic  of  a  reference 
                     product  was  allowed  access  to  the  market  at  different  points  in  time  in  different 
                     Member States.  
                     The new harmonised data exclusivity and market protection periods in Article 10(1) 
                     of Directive 2001/83/EC do not apply retroactively.  It follows that: 
                      
                      
                       An application in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC can only be 
                         processed via the centralised procedure after expiry of the period of protection of  
                         the Member State where the reference medicinal product was authorised (e.g, if 
                         the reference product is  authorised in a Member State where a ten-year period of 
                         protection applies, the application under the centralised procedure may only be 
                         submitted after the 10 year period); 
                      
                       An application in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC can only be 
                         submitted under the decentralised/mutual recognition procedure after expiry of the 
                         period of protection of the reference medicinal product in the Reference Member 
                         State  and  the  Concerned  Member  States.    It  follows  that,  if  the  period  of 
                         protection in the Reference Member State and in three Concerned Member States 
                         is  six  years,  a  decentralised  procedure  to  obtain  a  marketing  authorisation  in 
                         accordance with Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC is only possible regarding 
                         these four Member States.  A mutual recognition procedure can be triggered a 
                         posteriori to cover other Concerned Member States once the protection period 
                         therein expires also. 
                      
                     6.1.4   Relevant  periods  of  protection  in  the  case  of  the  reference  medicinal 
                             product/“European Reference medicinal product” 
                     As stated above (section 5), Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC allows a generic 
                     application to be submitted only if the reference product has been authorised for a 
                     given period of time. In addition, a generic application is possible under that provision 
                     even “if the reference medicinal product was not authorised in the Member State in 
                     which application for the  generic  product  is  submitted”.  In  that  case,  a  reference 
                     product authorised in another Member State must be identified. It should be noted that 
                     the use of this provision will only be possible if the reference product is out of data 
                     exclusivity in the Member State where it is authorised. 
                     A medicinal product could be used as reference medicinal product if three cumulative 
                     conditions are met:   
                                                                  44 
                                                                    
             
                The  reference    medicinal  product  is  (or  has  been)  authorised  in  the  EU 
                (through a centralised or national procedure);  
                The reference medicinal product is or has been authorised in accordance with 
                the pharmaceutical acquis,  
                The relevant data exclusivity period has expired. 
            Therefore, the starting date for calculating the data exclusivity period is  the date of 
            authorisation in accordance with the pharmaceutical acquis of the reference medicinal 
            product in the territory of the European Union. The data exclusivity period must have 
            expired in the Member States concerned on the date at which the application for the 
            generic medicinal product is submitted (see in that respect section 6.1.2 and 6.1.3).  
            6.1.5.  Protection periods and global marketing authorisation 
            For  the  notion  of  global  marketing  authorisation,  see  section  2.3.  The  global 
            marketing  authorisation  contains  the  initial  authorisation  and  all  variations  and 
            extensions  thereof,  as  well  as  any  additional  strengths,  pharmaceutical  form, 
            administration  routes  or  presentations  authorised  through  separate  procedures  and 
            under a different name, granted to the marketing authorisation holder of the initial 
            authorisation.  
            In accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, all these presentations of a 
            given product are considered to be part of the same marketing authorisation for the 
            purposes of applying the rules on data exclusivity and marketing protection.  
            This means that for a reference medicinal product, the start of the data exclusivity and 
            market  protection  periods  is  the  date  when  the  first  marketing  authorisation  was 
            granted in the Union in accordance with the pharmaceutical acquis. New additional 
            strengths, pharmaceutical form, administration routes, presentations as well as any 
            variation and extensions do not restart or prolong this period. All additional strengths, 
            pharmaceutical form, administration routes, presentations as well as any variation and 
            extensions have the same end point of the data exclusivity and market protection 
            periods, namely 8 and 10 years after the first marketing authorisation was granted, 
            respectively. This will apply even if the new presentation has been authorised to the 
            same  marketing  authorisation  holder  through  a  separate  procedure,  national  or 
            centralised procedure (see section 2.3), irrespective of the legal basis and under a 
                     31
            different name .  
                                                             
            31
               Even before the adoption of Directive 2004/27/EC and the introduction of the notion of “global 
            marketing authorisation”, the European Court of Justice had interpreted the data protection provisions 
            of Directive 2001/83/EC as not affording a new period of protection to the development of an original 
            product even where the development was authorised through a separate procedure and under a different 
            name. See Case C-106/01, Novartis, judgment of 29 April 2004, where a new presentation had been 
            authorised to the same marketing authorisation holder through a separate procedure (informed consent 
            procedure, in combination with the provision of bridging data under Article 10(1)(a) last subparagraph 
            of Directive 2001/83/EC before its amendment by Directive 2004/27/EC) and under a different name. 
                                     45 
                                       
                   
                  This ten-year period can only be prolonged in the case of certain new indications, as 
                  described in section 6.2.  
                  6.1.6  Reliance  on  pre-clinical  and  clinical  data  contained  in  the  dossier  of  a 
                  reference medicinal product under data exclusivity 
                  During the period of data exclusivity of a medicinal product, the data contained in the 
                  pre-clinical and clinical file of that product and obtained through access to documents 
                  or freedom of information legislation within the EU or in third countries, cannot be 
                  relied on by other applicants or the authorities in a subsequent application to ascertain 
                  the safety and efficacy of other products.  As long as a product authorised in the EU is 
                  under  data  exclusivity,  the  reliance  on  published  or  unpublished  pre-clinical  and 
                  clinical  data  contained  in  the  dossier  of  that  product  within  the  EU  or  in  third 
                  countries by the competent authorities to grant a marketing authorisation would lead 
                  to a circumvention of the data exclusivity rules. Therefore, such application cannot be 
                  accepted.  
                   
                  6.2    Extension of the ten year period in Article 10(1) in the case of 
                  new therapeutic indications  
                  In accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
                  the ten year period of marketing protection may be extended by one year in the event 
                  of  authorisation  of  new  therapeutic  indications  representing  a  significant  clinical 
                  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing  therapies.  The  additional  year  of  marketing 
                  protection applies to the global marketing authorisation for the reference medicinal 
                  product. Generic products, with or without the new therapeutic indication, may not be 
                  placed on the market until expiry of the eleventh year.  
                  To benefit from the additional year, the new indication must be approved during the 
                  first eight years since the initial marketing authorisation has been granted. The overall 
                  period of protection cannot exceed eleven years. Therefore, this provision can be used 
                  only once per ‘global marketing authorisation’ within the meaning of Article 6(1) of 
                  Directive 2001/83/EC.  
                  Every application for a new indication must be assessed by the competent authority to 
                  determine whether the new therapeutic indication brings a significant clinical benefit 
                  in  comparison  with  existing  therapies.  In  the  case  of  products  authorised  in 
                  accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Commission decisions authorising 
                  new  therapeutic  indications  will  contain  a  clear  statement  of  whether  the  new 
                  indication  represents  a  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing 
                  therapies. In the case of medicinal products authorised through the decentralised or 
                  mutual recognition procedures, the assessment report by the reference Member State 
                  will contain a clear statement of whether the new indication represents a significant 
                  clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.  
                  This year of protection (+1) adding to the periods referred to in the previous section 
                  (8+2)  applies  only  to  those  reference  medicinal  products  for  which  the  initial 
                                                        46 
                                                           
                     
                    application for authorisation is submitted after the new rules of Directive 2004/27/EC, 
                    amending Directive 2001/83/EC, and of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 start to apply. 
                    Guidance on elements required to support the significant benefit in comparison with 
                    existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an extended 
                    (11     years)      marketing       protection      period      is     available      at 
                    http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/guideline_14-11-2007_en.pdf 
                    6.3.   One year period of protection for new indications of well-
                    established substances 
                    Article 10(5) of Directive 2001/83/EC reads: “In addition to the provisions laid down 
                    in  paragraph  1,  where  an  application  is  made  for  a  new  indication  for  a  well-
                    established substance, a non-cumulative period of one year of data exclusivity will be 
                    granted, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in 
                    relation to the new indication.” 
                     
                    For  the  purpose  of  Article  10(5)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  a  well-established 
                    substance is an active substance included in the authorised medicinal product which 
                    can be shown to have a well-established use in accordance with the requirements of 
                    indent (a) in section 1 (“Well established medicinal use”) of Part II of the Annex to 
                    Directive 20001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC. This does not however 
                    mean that the medicinal product concerned must have been authorised under the legal 
                    basis of the well-established use procedure. 
                    An applicant making reference to Article 10(5) must provide justification regarding 
                    the existence of a new indication, of a well-established substance and of significant 
                    pre-clinical  or  clinical  studies.  The  new  indication  can  be  included  either  in  the 
                    existing  marketing  authorisation  via  a  type  II  variation  or  submitted  with  an 
                    application for a new marketing authorisation. 
                     
                    The data exclusivity period is non-cumulative to other periods of protection: it refers 
                    exclusively  to  the  data  concerning  the  new  indications.  Therefore,  the  concerned 
                    medicinal product could be used as reference medicinal product with the exclusion of 
                    the indication(s) which is covered by this data exclusivity if the medicinal product 
                    fulfils the general requirements of reference medicinal product.  
                    Such data exclusivity period is an incentive for development of new indications whilst 
                    data protection would not otherwise apply. 
                    Every application for a new indication must be assessed by the competent authority to 
                    determine whether the new indication for a well-established substance is based on 
                    significant  pre-clinical  or  clinical  studies.  In  the  case  of  products  authorised  in 
                    accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Commission decisions authorising 
                    new  therapeutic  indications  for  well-established  substances  will  contain  a  clear 
                    statement of whether the new indication is based on significant preclinical or clinical 
                    studies.  In  the  case  of  medicinal  products  authorised  through  the  decentralised  or 
                    mutual recognition procedures, the assessment report by the reference Member State 
                    will contain a clear statement of whether the new indication is based on significant 
                    preclinical or clinical studies.  
                                                              47

                   6.4.   One year period of protection for data supporting a change of 
                   classification 
                   Article 74a of Directive 2001/83/EC reads: “Where a change of classification of a 
                   medicinal product has been authorised on the basis of significant pre-clinical tests or 
                   clinical trials, the competent authority shall not refer to the results of those tests or 
                   trials when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of marketing 
                   authorisation for a change of classification of the same substance for one year after 
                   the initial change was authorised.” 
                   The 1-year period of protection covers significant pre-clinical or clinical trials carried 
                   out for the purpose of substantiating an application for a change of classification. The 
                   interpretation by competent authorities of the notion of significant pre-clinical tests or 
                   clinical trials under Article 74a will be without prejudice to the interpretation of that 
                   phrase under Article 10(5).  
                   When  adopting  a  decision  authorising  a  change  of  classification  of  a  medicinal 
                   product,  the  competent  authority  must  assess  whether  the  change  is  based  on 
                   significant  preclinical  tests  or  clinical  trials.  In  the  case  of  products  authorised  in 
                   accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Commission decisions authorising a 
                   change of classification will contain a clear statement of whether the change is based 
                   on significant  preclinical  tests  or  clinical  trials.  In  the  case  of  medicinal  products 
                   authorised  by  the  Member  States,  the  decision  of  each  competent  authority 
                   authorising the change will contain a clear statement of whether the change is based 
                   on significant preclinical tests or clinical trials. 
                   A change of classification authorised after the new rules of Directive 2004/27/EC, 
                   amending Directive 2001/83/EC, and of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 start to apply 
                   may benefit from the year of protection referred to in this section.

                     7.    VARIATIONS AND EXTENSIONS  
                    Throughout the life of  a  medicinal  product,  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  is 
                    responsible for the product which is placed on the market and is also required to take 
                    into account technical and scientific progress, and to make any amendments that may 
                    be  required  to  enable  the  medicinal  product  to  be  manufactured  and  checked  by 
                    means of generally accepted scientific methods. 
                    Such amendments may involve changes to the product information or changes to the 
                    technical dossier submitted by the marketing authorisation holder. The procedures for 
                    the approval of such amendments have been set out in Commission Regulation (EC) 
                    No 1234/2008 concerning the examination of variations to the terms of marketing 
                    authorisations  for  medicinal  products  for  human  use  and  veterinary  medicinal 
                    products.  Regardless  of  the  legal  basis  of  the  initial  marketing  authorisation,  a 
                    marketing  authorisation  holder  can  submit  an  application  in  relation  to  further 
                    developments or uses of its medicinal product, including new therapeutic indications, 
                    in accordance with the provisions and requirements set out in Commission Regulation 
                    (EC) No 1234/2008 and the below mentioned Commission Guidelines. 
                    Commission Guidelines on the details of the various categories of variations, on the 
                    operation of the procedures laid down in Chapters II, IIa, III and IV of Commission 
                    Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 of 24 November 2008 concerning the examination of 
                    variations to the terms of marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human 
                    use  and  veterinary  medicinal  products  and  on  the  documentation  to  be  submitted 
                    pursuant  to  those  procedures  provide  additional  information  about  procedures  to 
                    amend marketing authorisations as well as the classification of variations. 
                    Only the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency respectively are 
                    responsible for any variations relating to centrally authorised products. 
                    Urgent safety restrictions 
                    The Variation Regulations also include provisions for the marketing authorisation 
                    holder or the competent authority to take provisional urgent safety restrictions in the 
                    event of a risk to public health.  
                    Where the marketing  authorisation  holder  takes  urgent  safety  restriction,  he  must 
                    forthwith inform the relevant national competent authority or the EMA (in the case of 
                    authorisations  granted  by  the  member  States  or  the  Union,  respectively).  If  the 
                    national competent authority/EMA has not raised any objections within 24 hours of 
                    the receipt of that information, the urgent safety restriction is deemed accepted. The 
                    corresponding variation application reflecting the urgent safety restriction  must be 
                    submitted immediately to the national competent authority/EMA and in any case no 
                    later than 15 days after the initiation of the urgent safety restriction. 
                    Where  the  national  competent  authority/Commission  imposes  provisional  urgent 
                    safety restriction, the marketing authorisation holder must be obliged to implement 
                    the urgent safety restrictions. The corresponding variation application reflecting the 
                    urgent safety restriction, must be submitted immediately to the national competent 
                                                               49 
                                                                 
                    
                   authority/EMA and in any case not later than 15 days after the initiation of the urgent 
                   safety restriction.  
                   In all cases the appropriate documentation in support of the change must be included 
                   in the application. 
                    8.     PLASMA MASTER FILE PROCEDURE AND VACCINE 
                    ANTIGEN MASTER FILE PROCEDURE  
                   The use of the Plasma Master File (PMF) and Vaccine Antigen Master File (VAMF) 
                   certification systems is optional. 
                   The PMF is a stand-alone documentation, which is  separate from  the  dossier  for 
                   marketing  authorisation.  It  provides  all  relevant  detailed  information  on  the 
                   characteristics of the entire human plasma used as a starting material and/or a raw 
                   material  for  the  manufacture  of  sub/intermediate  fractions,  constituents  of  the 
                   excipient and active substance(s), which are part of medicinal products or medical 
                   devices incorporating stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma.32. 
                   The VAMF is a stand-alone part of the marketing authorisation application dossier for 
                   a  vaccine.  One  given  VAMF  contains  all  relevant  information  of  biological, 
                   pharmaceutical and chemical nature for one given vaccine antigen, which is common 
                   to several vaccines from the same applicant or marketing authorisation holder. 
                   The PMF/VAMF certification procedure is aimed at simplifying the tasks of both 
                   applicants and competent authorities by: 
                          Reducing the number of dossier submissions and data evaluations carried out 
                           for the same plasma or vaccine antigen. 
                          Harmonising the data for a given plasma/antigen present in several medicinal 
                           products. 
                          Ensuring consistency throughout the European Union. 
                   The certification procedure consists of a centralised assessment of the PMF/VAMF 
                   application  dossier  submitted  by  the  applicant  or  marketing  authorisation  holder, 
                   which results in a certificate of compliance to Union legislation, issued by the EMA. 
                   This certificate is valid throughout the European Union. 
                   As a second step, the competent authority that will grant or has granted the marketing 
                   authorisation  for  the  concerned  medicinal  product(s)  (plasma-derived  medicinal 
                   products  for  PMFs,  vaccines  for  VAMFs)  takes  into  account  the  certification,  re-
                                                                                                      33
                   certification or variation of the PMF/VAMF on the concerned medicinal product(s).  
                                                                    
                   32 Referred to in Directive 2000/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 
                   2000 amending Council Directive 93/42/EC as regards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives 
                   of human blood or human plasma (OJ L 313, 13.12.2000, p. 22).

            ANNEX I DEFINITION OF A NEW ACTIVE SUBSTANCE 
            A new chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical active substance includes: 
            - a chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical substance not previously authorised in 
            a medicinal product for human use n the European Union; 
            -  an  isomer,  mixture  of  isomers,  a  complex  or  derivative  or  salt  of  a  chemical 
            substance previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the European 
            Union but differing significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy 
            from that chemical substance previously authorised; 
            - a biological substance previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in 
            the European Union, but differing significantly in properties with regard to safety 
            and/or efficacy which is due to differences in one or a combination of the following: 
            in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process; 
            - a radiopharmaceutical substance which is a radionuclide, or a ligand not previously 
            authorised  in  a  medicinal  product  for  human  use  in  the  European  Union,  or  the 
            coupling mechanism to link the molecule and the radionuclide has not been authorised 
            previously in the European Union.
