         4  SIGNALS INITIATED BY YOUR AIRCRAFT 
            AND RESPONSES 
         a)    ‘Aerodrome designated is inadequate for my aeroplane’ 
          Day - raise landing gear (if possible), while passing over landing runway at a 
            height exceeding 300 m (1,000 ft) but not exceeding 600 m (2,000 ft) above 
            the aerodrome level, and continue to circle the aerodrome. 
          Night - in addition, flash landing lights while passing over landing runway as 
            above. If unable to flash landing lights, flash any other available lights. 
         The intercepting aircraft responds to show he has understood. 
          – If it is desired that you follow him to an alternate aerodrome, he will raise his 
         landing gear and use the signals prescribed for intercepting aircraft in paragraph 
         3(a). However, if he has understood and decides you may proceed, he will use 
         the manoeuvre prescribed in paragraph 3(b). 
           
         b)  ‘I cannot comply’ 
         Day or Night - switch all available lights on and off at regular intervals but in such 
            a manner as to be distinct from flashing lights.
