           The international language of      
           ISO graphical symbols 
           Graphical symbols are vital for giving information when written words are not adequate. 
           International Standards developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) provide 
           people all over the world with a coherent set of graphical symbols to help overcome language and 
           other barriers.
                              ISO/TC 145, Graphical symbols, has deifned internationally accepted 
           A technical committee,
           requirements for designs, colours, content and shapes of graphical symbols.  
           These symbols convey important messages about product features, directions and other aspects 
           of daily life – whether at work, at home, or for leisure. Critical areas include health and safety-
           related warnings, prohibitions and mandatory actions.
           We invite you to see ifrst-hand how ISO graphical symbols help keep you safe and well-informed. 
           Join the Smith family as they discover just how useful ISO graphical symbols can be when 
           they leave on holiday for the ifctitious country of “Ambrosia”.

                 I think we have 
                 to gather over 
                   there.
                                         19

       Shapes and colours 
       of international safety signs
       The safety signs illustrated in this lealfet comply with design rules standardized and 
       published by ISO.
       The general public will encounter safety signs in a variety of situations, including in 
       workplaces, public areas and on products. The standardized colours and basic shapes for 
       safety signs are therefore important in helping to ensure that the different types of safety 
       signs, and the safety messages they convey, are easily recognizable. 
       Several safety signs are included in the story of the Smith family’s holiday.  
       In some cases, safety signs will be accompanied by additional signs or supplementary 
       text to help make the safety message clear. 
       Further examples of types of safety signs are shown on the following pages.
