                  8.      ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF A CLINICAL TRIAL 
                  8.1 Introduction 
                  Essential Documents are those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality 
                  of the data produced. These documents serve to demonstrate the compliance of the investigator, sponsor and monitor with the standards 
                  of Good Clinical Practice and with all applicable regulatory requirements. 
                  Essential Documents also serve a number of other important purposes. Filing essential documents at the investigator/institution and 
                  sponsor sites in a timely manner can greatly assist in the successful management of a trial by the investigator, sponsor and monitor. 
                  These documents are also the ones which are usually audited by the sponsor's independent audit function and inspected by the 
                  regulatory authority(ies) as part of the process to confirm the validity of the trial conduct and the integrity of data collected. 
                  The minimum list of essential documents which has been developed follows. The various documents are grouped in three sections 
                  according to the stage of the trial during which they  be generated: 1) before the clinical phase of the trial comwill normally                            mences, 2) 
                  during the clinical conduct of the trial, and 3) after completion or termination of the trial. A description is given of the purpose of each 
                  document, and whether it should be filed in either the investigator/institution or sponsor files, or both. It is acceptable to combine some of 
                  the documents, provided the individual elements are readily identifiable. 
                  Trial master files should be established at the beginning e trial, both at the investigator/institution’s site and at the of th                      sponsor's office. 
                  A final close-out of a trial can only be done when the monitor has reviewed both investigator/institution and sponsor files and confirmed 
                  that all necessary documents are in the appropriate files. 
                  Any or all of the documents addressed in this guideline may be subject to, and should be available for, audit by the sponsor’s auditor and 
                  inspection by the regulatory authority(ies). 
                                                                                                     41
