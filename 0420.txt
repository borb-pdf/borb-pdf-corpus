                     Safety & Health Policy 
             
      Alberta  Newsprint  Company  is  committed  to  its  employees, 
      contractors and visitors to provide and maintain a safe and healthy 
      work environment. 
             
      The Health and Safety Program has been developed to support the 
      commitment to safety and meet or exceed legislative requirements 
      and accepted industry standards. 
       
      Each person on site will implement the Health and Safety Program, 
      sharing the responsibility of safety, training and maintenance of a safe 
      work  environment  as  we  strive  for  excellence  in  the  newsprint 
      industry. 
       
                         INTRODUCTION 
       
      ALL  ACCIDENTS  CAN  BE  PREVENTED  AT  ALBERTA  NEWSPRINT 
      COMPANY 
       
      Working to this goal is expected of each Alberta Newsprint Company 
      employee and visitor.  Practice of safety procedures is a condition of 
      any presence on site.  Failure to comply could be used as a basis for 
      denying an individual admission to the mill or re-entrance to the mill 
      in the future.  We appreciate your cooperation and contribution in 
      making Alberta Newsprint Company a safe place to work. 
       
      Every person coming on site should view the safety orientation video 
      and receive a Visitor Safety and Orientation Booklet. 
       
      Each person visiting the mill must follow and comply with Alberta 
      Newsprint Company Safety Rules and Procedures. 
       
      At Alberta Newsprint Company, everyone is responsible for their own 
      safety and the safety of those around them.  Anyone observing an 
      unsafe work practice is to notify the individual immediately to aid in 
      the prevention of an accident.

           Sign-In/Sign-Out Procedure at Alberta Newsprint Company 
            
           All  employees of Alberta Newsprint Company are concerned about 
           your safety during your visit.  We also ask that you take an active role 
           in  promoting  your  own  safety  by  following  our  sign-in/sign-out 
           procedure at the front entrance area.  This fulfills a number of needs: 
            
              1.  It tells us who you are and the company your represent 
              2.  It indicates who you are visiting at the mill 
              3.  In the case of an evacuation emergency, it tells us that you are   
                  on site and need to be accounted for 
            
           The sign-out procedure is particularly critical, as it indicates that you 
           are no longer on site should an evacuation emergency occur.
