       Introduction
       The high number of fatal and serious accidents on farms is a signiifcant concern and it is 
       an issue that we need to address now. The pain, human suffering and economic loss that 
       accompanies these accidents is immense and I would like to extend my sympathy to all farm 
       families and communities that have been affected in this way. The sad thing is that almost 
       all accidents can be prevented by managing health and safety on the farm. Therefore it is 
       essential that farmers take a more proactive role in promoting farm safety and by putting 
       health and safety issues at the top of their agenda .
       While farmer’s attitudes to health and safety are generally          A combination of cultural based and behaviour based safety 
       very positive a change in safety culture and behaviour is            approaches works best. Cultural based serve to shape the 
       critical if we are to achieve a reduction in farm accidents.         perceptions held by individuals regarding the importance of

       change. Making a lasting change in behaviour is rarely               be “Champions for Safety” and to make a promise to farm

       commitment of time, effort and emotion. Many unsafe 
       practices on Irish farms are learned behaviours which have 
       been passed down for generations, but is it fair to pass these 
       on to the next generation? With this in mind it is imperative 
       that we target the farmers of the future as well as the 
       farmers of today. Behavioural change is rarely easy and 
       often requires a gradual progression of small steps toward 
       a larger goal. Changing behaviour is a slow process but it is 
       imperative if progress is to be made .

        The COP and DVD provide practical farm safety guidance 
        and the Risk Assessment Document is an easy to use risk 
        assessment tool that should be used when carrying out 
        a risk assessment on your farm. The Risk Assessment 
        Document has been developed to help farmers identify 
        hazards on their farm and in doing so to help prevent and 
        reduce the number of accidents and incidences of ill health 
        on the farm. This document can be completed either in 
        hard copy or on-line. Training on how to complete the

        parts and the poor mechanical condition of the tractor. The              maintenance and a good knowledge of the terrain.
        first step in trying to prevent accidents is to make sure that           FBD, the HSA and Teagasc have produced a “Safe Quad

          It is important that the tractor has a safety cab or safety 
          frame in case it turns over.
          Make sure that the cab is tidy so that nothing can get 
          caught under the pedals or in any of the levers.
          The brakes should be in good condition and a good 
          handbrake is essential.
          Removed guards should be put back in place. It is essential 
          that the PTO has a U-guard and that the PTO shaft is 
          covered.
          It is essential that all tractors on the road have a good 
          braking system, good tyres and adequate mirrors, lights, 
          wipers and indicating system .

       For instance, a cutting blade cannot be totally enclosed, 
       or it could not cut. In addition, up to 60% of farmers do not 
       put guards back in place after taking them off to carry out 
       maintenance work. The majority of machinery accidents 
       are the result of human error - the operator forgot 
       something, took a shortcut or a risk, ignored a warning, 
       was not paying close attention, failed to follow safety rules 
       or did not maintain the machine in a safe condition. There 
       are many different kinds of farm machinery — mowers, 
       tractors, harvesters, augers, slurry spreaders balers,

       Most farm accidents (fatal and non-fatal) involve livestock. 
       While many of these accidents are associated with handling 
       of bulls, countless other accidents involving other livestock 
       occur during routine tasks such as herding, handling, 
       loading, vaccinating and testing of livestock. Livestock that 
       are not handled regularly such as suckler herds and cows 
       with calf and at calving time are particularly dangerous as 
       they are often flighty, easily agitated and protective of their 
       young. A well designed cattle crush and livestock handling 
       facilities (e.g. calving pen, bull pen, etc.) is essential to ensure 
       safe and easy handling of livestock .

        It is important to note that most fatalities involving elderly 
        farmers have been caused by reversing machinery and 
        attacks by animals and this would suggest that lack of 
        mobility and flexibility plays a major part in elderly farmers 
        being unable to avoid these accidents. Because of this, 
        machine operators must always be aware of where elderly 
        farmers are standing and extra precautions must also be 
        taken to ensure the safety of elderly farmers when handling 
        livestock .
        Getting older does not mean you have to retire from                   The old saying “A little learning is a dangerous thing” is

       The chainsaw must be maintained in good condition and all 
       safety devices must be maintained in working order. When

        The Importance of Insurance
        Serious accidents always lead to heartache and pain, but 
        they can also cause financial ruin. This is why it is imperative 
        that you not only farm safely, but that you
        also ensure that you have adequate insurance in place to 
        protect yourself from financial hardship and give yourself 
        peace of mind.
        FBD strongly recommend that all farmers ensure that 
        they have adequate Personal Accident, Employers 
        Liability and Public Liability cover in place.
