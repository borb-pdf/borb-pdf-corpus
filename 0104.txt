            1 Each Party shall provide in its internal law a recovery and reflection period of at least 30 days, 
              when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person concerned is a victim. Such a 
              period shall be sufficient for the person concerned to recover and escape the influence of 
              traffickers and/or to take an informed decision on cooperating with the competent authorities. 
              During this period it shall not be possible to enforce any expulsion order against him or her. 
              This provision is without prejudice to the activities carried out by the competent authorities in 
              all  phases  of  the  relevant  national  proceedings,  and  in  particular  when  investigating  and

              Article 14 – Residence permit
            1 Each Party shall issue a renewable residence permit to victims, in one or other of the two

                 situation; 
              b  the competent authority considers that their stay is necessary for the purpose of their co-
                 operation with the competent authorities in investigation or criminal proceedings.
            2 The residence permit for child victims, when legally necessary, shall be issued in accordance 
              with  the  best  interests  of  the  child  and,  where  appropriate,  renewed  under  the  same 
              conditions.
            3 The non-renewal or withdrawal of a residence permit is subject to the conditions provided for 
              by the internal law of the Party.
            4 If a victim submits an application for another kind of residence permit, the Party concerned 
              shall take into account that he or she holds, or has held, a residence permit in conformity with 
              paragraph 1.
            5 Having regard to the obligations of Parties to which Article 40 of this Convention refers, each 
              Party  shall  ensure  that  granting  of  a  permit  according  to  this  provision  shall  be  without 
              prejudice to the right to seek and enjoy asylum.
              Article 15 – Compensation and legal redress
            1 Each  Party  shall  ensure  that  victims  have  access,  as  from  their  first  contact  with  the 
              competent authorities, to information on relevant judicial and administrative proceedings in a 
              language which they can understand.
            2 Each Party shall provide, in its internal law, for the right to legal assistance and to free legal 
              aid for victims under the conditions provided by its internal law.
            3 Each Party shall provide, in its internal law, for the right of victims to compensation from the

            4 Each Party shall adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to guarantee 
              compensation for victims in accordance with the conditions under its internal law, for instance 
              through the establishment of a fund for victim compensation or measures or programmes 
              aimed at social assistance and social integration of victims, which could be funded by the 
              assets resulting from the application of measures provided in Article 23.
              Article 16 – Repatriation and return of victims
            1 The Party of which a victim is a national or in which that person had the right of permanent 
              residence at the time of entry into the territory of the receiving Party shall, with due regard for 
              his or her rights, safety and dignity, facilitate and accept, his or her return without undue or 
              unreasonable delay. 
            2 When a Party returns a victim to another State, such return shall be with due regard for the 
              rights, safety and dignity of that person and for the status of any legal proceedings related to 
              the fact that the person is a victim, and shall preferably be voluntary. 
            3 At the request of a receiving Party, a requested Party shall verify whether a person is its 
              national or had the right of permanent residence in its territory at the time of entry into the 
              territory of the receiving Party.
            4 In order to facilitate the return of a victim who is without proper documentation, the Party of 
              which that person is a national or in which he or she had the right of permanent residence at 
              the time of entry into the territory of the receiving Party shall agree to issue, at the request of 
              the receiving Party, such travel documents or other authorisation as may be necessary to 
              enable the person to travel to and re-enter its territory. 
            5 Each Party shall adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to establish 
              repatriation  programmes,  involving  relevant  national  or  international  institutions  and  non 
              governmental organisations. These programmes aim at avoiding re-victimisation. Each Party 
              should make its best effort to favour the reintegration of victims into the society of the State of 
              return, including reintegration into the education system and the labour market, in particular 
              through the acquisition and improvement of their professional skills. With regard to children, 
              these  programmes  should  include  enjoyment  of  the  right  to  education  and  measures  to 
              secure adequate care or receipt by the family or appropriate care structures.
            6 Each Party shall adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to make 
              available  to  victims,  where  appropriate  in  co-operation  with  any  other  Party  concerned, 
              contact information of structures that can assist them in the country where they are returned 
              or  repatriated,  such  as  law  enforcement  offices,  non-governmental  organisations,  legal 
              professions able to provide counselling and social welfare agencies.
            7 Child victims shall not be returned to a State, if there is indication, following a risk and security 
              assessment, that such return would not be in the best interests of the child.
              Article 17 – Gender equality
              Each Party shall, in applying measures referred to in this chapter, aim to promote gender 
              equality and use gender mainstreaming in the development, implementation and assessment 
              of the measures.

              part of an organ of the legal person, who has a leading position within the legal person, based

            2 Apart from the cases already provided for in paragraph 1, each Party shall take the measures 
              necessary to ensure that a legal person can be held liable where the lack of supervision or

              criminal offence established in accordance with this Convention for the benefit of that legal 
              person by a natural person acting under its authority.

            1 Each Party  shall  adopt  such  measures  as  may  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  persons  or 
              entities  are  specialised  in  the  fight  against  trafficking  and  the  protection  of victims.  Such 
              persons  or  entities  shall  have  the  necessary  independence  in  accordance  with  the 
              fundamental principles of the legal system of the Party, in order for them to be able to carry

              such entities shall have adequate training and financial resources for their tasks.
            2 Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to ensure co-ordination of the 
              policies  and  actions of their governments’ departments and other public agencies against 
              trafficking in human beings, where appropriate, through setting up co-ordinating bodies.

              trafficking,  prosecuting  the  traffickers  and  protecting  the  rights  of the  victims,  including 
              protecting the victims from the traffickers.
            4 Each  Party  shall  consider  appointing  National  Rapporteurs  or  other  mechanisms for

              Freedoms, in particular Article 6, each Party shall adopt such legislative or other measures as 
              may be necessary to ensure in the course of judicial proceedings:
              a  the protection of victims’ private life and, where appropriate, identity;
              b  victims’ safety and protection from intimidation,

            2 Each Party may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, 
              acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of 
              the Council of Europe, declare that it reserves the right not to apply or to apply only in specific 
              cases or conditions the jurisdiction rules laid down in paragraphs 1 (d) and (e) of this article or 
              any part thereof.
            3 Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish jurisdiction over the 
              offences referred to in this Convention, in cases where an alleged offender is present in its 
              territory  and  it  does  not  extradite  him/her  to  another  Party,  solely  on  the  basis  of his/her 
              nationality, after a request for extradition.
            4 When  more  than  one  Party  claims  jurisdiction  over  an  alleged  offence  established  in 
              accordance with this Convention, the Parties involved shall, where appropriate, consult with a 
              view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecution.
            5 Without prejudice to the general norms of international law, this Convention does not exclude
              any criminal jurisdiction exercised by a Party in accordance with internal law.
          Chapter VI – International co-operation and co-operation with civil society
              Article 32 – General principles and measures for international co-operation
              The  Parties  shall  co-operate  with  each  other,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this 
              Convention,  and  through  application  of  relevant  applicable  international  and  regional 
              instruments,  arrangements  agreed  on  the  basis  of  uniform  or  reciprocal  legislation  and 
              internal laws, to the widest extent possible, for the purpose of:
              –  preventing and combating trafficking in human beings;
              –  protecting and providing assistance to victims;
              –  investigations  or  proceedings  concerning  criminal  offences  established  in  accordance 
                 with this Convention. 
              Article 33 – Measures relating to endangered or missing persons
            1 When a Party, on the basis of the information at its disposal has reasonable grounds to 
              believe that the life, the freedom or the physical integrity of a person referred to in Article 28, 
              paragraph 1, is in immediate danger on the territory of another Party, the Party that has the 
              information shall, in such a case of emergency, transmit it without delay to the latter so as to 
              take the appropriate protection measures.
            2 The Parties to this Convention may consider reinforcing their co-operation in the search for 
              missing people, in particular for missing children, if the information available leads them to 
              believe that she/he is a victim of trafficking in human beings. To this end, the Parties may 
              conclude bilateral or multilateral treaties with each other.
              Article 34 – Information
            1 The requested Party shall promptly inform the requesting Party of the final result of the action 
              taken under this chapter. The requested Party shall also promptly inform the requesting Party 
              of any circumstances which render impossible the carrying out of the action sought or are 
              likely to delay it significantly.

            2 A Party may, within the limits of its internal law, without prior request, forward to another Party 
              information obtained within the framework of its own investigations when it considers that the 
              disclosure of such information might assist the receiving Party in initiating or carrying out 
              investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences established in accordance with 
              this Convention or might lead to a request for co-operation by that Party under this chapter.
            3 Prior to providing such information, the providing Party may request that it be kept confidential 
              or used subject to conditions. If the receiving Party cannot comply with such request, it shall 
              notify  the  providing  Party,  which  shall  then  determine  whether  the  information  should 
              nevertheless  be  provided.  If  the  receiving  Party  accepts  the  information  subject  to  the 
              conditions, it shall be bound by them.
            4 All information requested concerning Articles 13, 14 and 16, necessary to provide the rights 
              conferred by these articles, shall be transmitted at the request of the Party concerned without 
              delay with due respect to Article 11 of the present Convention.
              Article 35 – Co-operation with civil society
              Each Party shall encourage  state authorities and  public officials,  to  co-operate  with  non-
              governmental organisations, other relevant organisations  and members of civil society, in 
              establishing strategic partnerships with the aim of achieving the purpose of this Convention.

              a  they  shall  be  chosen  from  among  persons  of  high  moral  character,  known  for  their 
                 recognised  competence  in  the  fields  of Human  Rights,  assistance  and  protection  of 
                 victims  and  of  action  against  trafficking  in  human  beings  or  having  professional 
                 experience in the areas covered by this Convention;
              b  they shall sit in their individual capacity and shall be independent and impartial in the

              Article 37 – Committee of the Parties
            1 The Committee of the Parties shall be composed of the representatives on the Committee of 
              Ministers  of  the  Council  of Europe  of  the  member States  Parties  to  the  Convention  and 
              representatives of the Parties to the Convention, which are not members of the Council of 
              Europe.
            2 The Committee of the Parties shall be convened by the Secretary General of the Council of 
              Europe. Its first meeting shall be held within a period of one year following the entry into force 
              of  this  Convention  in  order  to  elect  the  members  of  GRETA.  It  shall  subsequently  meet 
              whenever one-third of the Parties, the President of GRETA or the Secretary General so 
              requests.
            3 The Committee of the Parties shall adopt its own rules of procedure.
              Article 38 – Procedure
            1 The evaluation procedure shall concern the Parties to the Convention and be divided in 
              rounds, the length of which is determined by GRETA. At the beginning of each round GRETA 
              shall select the specific provisions on which the evaluation procedure shall be based.
            2 GRETA shall define the most appropriate means to carry out this evaluation. GRETA may in 
              particular adopt a questionnaire for each evaluation round, which may serve as a basis for the 
              evaluation  of the  implementation  by  the  Parties  of  the  present  Convention.  Such  a 
              questionnaire shall be addressed to all Parties. Parties shall respond to this questionnaire, as 
              well as to any other request of information from GRETA.
            3 GRETA may request information from civil society.
            4 GRETA may  subsidiarily  organise,  in co-operation  with  the  national  authorities  and  the 
              “contact person” appointed by the latter, and, if necessary, with the assistance of independent 
              national experts, country visits. During these visits, GRETA may be assisted by specialists in 
              specific fields.
            5 GRETA shall prepare a draft report containing its analysis concerning the implementation of
              the provisions on which the evaluation is based, as well as its suggestions and proposals 
              concerning the way in which the Party concerned may deal with the problems which have 
              been  identified.  The  draft  report  shall  be  transmitted  for  comments  to  the  Party  which 
              undergoes the evaluation. Its comments are taken into account by GRETA when establishing 
              its report.
            6 On this basis, GRETA shall adopt its report and conclusions concerning the measures taken 
              by the Party concerned to implement the provisions of the present Convention. This report 
              and conclusions shall be sent to the Party concerned and to the Committee of the Parties. 
              The report and conclusions of GRETA shall be made public as from their adoption, together 
              with eventual comments by the Party concerned.
            7 Without prejudice to the procedure of paragraphs 1 to 6 of this article, the Committee of the 
              Parties may adopt, on the basis of the report and conclusions of GRETA, recommendations 
              addressed  to  this  Party  (a)  concerning  the  measures  to  be  taken  to implement  the 
              conclusions  of  GRETA,  if  necessary  setting  a  date  for  submitting  information  on  their 
              implementation, and (b) aiming at promoting co-operation with that P>arty for the proper 
              implementation of the present Convention.

                         children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against transnational organised crime, 
                         and is intended to enhance the protection afforded by it and develop the standards contained

                    2    The Parties to the Convention may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements with one 
                         another  on  the  matters  dealt  with  in  this  Convention,  for  purposes  of  supplementing  or

                         rules governing the particular subject concerned and applicable to the specific case, without 
                         prejudice to the object and purpose of the present Convention and without prejudice to its full 
                                                       (1)

                         individuals under international law, including international humanitarian law and international 
                         human rights law and, in particular, where applicable, the 1951 Convention and the 1967 
                         Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and the principle of non-refoulement as contained 
                         therein.
                    _____
                    (1)  Note by the Secretariat:
                         See the Declaration formulated by the European Community and the Member States of the European 
                         Union upon the adoption of the Convention by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, on 
                         3 May 2005:
                         “The  European  Community/European  Union  and  its  Member  States  reaffirm  that  their  objective  in 
                         requesting the inclusion of a “disconnection clause” is to take account of the institutional structure of the 
                         Union when acceding to international conventions, in particular in case of transfer of sovereign powers 
                         from the Member States to the Community. 
                         This clause is not aimed at reducing the rights or increasing the obligations of a non-European Union 
                         Party vis-à-vis the European Community/European Union and its Member States, inasmuch as the latter 
                         are also parties to this Convention. 
                         The  disconnection  clause  is  necessary  for  those  parts  of  the  Convention  which  fall  within  the 
                         competence of the Community/Union, in order to indicate that European Union Member States cannot 
                         invoke and apply the rights and obligations deriving from the Convention directly among themselves (or 
                         between themselves and the European Community/Union). This does not detract from the fact that the 
                         Convention applies fully between the European Community/European Union and its Member States on 
                         the one hand, and the other Parties to the Convention, on the other; the Community and the European 
                         Union  Members  States  will  be  bound  by  the  Convention  and  will  apply  it  like  any  Party  to  the 
                         Convention, if necessary, through Community/Union legislation. They will thus guarantee the full respect 
                         of the Convention’s provisions vis-à-vis non-European Union Parties.”
