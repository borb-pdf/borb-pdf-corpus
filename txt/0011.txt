          Lean and Green is a fast expanding community of more than 300 companies, 
          municipalities and institutions. Their vision is that improving the sustainability
          of their transportation processes will improve their competitiveness. Setting a
          target of reducing their CO2 emissions by more than 20% in 5 years has proven
          to kickstart a cycle of continuous improvement, leading to increased customer
          value and reduced costs.

                   The success of Lean and Green in logistics attracted
                   members from other sectors, such as personal 
                   transportation (Personal Mobility) and tools to 
                   improve processes (Solutions). Special temporary
                   focus areas are chosen to accelerate the develop-
                   ment, such as Lean and Green Barge and Lean and
