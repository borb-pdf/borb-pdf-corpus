            4.1   Precautionary vs. Evidentiary Action
            Statistical-evidentiary approaches to risk analysis and
            mitigation count the frequency of past events (robust
            statistics), or calibrate parameters of statistical distribu-
            tions to generate probabilities of future events (para-
            metric approach), or both. Experimental evidentiary
            methods follow the model of medical trials, computing
            probabilities of harm from side effects of drugs or in-
            terventions by observing the reactions in a variety of
            animal and human models. Generally they assume that
            the risk itself (i.e. nature of harm and their probabil-
            ity) is adequately determined by available information.
            However, the level of risk may be hard to gauge as            Figure 3: Thin Tails from Tinkering, Bottom-Up, Evolu-
            its probability may be uncertain, and, in the case of         tion. In nature no individual variation represents a large
            potential inﬁnite harm, an uncertainty that allows for        share of the sum of the variations. Natural boundaries

            form, it is apparent that these approaches do not apply
            to ruin problems. In an evidentiary approach to risk
            (relying on evidence-based methods), the existence of
            a risk or harm occurs when we experience that risk or
            harm. In the case of ruin, by the time evidence comes it
            will by deﬁnition be too late to avoid it. Nothing in the
            past may predict one fatal event as illustrated in Fig. 4.
            Thus standard evidence-based approaches cannot work.
              More generally, evidentiary action is a framework
            based upon the quite reasonable expectation that we
            learn from experience. The idea of evidentiary action is
            embodied in the kind of learning from experience that is
            found in how people often react to disasters—after the
            fact. When a disaster occurs people prepare for the next      Figure 4: Fat Tails from a Top-Down, Engineered De-
