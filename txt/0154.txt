   If the problem doesn’t get resolved 
   If you don't take steps to solve the problem, and
   your local authority receives complaints about the
   noise your dog is making, the authority will
   investigate the complaint. The local authority may
   seek to resolve the problem by mediating between
   you and the complainants, but where it does not do
   so, or where such mediation is unsuccessful, and
   the authority is satisﬁed that the noise amounts to a
   statutory nuisance, it will serve you with an
   abatement notice requiring the noise to be reduced
   to an acceptable level.
   If you fail to comply with an abatement notice, you
   could face prosecution and, if convicted, a ﬁne of
   up to £5,000 (and possibly further daily ﬁnes of up
   to £500 for each day on which the offence
   continues after conviction).
