                    The science of AI is concerned with the study                   Indeed, the overarching question for the science of AI is:
                    of intelligent forms of behaviour in computational                   Howisitpossibleforsomethingphysical(likepeo-
                    terms. But what does it tell us when a good sem-                     ple, for instance) to actually do X?

                    tricks that seem to have little to do with what we              This needs to be contrasted with a related question:
                    intuitively imagine intelligence to be? Are these                    Can we engineer a computer system to do some-
                    intuitions wrong, and is intelligence really just a                  thing that is vaguely X-ish?
                    bag of tricks? Or are the philosophers right, and is            about which we will have much more to say later.
                    a behavioural understanding of intelligence simply                 Note that the science of AI studies intelligent behaviour,
                    too weak? I think both of these are wrong. I sug-               not who or what is producing the behaviour. It studies natu-
