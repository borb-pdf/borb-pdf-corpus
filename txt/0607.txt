Create Your Personal User Manual
In this document, you will find instructions on how to create your personal user manual.
Knowing what we need to be productive can help us do our best work and to design our
lifestyles around the things we love the most. The purpose of a personal user manual is to
help others understand us better so that we can collaborate more effectively.
Share anything that we are comfortable sharing with our colleagues and clients. It can
include as much or as little as we like. The most important question to ask is "What might
others need to know in order to collaborate effectively with us?"

Start with the basics

here
).

Pro tips
1.
There is no one right way for creating a personal user manual. Choose a tool that
you feel comfortable with AND that is easily accessible to your colleagues and
clients. For example: Google Docs or Slides, Confluence, Github, Notion.
2.
Think about what others need to know about working with you and start writing it
down or drawing it. When you are comfortable with what you have written/drawn,
share it! If you feel nervous putting it out in the world, try sharing it with some trusted
friends/colleagues first.
3.
Add a table of contents
. Help the reader to easily
locate specific information they’re
looking for.
4.
Add images, graphics, and emoticons. Pictures can describe things better than
words.
