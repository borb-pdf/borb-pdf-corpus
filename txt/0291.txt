                       General Principles 
                        of Conduct ;and Action
                        The  Saint-Gobain Group                                                                          has developed a number
                        of shared principles applied by both management
                        and employees that have guided the Group's
                        activities over the years.
                        Today the Group wishes to give written expression
                        to these principles, to help us communicate them
                        and reinforce their implementation throughout the
                        Group worldwide.
                        The purpose of  this documen t is also to make a
                        public sta temen t of Saint-Gobain ’s adherence  to
                        these basic                                 principles                            of conduc t and  action,which
                        apply  to all companies within the Group regardless
                        of where they carry on business.
                        These principles ar                                                  e not intended to be exhaustive,
                        but to address the essential areas.
                        They are complemented, and may in the future be
                        further complemented by sometimes more specific
                        rules having regard to local conditions or particular
                        positions of responsibility, but in any case without
                        detracting from the basic principles.
                        Adherence to these principles is a requirement for
                        belonging to the Saint-Gobain Group.
                                                                                                                                                             General Principles o  f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <          1
                                                                                                               Principles
               uof Conduct
                                    The Saint-Gobain Group considers 
                                    that the basic values shared 
                                    by managementand employees 
                                    alike are:
                                    professional commitment,
                                    respect for others,
                                    integrity, loyalty, and solidarity.
                                    These principles of conduct apply 
                                    to each of us.
                                                                                                                                                            General Principles o   f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <         2
                                      Principles 
                                      of conduct
          uProfessional commitment
                                    means mobilising to the best of one’s ability the knowledge
                                    and know-how of the individual and also calls for training to
                                    keep both up to date.It requires personal commitment and a
                                    willingness to take on the tasks assigned and to acquire
                                    knowledge necessary to do the job.It implies the effective
                                    contribution of each person in caring particularly for the
                                    environmentand for worker health and safety.
          uRespectfor others
                                    is an absolute prerequisite for the professional and personal
                                    developmentof each person.It applies throughout the Group
                                    worldwide.It implies an acceptance of pluralism and other
                                    cultures and of people of all origins. It is expressed in a 
                                    readiness to listen to others, to inform, to explain,and to
                                    engage in dialogue.
          uIntegrity
                                    requires a rigorous adherence to probity in all professional
                                    activities. It means that no individual may compromise the
                                    interests of the Group entrusted to that individual in favour
                                    of his or her own private interests – whether in dealing within
                                    the Group or in dea ling on beha lf of the Group with  third
                                    parties,whatever local practices might be.Detailed rules of
                                    conductmay be adopted for certain categories of Group 
                                    personnel where the nature of their responsibilities so requires.
                                                                                                                                                            General Principles o   f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <         3
                                      Principles 
                                      of conduct
          uLoyalty
                                    requires honesty and fairness in dealing with superiors,
                                    colleagues,subordinates and third parties dealing with the
                                    Group.In particular,it is incompatible with the pursuit of
                                    self-interest where the latter conflicts with the goals of the
                                    individual company or the Group as a whole.It implies the
                                    adherence to the guidelines and internal rules of individual
                                    companies and of the Group.
          uSolidarity
                                    is based on a sense of individual responsibility at work, which
                                    prevails over self-centered thinking.It encourages team work
                                    and bringing out                            the best in each person,                                     in order to achiev e
                                    the objec tives of the company and the Group.It means
                                    rejecting management or operational methods geared more
                                    to the self-satisfaction of given individuals rather than the
                                    interests of the individual company or the Group as a whole.
                                                                                                                                                            General Principles o  f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <          4
                                                                                                               Principles
               uof Action
                                    The Saint-Gobain Group wishes to set

                                    the activities of all management teams
                                    and employees in the exercise of their
                                    professional responsibilities, regardless 
                                    of the country involved.
                                    These principles of ac                                                                      tion(1) help us

                                    All Group companies must prohibit all actions which might
                                    breach applicable norms of competition law.They must

          uCaring for the environment
                                    Group companies are to actively promote the protection of
                                    the environment.
                                    All company sites,wherever they are located,must be man-
                                    aged in a w ay that allows the setting of clear environmental
                                    targets and  the regular monitoring of environmental per-
                                    formances and measuring the same against these targets.
                                    They muststrive to raise the main relevant environmental
                                    performance standards of their own sites to the level of 
                                    particularly ef                    fective performance standards found in the
                                    Group for comparable sites – even if that means going
                                    beyond the requirements of local legislation.
                                                                                                                                                           General Principles o   f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <          6

                                      of action
          uWorker health and safety
                                    Group companies are to take particular care to adopt all
                                    measures necessary to ensure the best possible protection
                                    against health and safety risks in the workplace.
                                    They must adopt risk reduction policies and follow-up on the
                                    due application of the same,checking actual results against
                                    the applicable standards.Such policies apply both to their
                                    own employees and to employees of sub-contractors,when
                                    the latter are working on a Group site.
                                    They must strive to raise the main relevant health and safety
                                    performance standards of their own sites to the levels of par-
