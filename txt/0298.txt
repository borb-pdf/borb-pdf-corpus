               1.  Ensure your company name is clearly stated on the Invoice. This will allow your Invoice to 
                    be paid correctly. 
               2.  Ensure your company address (including postcode) is shown on the Invoice. Missing 
                    details may result in delayed payment or returned Invoices. Your postcode is essential as 
                    this allows us to pay the correct site within our accounting system. Failure to provide your 
                    postcode could result in incorrect payments. Please ensure all relevant telephone, fax 
                    numbers and email addresses are also provided as this will allow us to contact you 
                    quickly if there is any reason why your invoice cannot be processed. 
               3.  Highlight  which  address,  department  and  contact  name  you  are  billing.  If  any  of  this 
                    information is missing from the invoice/ credit it will be returned as North Ayrshire Council 
                    will be unable to process it.  
               4.  Clearly identify if the item is an invoice or credit note. If this is not stated, your invoice / 
                    credit may be returned. 
               5.  Ensure  that  your  unique  invoice  /  credit  have  an  identifiable  invoice  /  credit  number 
                    stated. Invoices received without an invoice number will be returned. Our system is able 
                    to process invoice numbers up to 22 alphanumeric characters. 
               6.  Ensure the tax point / invoice date is clearly shown. This allows us to action your Invoice 
                    within the correct payment terms. 
               7.  Include any important comments on your invoice, which will speed up the processing 
                    time. For example credit notes require the related invoice number to be quoted to allow 
                    them to be matched to the original invoice. 
               8.  Quote  all  PO  numbers  provided.  Not  providing  the  correct  PO  number  will  delay  the 
                    payment of your Invoice and your invoice/credit may be returned. 
                    Please note that quoting an incorrect or expired PO will cause your invoice to be 
                    returned. If an organisation is ordering against a call off order please ensure you 
                    request a new PO if the previous order has expired. 
                    If there is no PO number provided please quote the name of the person requesting the 
                    goods in the PO Box. This should be in the format of XX first initial and last name, for 
                    example  XXJBLOGGS. Providing  this  information  will  allow  it  to  be  processed  more 
                    swiftly. 
               9.  Advising  the  contact  name  of  who  ordered  the  goods  will  allow  the  invoice  to  be 
                    processed more swiftly. 
               10. Delivery note numbers are very useful. When quoted they can help the organisations 
                    action their invoices quickly. 
               11. Ensure  a  clear  breakdown  of  invoice  value  is  provided.  Invoices  that  are  calculated 
                    incorrectly will be returned. Advise of any handling or freight charges. Ensure a clear VAT 
                    breakdown is provided to avoid delays. 
                    In addition please ensure your invoice / credit note: 
                  •     Is legible. Invoices will be scanned onto our system so need to be clear.  
                  •     Contains the relevant supporting information, such as timesheets.  
                  •     Is not printed on dark paper or in purple ink for scanning purposes.  
                  •     Is not handwritten. An example invoice template can be seen above.  
                  •     Is not stapled as this may create problems when it is scanned.   
                                                                                                                     
        1.   Company                        2. Company                 4. Identify
