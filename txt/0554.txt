       Health, safety and security is our number one priority. We have a dedicated 
       programme to uphold a positive and proactive safety culture. It’s called 
       ‘Protecting the Magic’.
       There are three key areas which are instrumental in ensuring the health, safety and 
       wellbeing of everyone who visits THORPE PARK Resort. These are: 
         Training & Instruction 
         Engineering Expertise & Ride Technology 
         Ride Maintenance 
       To do this we have six strategic initiatives, which can be found on the next page.

                        Training and instruction is at the heart of our approach to safety. 
                        Our ride operators and hosts complete extensive training and
                        assessments before they can work on our rides and attractions.

                             1.     Our ride operators go through hundreds of hours   
                                    of supervised training before they can operate our rides
                                    and take regular courses to refresh knowledge throughout  
                                    the year. 
                             2.     Managers at our attractions participate in safety leadership    
                                    courses to equip them with the right skills and knowledge to  
                                    help oversee safety standards correctly and effectively

                        THORPE PARK Resort has an extensive team of engineers who keep our 
                        rides and attractions running safely. They are highly trained in all mechanical 
                        and electrical ride systems. Each engineer undergoes ride-speciifc training 
                        and their individual performance is continually assessed through performance 
                        monitoring and auditing.

                                   throughout its ride’s lifecycle 
                             2.    All of our rollercoasters are controlled by sophisticated systems that                            
                                   monitor their safe operation at all times 
                             3.    The ride will stop should any of the multiple sensors be obstructed, even

                        AND INSPECTIONS
                        THORPE PARK Resort’s rides are kept running safely as a result of our 
                        rigorous approach to safety. Key to this are our highly trained engineers. 
                        Extensive maintenance and inspection arrangements are in place across all 
                        of our rides and attractions and these typically compromise of a full range of 
                        daily, weekly, monthly and annual engineering activities.

                            1.    It takes at least 8 man hours to get one of our big coasters ready f                                   or 
                                  opening every morning – that’s 40 hours to get our lfagship ifve coasters 
                                  ready every single day. That’s over 8,000 hours of inspection time
                            2.    In its 38 year history, THORPE PARK Resort has delivered over 65 million  
                                  rides and entertained over 46 million visitors 
                            3.    Every year, all of our rides must pass a thorough inspection by an independently

      SAFETY NEVER ENDS
      Safety will always remain a top priority for THORPE PARK Resort and we’re proud of the systems and procedures we 
      have in place across our business and of the huge team of people who care about keeping our guests safe. 
      We appreciate that we can never take safety for granted or become complacent in this area. That’s why we’re 
      continually working to identify and deliver new ideas for improving safety and reducing risk for our guests and people.
      Our engineers complete daily inspections for the safety-critical elements of each ride. These include inspecting 
      passenger restraint systems, brakes and emergency devices. Only once these inspections are completed is a ride 
      passed as safe for use by our ride operations teams. And if we are not content, we will not put the ride into operation 
      which is why all our rides are subject to availability on the day of our visit. We always advertise planned closures.
