                                 (d )  The quota of a member shall not be changed until the member 
                              has consented and until payment has been made unless payment is 
                              deemed to have been made in accordance with Section 3(b) of this

                              Fund, pay to the Fund twenty­ifve percent of the increase in special 
                              drawing rights, but the Board of Governors may prescribe that this pay­
                              ment may be made, on the same basis for all members, in whole or in 
                              part in the currencies of other members speciifed, with their concur­
                              rence, by the Fund, or in the member’s own currency. A non-participant 
                              shall pay in the currencies of other members speciifed by the Fund, with 
                              their concurrence, a proportion of the increase corresponding to the 
                              proportion to be paid in special drawing rights by participants. The bal                                         -
                              ance of the increase shall be paid by the member in its own currency. 
                              The Fund’s holdings of a member’s currency shall not be increased 
                              above the level at which they would be subject to charges under Article 
                              V, Section 8( b)(ii), as a result of payments by other members under this 
                              provision.
                                 (b)  Each member which consents to an increase in its quota under 
                              Section 2(b) of this Article shall be deemed to have paid to the Fund an 
                              amount of subscription equal to such increase.
                                 (c)   If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, 
                              within sixty days, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduc tion. 
                              The payment shall be made in the member’s currency and in such 
                              amount of special drawing rights or the currencies of other members 
                              speciifed, with their concurrence, by the Fund as is necessary to prevent 
                              the reduction of the Fund’s holdings of the currency below the new 
                              quota, provided that in exceptional circumstances the Fund may reduce 
                              its holdings of the currency below the new quota by payment to the 
                              member in its own currency.

            Section 4. Substitution of securities for currency
              The Fund shall accept from any member, in place of any part of the 
            member’s currency in the General Resources Account which in the 
            judgment of the Fund is not needed for its operations and transactions, 
            notes or similar obligations issued by the member or the depository 
            designated by the member under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be 
            non-negotiable, non-interest bearing and payable at their face value on 
            demand by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated deposi-
            tory. This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by mem-
            bers but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund 
            and to be placed in the General Resources Account.

            services, and capital among countries, and that sustains sound economic 
            growth, and that a principal objective is the continuing development of 
            the orderly underlying conditions that are necessary for ifnancial and 
            economic stability, each member undertakes to collaborate with the 
            Fund and other members to assure orderly exchange arrangements and 
            to promote a stable system of exchange rates. In particular, each mem-
            ber shall:
                  (i)  endeavor  to  direct  its  economic  and  ifnancial  policies 
                    toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth 
                    with reasonable price stability, with due regard to its 
                    circumstances;
                 (ii)  seek to promote stability by fostering orderly underlying 
                    economic and ifnancial conditions and a monetary system 
                    that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions;

                                                                  IV. Obligations Regarding Exchange Arrangements
                                                      (iii)  avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international 
                                                                  monetary system in order to prevent effective balance of 
                                                                  payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive 
                                                                  advantage over other members; and
                                                      (iv)  follow exchange policies compatible with the undertak  ings 
                                                                  under this Section.

                                           (a)  Each member shall notify the Fund, within thirty days after the 
                                       date of the second amendment of this Agreement, of the exchange 
                                       arrangements it intends to apply in fulifllment of its obligations under 
                                       Section 1 of this Article, and shall notify the Fund promptly of any 
                                       changes in its exchange arrangements.
                                           (b)  Under an international monetary system of the kind prevailing 
                                       on January 1, 1976, exchange arrangements may include (i) the main-
                                       tenance by a member of a value for its currency in terms of the special 
                                       drawing right or another denominator, other than gold, selected by the 
                                       member, or (ii) cooperative arrangements by which members maintain 
                                       the value of their currencies in relation to the value of the currency or 
                                       currencies of other members, or (iii) other exchange arrangements of 
                                       a member’s choice.
                                           (c) To accord with the development of the international monetary 
                                       system, the Fund, by an eighty­ifve percent majority of the total voting 
                                       power, may make provision for general exchange arrangements with                                                                              out 
                                       limiting the right of members to have exchange arrangements of their 
                                       choice consistent with the purposes of the Fund and the obligations

                                       Section 3. Surveillance over exchange arrangements
                                           (a) The Fund shall oversee the international monetary system in 
                                       order to ensure its effective operation, and shall oversee the compliance 
                                       of each member with its obligations under Section 1 of this Article.
                                           (b)  In order to fulifll its functions under (a) above, the Fund shall 
                                       exercise ifrm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of members, 
                                       and shall adopt speciifc principles for the guidance of all members with 
                                       respect to those policies. Each member shall provide the Fund with the 
                                       information necessary for such surveillance, and, when requested by 
                                       6
                                                                                          Art. IV, Sec. 4–5
                                     IV. Obligations Regarding Exchange Arrangements
                       the Fund, shall consult with it on the member’s exchange rate policies. 
                       The principles adopted by the Fund shall be consistent with coopera       tive 
                       arrangements by which members maintain the value of their cur  rencies 
                       in relation to the value of the currency or currencies of other members, 
                       as well as with other exchange arrangements of a member’s choice 
                       consistent with the purposes of the Fund and Section 1 of this Article. 
                       These principles shall respect the domestic social and political policies 
                       of members, and in applying these principles the Fund shall pay due 
                       regard to the circumstances of members.
                       Section 4. Par values
                         The Fund may determine, by an eighty­ifve percent majority of the 
                       total voting power, that international economic conditions permit the 
                       introduction of a widespread system of exchange arrangements based 
                       on stable but adjustable par values. The Fund shall make the determina-
                       tion on the basis of the underlying stability of the world economy, and 
                       for this purpose shall take into account price movements and rates of 
                       expansion in the economies of members. The determination shall be 
            th         made in light of the evolution of the international monetary system, wi
                       particular reference to sources of liquidity, and, in order to ensure the 
                       effective operation of a system of par values, to arrangements under 
                       which both members in surplus and members in deifcit in their balances 
                       of payments take prompt, effective, and symmetrical action to achieve 
                       adjustment, as well as to arrangements for intervention and the treat-
                       ment of imbalances. Upon making such determination, the Fund shall 
                       notify members that the provisions of Schedule C apply.

                       respect of which the member has accepted this Agreement under -                       Arti
                       cle XXXI, Section 2(g) unless the member declares that its action 
                       relates either to the metropolitan currency alone, or only to one or more 
                       speciifed separate currencies, or to the metropolitan currency and one 
                       or more speciifed separate currencies.
                         (b)  Action by the Fund under this Article shall be deemed to relate to 
                       all currencies of a member referred to in (a) above unless the Fund 
                       declares otherwise.
                                                                                                    7

             assist members to solve their balance of payments problems in a manner 
             consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that will establish

                                   (ii)  the member represents that it has a need to make the 
                                         pur chase because of its balance of payments or its reserve 
                                         position or developments in its reserves;
                                  (iii)  the proposed purchase would be a reserve tranche pur-
                                         chase, or would not cause the Fund’s holdings of the 
                                         purchasing member’s currency to exceed two hundred 
                                         percent of its quota;
                                  (iv)  the Fund has not previously declared under Section 5 of 
                                         this Article, Article VI, Section 1, or Article XXVI, Sec-

                         whether the proposed purchase would be consistent with the provisions 
                         of this Agreement and the policies adopted under them, provided that 
                         requests for reserve tranche purchases shall not be subject to challenge.

                         currencies to be sold that take into account, in consultation with mem-
                         bers, the balance of payments and reserve position of members and 
                         developments in the exchange markets, as well as the desirability of

                         equivalent amount of its own currency offered by the other member, it 
                         shall be entitled to purchase the currency of the other member unless

                         of the currency have become scarce.

                                         currency or can be exchanged at the time of purchase for 
                                         a freely usable currency of its choice at an exchange rate 
                                         between the two currencies equivalent to the exchange rate 
                                         between them on the basis of Article XIX, Section 7(              a).

                              would be subject to charges under Section 8(                     b)(ii) of this Article with        out

                              another member such part of the currency received as would prevent such
                              an increase. The exchange of a currency for the currency of another mem                                 -

                              Article. The Fund shall adopt policies and procedures with regard to 
                              exchanges that take into account the principles applied under Section 7(                               i)

                              be at a price agreed for each operation or transaction on the basis of 
                              prices in the market.
                                  (e) The Fund may sell gold held by it on the date of the second 
                              amendment of this Agreement to those members that were members on 
                              August 31, 1975 and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their quotas 
                              on that date. If the Fund intends to sell gold under (c) above for the 
                              purpose of ( f   )(ii) below, it may sell to each developing member that 
                              agrees to buy it that portion of the gold which, if sold under (c) above, 
                              would have produced the excess that could have been distributed to it 
                              under (  f  )(iii) below. The gold that would be sold under this provision to 
                              a member that has been declared ineligible to use the general resources 
                              of the Fund under Section 5 of this Article shall be sold to it when the 
                              ineligibility ceases, unless the Fund decides to make the sale sooner.

                      Section 1. Measures to replenish the Fund’s holdings of currencies
                        The Fund may, if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its 
                      holdings of any member’s currency in the General Resources Account 
                      needed in connection with its transactions, take either or both of the 
                      following steps:
                               (i)  propose to the member that, on terms and conditions 
                                    agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend 
                                    its currency to the Fund or that, with the concurrence of 
                                    the member, the Fund borrow such currency from some 
                                    other source either within or outside the territories of the 
                                    member, but no member shall be under any obligation to 
                                    make such loans to the Fund or to concur in the borrow-
                                    ing of its currency by the Fund from any other source;
                               (ii)  require the member, if it is a participant, -                                  to sell its cur
                                    rency to the Fund for special drawing rights held in the 
                                    General Resources Account, subject to Article XIX, Sec-
                                    tion 4. In replenishing with special drawing rights, the 
                                    Fund shall pay due regard to the principles of designation 
                                    under Article XIX, Section 5.
                      Section 2. General scarcity of currency
                        If the Fund ifnds that a general scarcity of a particular currency is 
                      developing, the Fund may so inform members and may issue a report 
                      setting forth the causes of the scarcity and containing recommendations 
                      designed to bring it to an end. A representative of the member whose 
                      currency is involved shall participate in the preparation of the report.
                      Section 3. Scarcity of the Fund’s holdings
                        (a)  If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a mem-
                      ber’s currency seriously threatens the Fund’s ability to supply that cur   -
                      rency, the Fund, whether or not it has issued a report under Section 2 of 
                      this Article, shall formally declare such currency scarce and shall 
                                                                                                21

                                 thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing supply of the scarce cur                                                    -
                                 rency with due regard to the relative needs of members, the general 
                                 international economic situation, and any other pertinent considera-
                                 tions. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.
                                     (b)  A formal declaration under (a) above shall operate as an authori-
                                 zation to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to 
                                 impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce 
                                 currency. Subject to the provisions of Article IV and Schedule C, the 
                                 member shall have complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of 
                                 such limitations, but they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary 
                                 to limit the demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or 
                                 accruing to, the member in question, and they shall be relaxed and 
                                 removed as rapidly as conditions permit.
                                     (c)  The authorization under (                     b) above shall expire whenever the Fund 
                                 formally declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce.
                                 Section 4. Administration of restrictions
                                     Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency of any 
                                 other member pursuant to the provisions of Section 3(b) of this Article 
                                 shall give sympathetic consideration to any representations by the other 
                                 member regarding the administration of such restrictions.
                                 Section 5. Effect of other international agreements on restrictions
                                     Members agree not to invoke the obligations of any engagements 
                                 entered into with other members prior to this Agreement in such man  ner 
                                 as will prevent the operation of the provisions of this Article.

                                     In addition to the obligations assumed under other articles of this 
                                 Agreement, each member undertakes the obligations set out in this 
                                 Article.

                      and which are contrary to the exchange control regulations of that mem      -
                      ber maintained or imposed consistently with this Agreement shall be 
                      unenforceable in the territories of any member. In addition, mem bers 
                      may, by mutual accord, cooperate in measures for the purpose of mak-
                      ing the exchange control regulations of either member more eftive, fec

                      outside margins under Article IV or prescribed by or under Schedule C, 
                      except as authorized under this Agreement or approved by the Fund. If 
                      such arrangements and practices are engaged in at the date when this 
                      Agreement enters into force, the member concerned shall consult with

                      Section 3 of that Article shall apply.

                                    current transactions.
                                                                                                23

                regulations of the member which is asked to buy them;
              (iv)  the currency of the member requesting the purchase has

                     whereby the Executive Board, when it deems such action to be in the 
                     best interests of the Fund, may obtain a vote of the Governors on a 
                     speciifc question without calling a meeting of the Board of Governors.

                         be required for election. While the ofifce remains vacant, the Alternate 
                         of the former Executive Director shall exercise his powers, except that 
                         of appointing an Alternate.

                                           applicable, the votes which an Executive Director would 
                                           otherwise be entitled to cast shall be increased or decreased 
                                           correspondingly. All the votes which an Executive Direc-
                                           tor is entitled to cast shall be cast as a unit.

                                           terminated under Article XXVI, Section 2(b), the mem ber 
                                           may agree with all the members that have elected an 
                                           Executive Director that the number of votes allotted to 
                                           that member shall be cast by such Executive Director, 
                                           provided that, if no regular election of Executive Direc                   tors 
                                           has been conducted during the period of the suspen sion,

                                           elected in accordance with paragraph 3(c)(i) of Schedule

                    Section 1. Notiifcation to the Fund
                      Each member shall notify the Fund whether it intends to avail itself 
                    of the transitional arrangements in Section 2 of this Article, or whether 
                    it is prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 
                    4. A member availing itself of the transitional arrangements shall notify 
                    the Fund as soon thereafter as it is prepared to accept these obligations.
                    Section 2. Exchange restrictions
                      A member that has notiifed the Fund that it intends to avail itself of 
                    transitional arrangements under this provision may, notwithstanding the 
                    provisions of any other articles of this Agreement, maintain and adapt 
                    to changing circumstances the restrictions on payments and transfers 
                    for current international transactions that were in effect on the date on 
                    which it became a member. Members shall, however, have continuous 
                    regard in their foreign exchange policies to the purposes of the Fund, 
                    and, as soon as conditions permit, they shall take all possible measures 
                    to develop such commercial and ifnancial arrangements with other 
                    members as will facilitate international payments and the promotion of 
                    a stable system of exchange rates. In particular, members shall withdraw 
                    restrictions maintained under this Section as soon as they are satisifed 
                    that they will be able, in the absence of such restrictions, to settle their 
                    balance of payments in a manner which will not unduly encumber their 
                    access to the general resources of the Fund.
                    Section 3. Action of the Fund relating to restrictions
                      The Fund shall make annual reports on the restrictions in force under 
                    Section 2 of this Article. Any member retaining any restrictions incon-
                    sistent with Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, or 4 shall consult the Fund 
                    annually as to their further retention. The Fund may, if it deems such 
                    action necessary in exceptional circumstances, make representations 
                    to any member that conditions are favorable for the withdrawal of any 
                    particular restriction, or for the general abandonment of restrictions, 
                    inconsistent with the provisions of any other articles of this Agree    ment. 
                    The member shall be given a suitable time to reply to such rep-
                    resentations. If the Fund ifnds that the member persists in maintaining

                             Allocation and Cancellation of Special Drawing Rights
                       Section 1. Pr    inciples and considerations governing allocation and 
                                    cancellation
                          (a)  In all its decisions with respect to the allocation and cancellation 
                       of special drawing rights the Fund shall seek to meet the long-term 
                       global need, as and when it arises, to supplement existing reserve assets 
                       in such manner as will promote the attainment of its purposes and will 
                       avoid economic stagnation and delfation as well as excess demand and 
                       inlfation in the world.
                          (b)  The ifrst decision to allocate special drawing rights shall take into 
                       account, as special considerations, a collective judgment that there is a 
                       global need to supplement reserves, and the attainment of a better bal-
                       ance of payments equilibrium, as well as the likelihood of a better work               -
                       ing of the adjustment process in the future.
                       Section 2. Allocation and cancellation
                          (a)  Decisions of the Fund to allocate or cancel special drawing rights 
                       shall be made for basic periods which shall run consecutively and shall 
                       be ifve years in duration. The ifrst basic period shall begin on the date 
                       of the ifrst decision to allocate special drawing rights or such later date 
                       as may be speciifed in that decision. Any allocations or cancellations 
                       shall take place at yearly intervals.
                          (b)  The rates at which allocations are to be made shall be expressed 
                       as percentages of quotas on the date of each decision to allocate. The 
                       rates at which special drawing rights are to be cancelled shall be 
                       expressed as percentages of net cumulative allocations of special draw-
                       ing rights on the date of each decision to cancel. The percentages shall 
                       be the same for all participants.
                          (c)  In its decision for any basic period the Fund may provide, not-
                       withstanding (a) and (b) above, that:
                                  (i)  the duration of the basic period shall be other than ifve 
                                       years; or
                                 (ii)  the allocations or cancellations shall take place at other 
                                       than yearly intervals; or
                       42
                                                                                                           Art. XVIII, Sec. 3
                                       XVIII. Allocation and Cancellation of Special Drawing Rights
                                     (iii)  the basis for allocations or cancellations shall be the quo-
                                             tas or net cumulative allocations on dates other than the 
                                             dates of decisions to allocate or cancel.
                              (d) A member that becomes a participant after a basic period starts 
                           shall receive allocations beginning with the next basic period in which 
                           allocations are made after it becomes a participant unless the Fund 
                           decides that the new participant shall start to receive allocations begin-
                           ning with the next allocation after it becomes a participant. If the Fund 
                           decides that a member that becomes a participant during a basic period 
                           shall receive allocations during the remainder of that basic period and 
                           the participant was not a member on the dates established under (b) or 
                           (c) above, the Fund shall determine the basis on which these allocations 
                           to the participant shall be made.
                              (e) A participant shall receive allocations of special drawing rights 
                           made pursuant to any decision to allocate unless:
                                       (i)  the Governor for the participant did not vote in favor of 
                                             the decision; and
                                      (ii)  the participant has notiifed the Fund in writing prior to 
                                             the ifrst  allocation  of  special  drawing rights under that 
                                             decision that it does not wish special drawing rights to 
                                             be allocated to it under the decision. On the request of a 
                                             par ticipant, the Fund may decide to terminate the effect 
                                             of the notice with respect to allocations of special drawing 
                                             rights subsequent to the termination.
                              (   f   )  If on the effective date of any cancellation the amount of special 
                           drawing rights held by a participant is less than its share of the special 
                           drawing rights that are to be cancelled, the participant shall eliminate its 
                           negative balance as promptly as its gross reserve position permits and 
                           shall remain in consultation with the Fund for this purpose. Special draw-
                           ing rights acquired by the participant after the effective date of the can                    -
                           cellation shall be applied against its negative balance and cancelled.
                           Section 3. Unexpected major developments
                              The Fund may change the rates or intervals of allocation or cancel-
                           lation during the rest of a basic period or change the length of a basic 
                           period or start a new basic period, if at any time the Fund ifnds it desir­
                           able to do so because of unexpected major developments.
                                                                                                                       43

              (a) Decisions under Section 2(a), (b), and (c) or Section 3 of this 
            Article shall be made by the Board of Governors on the basis of pro­
            posals of the Managing Director concurred in by the Executive Board.
              (b)  Before making any proposal, the Managing Director, after hav-
            ing satisifed himself that it will be consistent with the provisions of 
            Section 1(a) of this Article, shall conduct such consultations as will 
            enable him to ascertain that there is broad support among participants 
            for the proposal. In addition, before making a proposal for the ifrst 
            allocation, the Managing Director shall satisfy himself that the provi-
            sions of Section 1(b) of this Article have been met and that there is 
            broad support among participants to begin allocations; he shall make 
            a proposal for the ifrst allocation as soon after the establishment of the 
            Special Drawing Rights Department as he is so satisifed.
              (c)  The Managing Director shall make proposals:
                  (i)  not later than six months before the end of each basic 
                    period;
                 (ii)  if no decision has been taken with respect to allocation 
                    or cancellation for a basic period, whenever he is satisifed 
                    that the provisions of (b) above have been met;
                 (iii)  when, in accordance with Section 3 of this Article, he 
                    con siders that it would be desirable to change the rate or 
                    inter vals of allocation or cancellation or change the length 
                    of a basic period or start a new basic period; or
                 (iv)  within six months of a request by the Board of Governors 
                    or the Executive Board;
            provided that, if under (i), (iii), or (iv) above the Managing Director 
            ascertains that there is no proposal which he considers to be consistent 
            with the provisions of Section 1 of this Article that has broad support 
            among participants in accordance with (b) above, he shall report to the 
            Board of Governors and to the Executive Board.
              (d )  An eighty­ifve percent majority of the total voting power shall be 
            required for decisions under Section 2(a), (b), and (c) or Section 3 of 
            this Article except for decisions under Section 3 with respect to a 
            decrease in the rates of allocation.

                       tions authorized by or under this Agreement.
                       Section 2. Operations and transactions between participants
                          (a)  A participant shall be entitled to use its special drawing rights to 
                       obtain an equivalent amount of currency from a participant designated 
                       under Section 5 of this Article.
                          (b)  A participant, in agreement with another participant, may use its 
                       special drawing rights to obtain an equivalent amount of currency from 
                       the other participant.
                         ,( c)  The Fund, by a seventy percent majority of the total voting power
                       may prescribe operations in which a participant is authorized to engage 
                       in agreement with another participant on such terms and conditions as  
                       the Fund deems appropriate. The terms and conditions shall be consis-
                       tent with the effective functioning of the Special Drawing Rights

                       according to the principles of Section 5 of this Article or is otherwise 
                       inconsistent with Article XXII. A participant that persists in entering 
                       into such operations or transactions shall be subject to Article XXIII, 
                       Section 2(b).

                       payments or its reserve position or developments in its reserves, and not 
                       for the sole purpose of changing the composition of its reserves.

            and entitled to obtain them with a freely usable currency from a partici-
            pant which the Fund shall specify. Special drawing rights acquired by a 
            participant after the date for payment shall be applied against its unpaid 
            charges and cancelled.

              Currency received by the Fund from a terminating participant shall 
            be used by the Fund to redeem special drawing rights held by partici-
            pants in proportion to the amount by which each participant’s holdings 
            of special drawing rights exceed its net cumulative allocation at the time

            terminating participant or a freely usable currency to the Fund and shall

            own currency, a freely usable currency, or any other asset from any 
            holder, if the Fund so permits.

                    in Section 2(b) of this Article, when they are to be 
                    redeemed, in a transaction with the Fund conducted 
                    through the General Resources Account to obtain its own 
                    currency or a freely usable currency at the option of the

                    for a currency acceptable to the Fund to meet any charges 
                    or installment due under an agreement or the provisions 
                    of Schedule H.

                       ments levied before that date but not paid shall be paid in special draw-

                       rights held by holders, and each participant shall be obligated to pay the 
                       Fund an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation of special draw-
                       ing rights and such other amounts as may be due and payable because 
                       of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department.

                                                    XXIX. Interpretation
                                                    Article XXiX 
                                                    Interpretation
                         (a) Any question of interpretation of the provisions of this Agree-
                      ment arising between any member and the Fund or between any mem-
                      bers of the Fund shall be submitted to the Executive Board for its 
                      decision. If the question particularly affects any member, it shall be 
                      entitled to representation in accordance with Article XII, Section 3(  j).
                         (b )  In any case where the Executive Board has given a decision under
                      (a) above, any member may require, within three months from the date 
                      of the decision, that the question be referred to the Board of Governors, 
                      whose decision shall be ifnal. Any question referred to the Board of 
                      Governors shall be considered by a Committee on Interpretation         of the 
                      Board of Governors. Each Committee member shall have one vote. The 
                      Board of Governors shall establish the membership, procedures, and 
                      voting majorities of the Committee. A decision of the Committee shall 
                      be the decision of the Board of Governors unless the Board of Gover-
                      nors, by an eighty­ifve percent majority of the total vot ing power, 
                      decides otherwise. Pending the result of the reference to the Board of 
                      Governors the Fund may, so far as it deems necessary, act on the basis 
                      of the decision of the Executive Board.
                         (c)  Whenever a disagreement arises between the Fund and a member 
                      which has withdrawn, or between the Fund and any member during 
                      liquidation of the Fund, such disagreement shall be submitted to arbitra     -
                      tion by a tribunal of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Fund, another 
                      by the member or withdrawing member, and an umpire who, unless the 
                      parties otherwise agree, shall be appointed by the President of the Inter    -
                      national Court of Justice or such other authority as may have been pre       -
                      scribed by regulation adopted by the Fund. The umpire shall have full 
                      power to settle all questions of procedure in any case where the parties 
                      are in disagreement with respect thereto.

                   provided that for the purposes of this deifnition the Fund may exclude

                    chases under 4 above, and any speciifcation of currencies under 2 above 
                    shall be in accordance with Article V, Section 7(i).
                       6.  All rules and regulations, rates, procedures, and decisions in effect 
                    at the date of the second amendment of this Agreement shall remain in 
                    effect until they are changed in accordance with the provisions        of this 
                    Agreement.
                       7.  To the extent that arrangements equivalent in effect to (a) and (b) 
                    below have not been completed before the date of the second amend-
                    ment of this Agreement, the Fund shall
                         (a)  sell up to 25 million ounces of ifne gold held by it on 
                                  August 31, 1975, to those members that were members on 
                                  that date and that agree to buy it, in proportion to their 
                                  quotas  on  that  date.  The  sale  to  a  member  under  this 
                                  subparagraph (a) shall be made in exchange for its cur-
                                  rency and at a price equivalent at the time of sale to one 
                                  special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of ifne gold, and
                         (b)  sell up to 25 million ounces of ifne gold held by it on 
                                  August 31, 1975, for the beneift of developing members 
                                  that were members on that date, provided, however, that 
                                  the part of any proifts or surplus value of the gold that 
                                  corresponds to the proportion of such a member’s quota 
                                  on August 31, 1975, to the total of the quotas of all mem-
                                  bers on that date shall be transferred directly to each such 
                                  member. The requirements under Article V, Section 12(c) 
                                  that the Fund consult a member, obtain a member’s con-
                                  currence, or exchange a member’s currency for the curren­
                                  cies of other members in certain circumstances shall apply 
                                  with respect to currency received by the Fund as a result 
                                  of sales of gold under this provision, other than sales to 
                                  a member in return for its own currency, and placed in 
                                  the General Resources Account.
                    Upon the sale of gold under this paragraph 7, an amount of the pro-
                    ceeds in the currencies received equivalent at the time of sale to one 
                    special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram of ifne gold shall be placed in 
                    the General Resources Account and other assets held by the Fund under 
                    arrangements pursuant to (b) above shall be held separately from the

                            Schedule c 
                            Par Values
             1. The Fund shall notify members that par values may be estab-
            lished for the purposes of this Agreement, in accordance with Article 
            IV, Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 and this Schedule, in terms of the special 
            drawing right, or in terms of such other common denominator as is 
            prescribed by the Fund. The common denominator shall not be gold or 
            a currency.
             2.  A member that intends to establish a par value for its currency shall
            propose a par value to the Fund within a reasonable time after notice is 
            given under 1 above.
             3. Any member that does not intend to establish a par value for its 
            currency under 1 above shall consult with the Fund and ensure that its 
            exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund and 
            are adequate to fulifll its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.
             4.  The Fund shall concur in or object to a proposed par value within 
            a reasonable period after receipt of the proposal. A proposed par value 
            shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agreement if the Fund 
            objects to it, and the member shall be subject to 3 above. The Fund shall 
            not object because of the domestic social or political policies of the 
            member proposing the par value.
             5.  Each member that has a par value for its currency undertakes to 
            apply appropriate measures consistent with this Agreement in order to 
            ensure that the maximum and the minimum rates for spot exchange 
            transactions taking place within its territories between its currency and 
            the currencies of other members maintaining par values shall not differ 
            from parity by more than four and one-half percent or by such other 
            margin or margins as the Fund may adopt by an eighty­ifve perc ent 
            majority of the total voting power.

                                                     C. Par Values
                       6. A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its cur-
                    rency except to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental 
                    disequilibrium. A change may be made only on the proposal of the 
                    member and only after consultation with the Fund.
                       7.  When a change is proposed, the Fund shall concur in or object to 
                    the proposed par value within a reasonable period after receipt of the 
                    proposal. The Fund shall concur if it is satisifed that the change is 
                    necessary to correct, or prevent the emergence of, a fundamental dis-
                    equilibrium. The Fund shall not object because of the domestic social 
                    or political policies of the member proposing the change. A proposed 
                    change in par value shall not take effect for the purposes of this Agree     -
                    ment if the Fund objects to it. If a member changes the par value of its 
                    currency despite the objection of the Fund, the member shall be subject 
                    to Article XXVI, Section 2. Maintenance of an unrealistic par value by 
                    a member shall be discouraged by the Fund.
                       8. The par value of a member’s currency established under this 
                    Agreement shall cease to exist for the purposes of this Agreement if 
                    the member informs the Fund that it intends to terminate the par value. 
                    The Fund may object to the termination of a par value by a decision 
                    taken by an eighty­ifve percent majority of the total voting power. If 
                    a member terminates a par value for its currency despite the objection 
                    of the Fund, the member shall be subject to Article XXVI, Section 2. 
                    A par value established under this Agreement shall cease to exist for 
                    the purposes of this Agreement if the member terminates the par value 
                    despite the objection of the Fund, or if the Fund ifnds that the member 
                    does not maintain rates for a substantial volume of exchange transac-
                    tions in accordance with 5 above, provided that the Fund may not 
                    make such ifnding unless it has consulted the member and given it 
                    sixty days notice of the Fund’s intention to consider whether to make 
                    a ifnding.
                       9.  If the par value of the currency of a member has ceased to exist 
                    under 8 above, the member shall consult with the Fund and ensure that 
                    its exchange arrangements are consistent with the purposes of the Fund 
                    and are adequate to fulifll its obligations under Article IV, Section 1.
                       10. A member for whose currency the par value has ceased to exist 
                    under 8 above may, at any time, propose a new par value for its 
                    currency.

                       11.  Notwithstanding 6 above, the Fund, by a seventy percent major   -
                     ity of the total voting power, may make uniform proportionate changes 
                     in all par values if the special drawing right is the common denominator 
                     and the changes will not affect the value of the special drawing right. 
                     The par value of a member’s currency shall, however, not be changed 
                     under this provision if, within seven days after the Fund’s action, the 
                     member informs the Fund that it does not wish the par value of its cur -
                     rency to be changed by such action.

                       1. (a)  Each member or group of members that has the number 
                                  of votes allotted to it or them cast by an Executive 
                                  Director shall appoint to the Council one Councillor, 
                                  who shall be a Governor, Minister in the government of 
                                  a member, or person of comparable rank, and may 
                                  appoint not more than seven Associates. The Board of 
                                  Governors may change, by an eighty­ifve percent major-
                                  ity of the total voting power, the number of Associates 
                                  who may be appointed. A Councillor or Associate shall 
                                  serve until a new appointment is made or until the next 
                                  regular election of Executive Directors, whichever shall 
                                  occur sooner.
                         (b)  Executive Directors, or in their absence their Alternates, 
                                  and Associates shall be entitled to attend meetings of the 
                                  Council, unless the Council decides to hold a restricted 
                                  session. Each member and each group of members that 
                                  appoints a Councillor shall appoint an Alternate who shall 
                                  be entitled to attend a meeting of the Council when the 
                                  Councillor is not present, and shall have full power to act 
                                  for the Councillor.
                       2. (a)  The Council shall supervise the management and adapta-

                                  developing countries.

                     votes allotted under Article XII, Section 5 to the member 
                     or group of members appointing him. A Councillor 
                     appointed by a group of members may cast separately the 
                     votes allotted to each member in the group. If the number 
                     of votes allotted to a member cannot be cast by an Execu-
                     tive Director, the member may make arrangements with 
                     a Councillor for casting the number of votes allotted to 
                     the member.
               (c)  The Council shall not take any action pursuant to powers 
                     delegated by the Board of Governors that is inconsistent 
                     with any action taken by the Board of Governors and the

                                    the average of its total daily holdings of special drawing 
                                    rights over the most recent ifve­year period will be not 
                                    less than thirty percent of the average of its daily net 
                                    cumulative allocation of special drawing rights over the 
                                    same period.

                                    for each participant so as to ascertain whether and to what 
                                    extent the participant would need to acquire special draw      -
                                    ing rights between the date of the calculation and the end 
                                    of any ifve­year period in order to comply with the require-

                                    the calculations under (a)(ii) above indicate that it is 
                                    unlikely that the participant will be able to comply with 
                                    the requirement in (a)(i) above unless it ceases to use 
                                    special drawing rights for the rest of the period for which 
                                    the calculation was made under a()(ii) above.

                    repayment of subscriptions shall have priority in the distribution of the 
                    assets of the Fund. In meeting each such liability the Fund shall use its 
                    assets in the following order:
                        (a)  the currency in which the liability is payable;
                        (b) gold;
                        (c)  all other currencies in proportion, so far as may be prac-
                                 ticable, to the quotas of the members.
                      2. After the discharge of the Fund’s liabilities in accordance with 1 
                    above, the balance of the Fund’s assets shall be distributed and appor-
                    tioned as follows:
                        (a) (i) The Fund shall calculate the value of gold held on 
                                     August 31, 1975 that it continues to hold on the date 
                                     of the decision to liquidate. The calculation shall be 
                                     made in accordance with 9 below and also on the 
                                     basis of one special drawing right per 0.888 671 gram 
                                     of ifne gold on the date of liquidation. Gold equivalent 
                                     to the excess of the former value over the latter shall 
                                     be distributed to those members that were members 
                                     on August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on 
                                     that date.
                                (ii)  The Fund shall distribute any assets held in the Special 
                                     Disbursement Account on the date of the decision to 
                                     liquidate to those members that were members on 
                                     August 31, 1975 in proportion to their quotas on that 
                                     date. Each type of asset shall be distributed -                 propor
                                     tionately to members.
                        (b)  The Fund shall distribute its remaining holdings of gold

                                    but not in excess of, the amounts by which their quotas 
                                    exceed the Fund’s holdings of their currencies.

                                    not exceed iffty percent of its quota.
                          (d ) The Fund shall apportion the remainder of its holdings 
                                    of gold and each currency

                                        tion under 2(a) above shall not be taken into account 
                                        for determining the amounts due, and
                                   (ii)  any excess holdings of gold and currency among all 
                                        the members in proportion to their quotas.

                      tioned to other members under 2( d ) above, and shall agree with the  Fund 
                      within three months after a decision to liquidate upon an orderly proce-
                      dure for such redemption.
                        4.  If a member has not reached agreement with the Fund within the 
                      three-month period referred to in 3 above, the Fund shall use the - cur
                      rencies of other members apportioned to that member under 2(d ) above 
                      to redeem the currency of that member apportioned to other members. 
                      Each currency apportioned to a member which has not reached agree-
                      ment shall be used, so far as possible, to redeem its currency appor-

                      under 3 above.
                        5.  If a member has reached agreement with the Fund in accordance 
                      with 3 above, the Fund shall use the currencies of other members appor    -
                      tioned to that member under 2(d ) above to redeem the currency of that 
                      member apportioned to other members which have made agreements

                      redeemed in the currency of the member to which it was apportioned.

                      shall pay to each member the remaining currencies held for its account.
                                                                                               81

                      bers under 6 above shall redeem such currency in the currency of the 
                      member requesting redemption, or in such other manner as may be 
                      agreed between them. If the members involved do not otherwise agree, 
                      the member obligated to redeem shall complete redemption within ifve 
                      years of the date of distribution, but shall not be required to redeem in 
                      any half-yearly period more than one-tenth of the amount distributed to 
                      each other member. If the member does not fulifll this obligation, the 
                      amount of currency which should have been redeemed may be liqui-
                      dated in an orderly manner in any market.

                      persons in its territories. Each member so obligated agrees to compensate
                      other members for any loss resulting from the difference between the 
                      value of its currency in terms of the special drawing right on the date of

                      been increased to the full extent to which they could have been increased 
                      in accordance with Article III, Section 2(b) of this Agreement.
