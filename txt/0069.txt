                   * Sources are fragile and could be damaged by direct leak testing.  Leak tests are to therefore 
                   only be carried out on the inside of the container in which the source is stored, following the 
                   procedure described in local orders or as agreed with the RPA.  There is no minimum activity 
                   for a source below which a leak test is not required on a sealed source.  However, where it is 
                   indicated that a source does not require leak testing, this decision has been made on the basis 
                   that 100% ingestion of the source would not result in a dose greater than 0.1 mSv and 
                   therefore poses a trivial radiological hazard.

                      Upon submitting the leak test filter paper to DSTL for analysis, a certificate will be returned to 
                      the RSO containing the results.  The certificate should be filed in an appropriate place, for 
                      example with the radioactive source list.  The leak test frequency of these items is every two 
                      years with the exception of SICS Mk 10 NHA where the requirement is for an annual leak test. 
                       
                       
                      Procedure 
                       
                          1.  Regulation 27(3) of Ref. B requires that suitable leak tests are carried out to detect 
                              leakage from radioactive sources. There are many equipment items in service with the 
                              UK Armed Forces hat require such testing. 
                       
                          2.  The Radiation Safety Officer of each Ship, Unit or Establishment is to ensure that such 
                              items are correctly leak tested. 
                       
                          3.  Prior to taking a sample, a Ziploc plastic bag from the supplied kit should be marked 
                              with the following information: 
                       
                                A.  The date of taking the sample 
                                                                                                               Leaflet 9 Annex D

                           4.  Disposable gloves should be worn when taking the following sample. 
                        
                           5.  The leak test sample should be taken by wiping the area immediately surrounding a 
                                radioactive source with a small circular “filter” paper from the supplied pack. The 
                                purpose of this is to collect any potential escaping radioactive material. It is important to 
                                observe the following discipline: 
                        
                                  A.  Do not write on the filter paper 
                                  B.  Do not bend or tear the filter paper 
                                  C.  Do not moisten the filter paper with water or any other solvent 
                                  D.  Do not apply tape to or staple through the filter paper 
                        
                           6.  The paper should be placed in the Ziploc bag which was marked in step 3. This bag 
                                should then be sealed. 
                                          
                           7.  Once all items have been tested and samples obtained, all sealed bags should be 
                                placed together between two pieces of card to keep them flat. They should then be 
                                placed into the supplied pre-addressed envelope supplied in the pack.

                                should be completed with all relevant information and placed in the same envelope. 
                                The envelope should then be mailed to DSTL.
