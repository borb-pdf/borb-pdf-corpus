                          INTRODUCTION
                          THE PROMISE OF GLOBALIZATION
                          Globalization has spurned tremendous opportunities and challenges. It is no surprise 
                          Steve Jobs chose Tim Cook to succeed him in leading Apple. Tim Cook built Apple’s 
                          supply chain into what became one of the company’s greatest strategic advantages. 
                          Brands like Johnson and Johnson, ABB, Dell and Microsoft to name a few, all view 
                          supply chain management as nothing less than vital to their ability to innovate and dom                                                                                    -
                          inate global markets.
                          To take full advantage of modern technologies and compete successfully in what is 
                          quickly becoming a friction-free global marketplace, businesses must ensure automa-
                          tion of their processes with trading partners. Full automation requires addressing what 
                          we believe is the last mile of global electronic invoicing: local tax compliance. This white 
                          paper explains the role that local tax compliance plays in successful e-business initia-
                          tives and how leading global brands and governments are addressing this need.
                          THE ALLURE OF ELECTRONIC INVOICING
                          Most multi-national corporations strive to consolidate processes and supporting IT sys-
                          tems. They seek fewer platforms for enterprise resource planning, supply chain man-
                          agement and customer relationship management. Paper-based systems and processes 
                          are always a red lfag.
                          Automated invoicing initiatives — the “poster child” of paper elimination efforts — ad-
                          dress a very messy problem for large organizations. Eliminating paper invoices is very 
                          attractive with direct processing cost reductions of up to 90%. For most multi-national 
                          companies, some 5 – 25% of invoices are cross-border, the rest are multi-domestic 
                          where there is no escape from compliance with local rules in each country whose laws 
                          apply. Many corporations increasingly seek to manage such diverse invoice lfows from 
                          only one or a few central locations to optimize overall process eiffciency and effective-
                          ness. Electronic invoicing is often a key enabler for unlocking the larger beneifts of end-
                          to-end business process automation.
                          LEGALLY CRITICAL DOCUMENTS: ORPHANS OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION 
                          Some types of documents and transactions are not of interest to governments. Enter-
                          prises worldwide have in many cases dematerialized such documents many years or 
                          even decades ago. 
                          However, other documents such as invoices and other documents with a high legal or 
                          ifnancial importance have traditionally had a dual business and public function. Such 
                          documents could until fairly recently often not be processed or stored in electronic 
                          form only, because legal recognition required them to be on paper. Since the turn of the 
                          millennium this has started to change – many countries that previously prohibited the 
                          use of electronic media for such documents now permit them under stringent regulatory 
                          control mechanisms that are gradually being made compulsory. This new chapter in the 
                          evolution of global electronic trade and commerce is unique in that increasingly the 
                          majority of investment in the innovation and process transformation that underpins the 
                          mandatory adoption of paperless processing of these previous ‘orphans of the digital 
                          revolution’ comes from governments rather than business.
                                                                  Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management       4
                                                   INVOICING AND VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) COMPLIANCE
                                                   Many governments utilize invoices as primary evidence in determining ‘indirect’ taxes 
                                                   owed to them by corporations. These taxes, most of which are known as a value added 
                                                   tax (VAT), are reported and paid in full typically monthly or quarterly. VAT is by far the 
                                                   most signiifcant indirect tax for nearly all of the world’s trading nations. Roughly speak-
                                                   ing, VAT contributes more than 30% of all public revenue.
                                                   VAT as a tax method essentially turns private companies into tax collectors. The role 
                                                   of the taxpayer in assessing the tax is critical, which is why these taxes are sometimes 
                                                   referred to as “self-assessment taxes.” VAT depends on companies meeting public law 
                                                   obligations as an integral part of their sales, purchasing and general business opera-
                                                   tions. The dependency on companies to process and report VAT makes it necessary for 
                                                   tax administrations to audit businesses — but despite such audits, governments often 
                                                   collect 20-30% less VAT than they should due to fraud and malpractice.

                5         Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management
                The basic principle of VAT is that the government gets a percentage of the value add-
                ed at each step of an economic chain, which ends with the consumption of the goods 
                or services by an individual. While VAT is paid by all parties in the chain including that 
                end consumer, only businesses can deduct their input tax. Therefore, VAT requirements 
                concerning invoices ordinarily only apply between businesses. 
                     THE CONSEQUENCES OF VAT NON-COMPLIANCE
                     The consequences of non-compliance with VAT requirements can be signiifcant. As a result, most companies want to be as certain as 
                     possible that they can quickly and easily prove VAT compliance to avoid risks including:
                         Administrative ifnes. If a company cannot prove the veracity of invoices, it may be ifned. Trading partners who have been 
                          drawn into an audit that leads to this conclusion may also be penalized.
                         Sanctions under criminal law.  In some countries, non-compliance with invoicing requirements can be equated with tax eva -
                          sion, which is typically liable to sanctions (e.g. ifnes, imprisonment) under criminal law.
                         Protracted audits. Audits should generally take only a few days but many companies are audited for weeks or even months. 
                          This eats up precious expert resources and creates risks of more processes and documents being scrutinized and, potential          -
                          ly, found lfawed or lacking.
                         Spillover effects into other areas of taxation or accounting. Once a tax administration has established that a sales trans-
                          action cannot be evidenced, a company may also face sanctions in other areas of taxation. For example, non-recognition 
                          of an invoice for tax purposes may undermine the credibility of a company’s annual accounts or deductible expenses under 
                          corporate income tax.
                         Trading partner audits. The tax administration may have no choice but to verify the records and original documents of the 
                          audited company’s trading partners. This can negatively affect a company’s relationship with business partners.
                         Mutual assistance procedures. Auditors may need to call on their counterparts from other countries to obtain evidence 
                          about certain aspects of the company’s operations. Such procedures tend to be long and can tie up expensive expert re-
                          sources within a company for months or even years.
                         Loss of right to deduct V. A company that does not have suiffcient evidence of purchases — that cannot prove it was in AT
                          control of its processes at the time of the transactions — may need to pay back input VAT it reclaimed on such purchases. 
                          With an average VAT rate of 20%, this means a high risk of that company retroactively losing more than its proift margin.
                         Obligation to pay VAT over fraudulent invoices. If a fraudster can easily forge invoices that are not reasonably distinguish       -
                          able from a supplier’s normal invoices, a tax administration that has no credible evidence to the contrary may in extreme 
                          cases consider such invoices to have been issued by that supplier’s and claim output VAT payment if the buyer reclaimed 
                          the corresponding VAT.
                ELECTRONIC INVOICING COMPLIANCE TRENDS
                DEVELOPMENTS IN REGULATORY APPROACHES
                Electronic invoicing remains a fast-moving ifeld – primarily because of the rapid evo-
                lution of legal requirements, but naturally also because technological progress drives 
                continuous innovation in the business solution space. 
                In the 2015 edition of this white paper, we stated with some conifdence that the ifeld of 
                B2B invoicing is divided, on a high level, between on the one hand countries that have 
                a “post audit” system of VAT requirements for electronic invoicing and, on the other, 
                countries that employ a “clearance” methodology.

                                                   Over time we will likely see a variety of approaches to transaction-oriented tax con-
                                                   trols on invoices and other documents. For example, it is inevitable that the platforms 
                                                   that governments are rapidly adopting to receive and process electronic invoices from 
                                                   suppliers in public procurement transactions will start to be re-used for speciifc types 
                                                   of real-time controls: in Italy, for example, the B2G platform can from 2017 be used by 
                                                   suppliers for creating, sending and reporting their B2B invoices in one go.
                                                   This general trend is already massively impacting the very fabric of world trade. 
                                                   1. Convergence of clearance and B2B e Many B2B transactions xchange standards:
                                                   will over time have the government clearance platform as a “third trading partner”, and 
                                                   the exchanges with the clearance platform will be based on law, not standards. This will 
                                                   modify how we develop B2B data and process standards because the cost of maintain  -

                                                   in the same transaction will be prohibitive.
                                                   2. B2B process replication will drive convergence based on legal concepts: Govern-

                                                   types that are close-but-not-identical-to “the real thing” in B2B integration as we know 
                                                   it. For example, the law may require a goods receipt note with a speciifc content and 
                                                   in a speciifc format to be exchanged with the clearance platform at a speciifc point in 
                                                   the transaction – the content, form, timing and general purpose of that document may 
                                                   be very different from what parties exchange as a goods received note (GRN) in their 
                                                   existing B2B process. This duplication means that classic B2B process cycles will need 
                                                   to be re-engineered to meet the tax-driven demands of multiple clearance platforms 
                                                   depending on which law applies.

                                                   ‘form’ and ‘content’ compliance: if the government has access to every line item of every 
                                                   invoice (and in the future, likely: order, transport document, salary statement) there’s no

                                                   this will result in ‘tax engine’ functionality being applied at the same time as automated

                                                   examples of other documents and transaction types that will also be subject to real-time 
                                                   control requirements – just a few examples:
                                                      In Mexico, salary statements must be cleared just like invoices.

                                                      Secure cash registers for point-of-sale consumer transactions are already used in 
                                                       many countries worldwide. Increasingly, these machines will be designed to auto-

                                                   TOWARDS A ‘LAW ENFORCEMENT CLOUD’?
                                                   We are predicting that compulsory real-time controls on transactions of many different 
                                                   kinds will play a very important part in the race towards national ifscal prosperity that 
                                                   is fueled by globalization. This will bring about a lot of changes in the way businesses 
                                                   conduct their processes, internally and with each other – and what we see today is 
                                                   probably just the tip of the iceberg. Now that the value of real-time controls is consid-

                  in the deployment of emerging technologies to optimize and broaden these controls.

                  rights which, even if the scale and frequency of access change dramatically, no-one can 
                  successfully object to on legal grounds. What we are seeing today may very well be the 
                  contours of an emerging, massively heterogeneous ‘law enforcement Cloud’ that will be 
                  an integral part of many day-to-day activities of future generations.
                  BUSINESS TRENDS
                  When analyzing what the future may bring – which must be a critical component of 
                  any company’s strategy considerations – it is important to take into account one very 
                  signiifcant private sector trend that will impact how compliance will be managed as a 
                  topic in the future.
                  The internet and associated technologies have dramatically changed the busi-
                  ness-to-business integration methods that have in the past thirty years evolved among 
                  larger businesses: old-school peer-to-peer Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is still 
                  going strong, particularly in longer-term relationships between larger enterprises, but 
                  these interchange methods are now being supplemented and sometimes replaced with 
                  Cloud-based platforms that offer end-to-end procurement or order-to-cash process 
                  support that allow enterprises to connect more types of trading partners more lfexibly. 
                  Many vendors in the B2B space have started adopting network-based rather than peer-
                  to-peer approaches to trading partner management. This document does not have the 
                  ambition to analyze market trends among B2B integration and similar vendors; rather, we 
                  are mentioning this emergence of hosted transaction platforms because the concept of 
                  end-to-end business process management in the Cloud has far-reaching consequences 
                  for electronic invoicing compliance: until fairly recently, enterprises could manage VAT 
                  compliance through a combination of internal experts and tax advisers – tax experts 
                  would monitor legal evolution and work directly with the business and IT to ensure the 
                  necessary compliance change management. As the ownership of the business process 
                  moves to vendors of hosted end-to-end business processes, enterprises can no longer 
                  manage compliance the way they did when most of the IT and processes were still with                                -
                  in their direct control. Consequently, enterprises and vendors must work out between 
                  them who carries responsibility for speciifc compliance maintenance tasks. Depending 
                  on the regions for which an enterprises seeks to implement a vendor’s B2B services, 
                  the vendor will often be under pressure to take over the management of compliance 
                  with requirements that are closely associated with the functionality it provides. 
                  BUSINESS PROCESS CLOUD VS LAW ENFORCEMENT CLOUD?
                  One possible conclusion from the previous two main sections is that two fundamen-
                  tal types of heterogeneous Cloud-based concepts are emerging –a ‘law enforcement 
                  Cloud’ and a ‘business process Cloud’–  that together will be very inlfuential in shaping 
                  the way companies will conduct their processes and communicate with one another go                                  -
                  ing forward. How these two process environments can coexist productively will require 
                  a serious international conversation about convergence or harmonization in areas such 
                  as authentication, data standards, terminology, liability and service levels.

                   SOURCE DATA AND RECORDS
                   To prove the reliability of its accounts, a company must in most countries retain its 
                   source documents. This typically leads to distinct administrative subsystems with dif-
                   ferent functions:
                        Accounting records — the thing to prove: in most cases (where a company does 
                         not use cash basis accounting), a company’s accounts must accurately and com-
                         pletely record invoices when issued or received. These bookings are not invoic-
                         es themselves, even if accounting staff may sometimes call them that. In modern 
                         times, these records are retained in a company’s accounting system — either a 
                         software package or online service or a more complete Enterprise Resource Plan-
                         ning (ERP) system for larger companies.
                        The invoice — primary source of evidence — in case of doubt concerning the ve-
                         racity of a company’s accounts or correctness of the VAT treatment of supplies, 
                         an auditor will typically turn to the invoice source document and ask himself the 
                         question: are these the invoices exactly as exchanged at the time of the supply or 
                         have they been erroneously or fraudulently created, or modiifed? If the invoice is 
                         deemed reliable and there are no other reasons to suspect fraud or misconduct, 
                         the auditor can ordinarily conclude that the accounts and VAT administration are 
                         reliable. In other cases, an auditor may review complementary sources of evidence.
                        Complementary sources of evidence — in most countries, tax law also requires 
                         companies to maintain an orderly and auditable administration, which in practice 
                         often means that companies must meet general requirements under applicable 
                         accounting law. These requirements, in turn, may include a general obligation to 
                         retain all records that may be required to substantiate a company’s accounts. Trad                                  -
                         ing partners are not explicitly obligated to exchange formalized trade data (key 
                         pre-contractual, contractual and transaction data e.g. purchase orders) other than 
                         the invoice, which is compulsory, but if they do they should generally store these 
                         as well.
                   WHY WOULD A TAX ADMINISTRATION TRUST YOUR ACCOUNTS? 
                   One can distinguish among the following high-level categories of evidence.
                    A INTRINSIC (PORTABLE) EVIDENCE — In some cases, the integrity and authen-
                             ticity of the data object (paper or electronic document, or structured data) can be 
                             demonstrated without reference to other business data or processes.
                             This type of trustworthiness is based on intrinsic or logically associated fea-
                             tures of the ‘object’ constituting or carrying the business document in question; 
                             therefore, it is always portable. The storage or carrier medium (examples: sealed 
                             envelope; tamper-proof paper; encrypted communications channel) can ensure 
                             the integrity and authenticity of data between two communication or processing 
                             points, or at a speciifc point in time. When evidence is logically associated with 
                             the data (example: an advanced electronic signature), integrity and authenticity 
                             can be veriifable regardless of the storage or carrier medium and, in certain cas                               -
                             es, for a very long period of time. (Note that just trustworthiness of the storage 
                             system and processes, or the adding of technical veriifability to an invoice at the 
                             moment of storage, is almost never by itself suiffcient to ascertain integrity and 
                             authenticity because the invoice lifecycle does not begin with storage). The-

                                                                 a presumption of the taxable person’s accounts being based on reliable source

                                                                 When the business document itself does not convey conclusive evidence about 
                                                                 its integrity and authenticity, such evidence can arise from other sources in a

                                                         often regulated exclusively on the national level. National tax law often provides the

                   the often unique local fabric of public and private law, law enforcement processes and 
                   business practice that has evolved over many centuries and which are much harder to 
                   change than primary law. Naturally, negative decisions made in an audit process can be 
                   appealed in nearly all countries, but few administrative courts are suiffciently responsive 
                   for formal legal recourse to be a meaningful parameter from a business economics per                                         -
                   spective: the time to a ifnal decision is often measured in years. Businesses therefore 
                   generally tend to avoid taking interpretation risks in relation to tax law.
                   Where a taxable person has an explicit obligation to demonstrate the integrity and au-
                   thenticity of an invoice, the burden of proof for such invoice validity during the legal 
                   storage period is logically placed upon the taxable person. As we have seen above, if 
                   an invoice is complete and its integrity and authenticity can be ascertained, such proof 
                   will in many countries routinely be viewed as adequate and invoices are presumed to 
                   relfect actual supplies. However, the integrity, authenticity, legibility and completeness 
                   of an invoice do not by themselves conclusively prove a supply. Therefore, despite the 
                   correct appearance of an invoice, a tax administration may in certain circumstances 
                   decide to subject a company to more pervasive audits.
                   If, on the other hand, an auditor does not judge the invoice as such reliable, the tax ad-
                   ministration will nearly always pursue a more intrusive audit of other books and records 
                   so as to compensate for this evidence deifcit.
                   In many countries, the tax administration can also audit a taxable person’s local trading 
                   partner(s) if the evidence available at the taxable person being audited proves incon-
                   clusive. In cross-border situations, if justiifed due to questions about potential loss of 
                   revenue where tax liabilities could have arisen in a country but were not reported there, 
                   similar trading partner audits may be organized under mutual tax assistance treaties.
                   In addition to a ifnancial risk created by the duration and intrusion level of an audit, ad-
                   ministrative ifnes and/or loss of the buyer’s right to deduct input VAT, companies can run 
                   a reputational risk if they do not ensure a suiffcient level of auditability for VAT purposes.

                   With the advent of information technologies in the 1980s, businesses’ administrative 
                   practices were radically transformed. Typewriters were replaced by personal computers 
                   and printers. The invoice creation process used more standardized techniques – ifrst 
                   using word-processing software, followed later by desktop spreadsheet software which 
                   would facilitate invoice calculations. Just like the printer paper itself, the format, fonts 
                   and layout of invoices were increasingly uniform. Anyone with simple drawing software 
                   could fake or create colorful logos and produce professional-looking invoices. Invoice 
                   models would be stored on relatively unprotected PCs and could easily be reprinted 
                   and sent with e.g. different bank account information. Similarly, new photocopiers could 
                   render near-identical copies of any document, including invoices. Physical invoice de-
                   livery could be industrialized through professional agreements which would increas-
                   ingly involve private operators outside the public law or regulated sphere distributing a 
                   company’s invoices in a more dedicated process resulting in a somewhat greater attack 
                   surface.
                   A tax auditor who wants to verify that a company’s accounts are based on real invoices 
                   will still be pointed to the binder or box where the original tax invoice is stored. The 
                   invoice is still on paper, which may have physical qualities that can be of help in an audit 
                   process, however the intrinsic evidence value of the stored traditional invoice had been 
                   reduced from the old manual days.
                   Companies’ accounting systems had also evolved and, especially for larger compa-
                   nies, quickly became subsumed into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems which 
                   would tie several core business processes into a single system that re-used data based 
                   on deifned roles and controls. This development could make more information about 
                   the commercial process available to a tax auditor in a more convenient manner. While 
                   in many countries faxes may have been accepted as “original invoices-                                                                                                                                                     ” and, some
                   what later, it would be allowed to scan paper documents, this world of paper “originals” 
                   and separate accounting systems still maintained a sharp legal distinction between the 
                   books and the evidence of the books.
                   This era and its invoice methods create various challenges for tax administrations. Nei-
                   ther the stored invoice message nor the accounting system by themselves provides 
                   a suiffciently reliable single point of evidence. While payment often occurs by bank 
                   transfer, this process rarely leaves reliable traces that tax auditors can easily access 
                   over longer periods of time.
                                                                                                                                                   Primer on Post Audit Systems                         18

                                                                             it focuses on the auditability of the invoice as a discrete logical object. However, the

                   Since many companies whose evidence strategies are in this category will also have ba                                        -

                   or customer relationship management systems), tax auditability is further enhanced for 
                   cases where an auditor wants to investigate additional evidence that a supply actually 
                   took place — but this would not happen routinely due to the high trust level of the in-

                   Many medium-sized and larger companies have implemented a form of integrated elec                                            -
                   tronic data exchange for a portion of their transactions. In these cases the structured 
                   message rather than the paper becomes the ‘original invoice’. The invoice message 
                   must still be stored as received or (in many countries) sent, however the evidence of 
                   the invoice’s integrity and authenticity does not lie in the invoice as an object but rather 
                   in security processes that the parties have agreed to in the underlying interchange 
                   agreement. Often, this includes strict rules concerning the technical format and content 
                   of the invoice, as well as robust transport-level security in the channel over which the 
                   invoice is carried. When modern transport security standards are used, the data may, in 
                   addition to being sent over an encrypted channel, also be temporarily signed during the 
                   transmission. Since in all cases invoices are again technically unprotected when they 
                   leave such a point-to- point connection, parties must generally ensure that no uncon-
                   trolled steps occur in the end-to-end invoicing process whereby data could be exposed 
                   to change. Laws permitting this “EDI” method sometimes require the archiving system 
                   to be directly populated from the EDI system to avoid such lacunae and keep the attack 
                   surface to a minimum. Parties availing themselves of this option must naturally still en-
                   sure that the stored invoices can be presented in a human-readable format. 
                   Due to the fact that the invoice object carries no distinctive features permitting its in-
                   tegrity and authenticity to be independently veriifed, this method logically also requires 
                   parties to ensure that the interchange agreement be stored. Information that is required 
                   to prove that the interchange agreement rules were followed (e.g. sent/received logs; 
                   mapping tables where invoices are converted; third party system audit reports and data 
                   validation rules) must also remain auditable during the storage period.
                   Since many companies whose processes are in this category will also have basic or 
                   even sophisticated ERP systems as well as other (often not highly integrated) business 
                   process automation systems (e.g. order systems, inventory management or customer 
                   relationship management systems), tax auditability is further enhanced for cases where 
                   an auditor wants to investigate additional evidence. Such veriifcations may take place

               CLEARANCE SYSTEMS
               Figure 15 shows a number of high-level features and processes that many clearance 
               systems have in common. It should however be noted that this commonality is limited 
               in practice; many countries with a clearance system have implemented variations on 
               these ‘standard’ processes (see deep dive below). Below is an explanation of each 
               numbered step:
               1.    OK to issue? Typically the process starts with the supplier sending the invoice in a 
                     speciifed format to the tax administration or an agent licensed to act on its behalf. 
                     This invoice is ordinarily signed with a secret private key corresponding to a public 
                     certiifcate issued to the supplier — it is unusual for clearance systems to allow the 
                     initial signature to be created with a service provider’s signing key (Turkey being a 
                     notable exception).
               2.    Cleared for issuance The tax administration or its agent (e.                                                                .g. an accredited or 
                     licensed operator) will typically verify the signed supplier invoice-                                                                                                     , register it un
                     der a unique identiifcation number and apply its own signature (and sometimes 
                     time-stamp) on it. The resulting cleared invoice is returned to the supplier. In some 
                     alternative ‘lite clearance’ cases, the tax administration or its agent simply provide 
                     a unique identiifcation number or code that the supplier must add to the invoice.
               3.    Issue invoice to buyer.    Upon clearance, the invoice is sent or made available to the 
                     buyer. We call this approach “hard clearance” as the supplier MUST obtain -clear
                     ance before sending the invoice to the buyer. Recently some new clearance coun -
                     tries allow for “soft clearance” whereby suppliers are allowed to send the signed 
                     invoice to the buyer without clearance, but the supplier has a limited amount of 
                     hours to clear the invoice. Counter-intuitively, in some clearance countries there 
                     is no requirement for the invoice exchanged between business partners to be the 
                     cleared electronic invoice; in a good number of cases it is actually possible to is-
                     sue a paper representation that simply links to this electronically cleared invoice 
                     through e.g. a barcode.
               4.    Validate clearance Upon receipt of the invoice.                                   , the buyer is often obligated or 
                     encouraged to check with the tax administration or its clearance agent that the 
                     invoice received was issued in compliance with applicable requirements. In gener              -
                     al, the buyer usually handles integrity and authenticity control using crypto-tools, 
                     whereas clearance check is done at the tax administration or agent.
               5.    Conifrm clearance If the buyer has used an online system to perform the valida.               -
                     tion described in the previous step, the tax administration or agent will return an 
                     OK/not OK response to the buyer.

                  PRIMER ON CLEARANCE SYSTEMS
                  A TAXONOMY OF CLEARANCE MODELS IN GLOBAL B2B ELECTRONIC INVOICING
                  While conceptually the clearance process looks simple, our experiences after having 
                  investigated many countries show that there are several fundamental clearance lfavors, 
                  even inside countries. This section proposes a taxonomy of clearance models that can 
                  help electronic invoicing practitioners in discussions on global compliance.
                  First of all, a detailed analysis requires us to introduce the concept of electronic invoicing 
                  regime, in addition to electronic invoicing at country-level. The reason is that countries 
                  increasingly have different electronic invoicing systems. The most prominent example 
                  is Brazil where goods- (NF-e), transport (CT-e)- and service (NFS-e) electronic invoicing 
                  fall under different regulations and use different technologies; in our terminology these 
                  are each a separate regime. Further, each Brazilian municipality has the freedom to 
                  deifne its own electronic invoicing rules for supplies of services; these are referred to 
                  as sub-regimes. Turkey last year introduced a new regime called e-Arşiv, in addition to 
                  the B2B e-Fatura regime. Interestingly, while e-Fatura is clearance-based B2B for large 
                  enterprise buyers, e-Arşiv used the post-audit method for invoices sent to smaller and 
                  medium-sized businesses and consumer buyers. Another example: Ecuador has two 
                  co-existing regimes, with both hard clearance and soft clearance (see below).
                  The end-to-end clearance process can be summarized into 3 main steps: signing the 
                  e-invoice, transmission to the tax administration (TA), TA clearance and complementary 
                  operations. Below we provide more detail how regimes allow delegation of these steps 
                  to third parties.
                  Chile and Turkey allow delegation of signing to any third party registered in the country, 
                  who can sign with its own certiifcate. Peru, Colombia and Turkey explicitly allow and pro                          -
                  mote delegation of signing and clearance transmission to accredited service providers. 
                  Most Brazilian regimes allow any Brazilian legal entity holding a certiifcate to handle the 
                  transmission to the TA. Peru, Colombia, Turkey, South Korea and Taiwan have regulated 
                  the delegation of transmission of the invoice to the TA to accredited service providers 
                  (state agents). As for TA authorization of invoices, in most clearance regimes the TA is 
                  directly responsible for central clearance. Exceptions are Russia and Mexico, where 
                  the TAs have delegated the clearance to service providers that have to pass strict gov-
                  ernmental accreditation before becoming an authorized clearance state agent. Finally, 
                  once an invoice has been cleared, there could be additional operations like correction 
                  or cancelation. In Mexico, while the clearance process is delegated, cancelation is cen                            -
                  tralized at the TA. Common to all delegated models is that the state agents can (and 
                  often do) also act as Value Added Service providers offering complementary services 
                  outside the regulated functions, e.g. archiving.
                  An additional dimension as regards technology is homogeneity, i.e. whether the same 
                  technology can be used to access any clearance points. Brazil is homogeneous on the 
                  state-level, i.e. the same technology is used by all states for a given regime, reducing 
                  development/integration costs for companies operating in different states. However, 
                  at the municipality level, in general, it is heterogeneous as there is no single stand-
                  ard.  Some Brazilian cities are adopting the so-called ABRASF model in the pursuit of 
                  homogeneity. Mexico, Russia, Turkey, Taiwan and South Korea are heterogeneous – a 
                  company that has selected an accredited service provider can’t necessarily re-use the 
                  same technology to connect to another one. Due to the lack of homogeneity among 
                  Russian state agents, interoperability has not been possible. Therefore, the Russian TA 
                  has recently regulated a centralized state-agent to which all other state-agents must be 
                  connected in order to ensure e-invoice exchange between suppliers and buyers.
                  A technical aspect to consider is the clearance result returned by the TA. This could 
                                                                                             Primer on Clearance Systems     24
                                                be a convenient artifact that simpliifes the process of validating whether the e-invoice 
                                                was actually cleared at the TA. A good practice is shown by Mexico and Russia, where 
                                                a returned artifact is cryptographically protected with authenticity and integrity that can 
                                                be veriifed without contacting the TA – a process that can be easily automated. In other 
                                                regimes, no token is returned or the returned token is not protected; in these regimes 
                                                the TA must be contacted to validate the e-invoice.
                                                After or in conjunction with clearance, the invoice must be delivered to the buyer. In 
                                                some regimes, such responsibility falls under the TA or State Agent like in Brazil NFS-e, 
                                                Russia and Turkey. Other regimes put that responsibility on the supplier – this is the 
                                                case in e.g. Brazil NF-e/CT-e, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, South Korea and 
                                                Taiwan. Interestingly, most regimes use email for delivery to an address that has been 
                                                provided by the company during the registration process. Even though email systems 
                                                have evolved to become highly reliable, such e-invoices can get lost. In Turkey, the TA 
                                                forces its agents to implement web services for delivery.
                                                While in many cases the buyer has the possibility or obligation to verify that an invoice 
                                                has been cleared upon issuance, most clearance regimes don’t include any invoice 
                                                status data originating from the buyer in the actual clearance process. Russia, Chile and 
                                                Taiwan are examples of the few regimes that leverage technology to require such in-
                                                volvement from the buyer. Some countries offer both options depending on the type of 
                                                e-invoice. In Turkey, Temel invoices are supplier-side only whereas Ticari invoices allow 
                                                a buyer to accept or reject the invoice for a limited period of time on receipt. In Brazil, 
                                                goods invoices in the oil industry have buyer involvement beyond clearance validation; 
                                                this approach now appears to be spreading to other new clearance countries. In Peru, 
                                                the buyer must reject cleared invoices in certain situations. Colombia forces buyers to 
                                                explicitly accept or reject an e-invoice.
                                                Yet another aspect of clearance regimes is the availability of reverse operations or cor-
                                                rective processes. Explicit regulated invoice cancelation allows the buyer or supplier to 
                                                reverse the clearance, resulting in a no-VAT operation on condition that VAT has not yet 
                                                been paid to the TA. Other clearance regimes have regulated debit/credit notes as part 
                                                of the electronic invoicing framework.
                                                Finally, we note that while many countries still use the term “electronic invoicing”, the 
                                                actual scope goes beyond just invoicing and may today cover other documents related 
                                                to same transaction such as credit/debit notes, delivery notes, waybills, ledgers, and 
                                                accounting documents. Actually, some countries have changed the “e-invoice” term. 
                                                In Russia, the framework is actually called electronic document exchange. In Chile the 
                                                term Electronic Fiscal Document is used.
                                                We notice a general trend in clearance countries that tax administrations – in their efforts 
                                                to gain more control over VAT revenue sources and prevent tax evasion – are e-        xtend
                                                ing their mandates to cover more ifscal documents that must include regulated content 
                                                and must be issued following worklfows that don’t necessarily match the corresponding 
                                                business document contents and associated worklfows for B2B purposes, resulting in 
                                                two different parallel processes that are forced to co-exist. This situation is exacerbated 
                                                by another trend whereby some tax administrations are demanding accreditation and 
                                                local presence of service providers who want to offer outsourced clearance services; 
                                                this can be challenging for international B2B operators without a local presence in each 
                                                country for which they support invoicing processes.

                          ARCHIVING CONSIDERATIONS
                          This white paper describes the proliferation and complexity of different models for reg -
                          ulating electronic invoicing around the world. While just a few years ago one may have 
                          been justiifed in believing that uniformity of approaches was in reach within regions like 
                          the European Union, the economic uncertainties that make tax collection such a major 
                          factor in today’s geopolitical situation have severely reduced the probability of regula-
                          tory convergence in any part of the world. 
                          It is however important to note that archiving rules are less affected by this extreme 
                          fragmentation of rules concerning the actual invoicing process; indeed, while require-
                          ments as regards archiving also differ from country to country-                                                                                                                                                                                         , archiving – which ob
                          viously is focused on keeping tax-critical information available to tax administrations 
                          once such information has served its purposes in the actual transaction process – is by 
                          its very nature less conducive to the types of fundamentally different requirements that 
                          exist around the actual invoicing process. Consequently, archiving is also a much better 
                          candidate for taking a ‘superset’ approach to the requirements of all applicable laws in 
                          one system, without a signiifcant need for logic to apply certain types of functionality to 
                          some categories of invoices and not other. In other words, it is possible to use a single 
                          archiving approach (and from a logical perspective: a single archive) across any busi-
                          ness’s operations. This feature makes the archive – the end point of all transactions, no 
                          matter how diverse – a good starting point for a concrete evaluation of a company’s 
                          electronic invoicing strategy.
                                  Figure 16 - A good legal archive can serve as the common end point of all electronic (and 
                           scanned paper) invoicing transactions anywhere, making it an excellent starting point for a com-
                                                                                  pany’s electronic invoicing strategy.
                          To take such a superset approach, the following high-level categories of archiving re-
                          quirements must be considered:
                          COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION – the archive system should have comprehensive documenta                                                                                              -
                          tion so that an auditor can ascertain the overall compliance of the archive and associated process                                                                             -
                          es. This documentation must be maintained over time and changed if laws, systems or processes 
                          evolve.
                          STRONG LOGICAL SEPARATION OF LEGAL/VAT ENTITIES   – there must be adequate separation 
                          among the logical areas where data for each VAT-relevant legal entity in a corporation is archived. 
                          It should be possible to restrict auditor access to one such legal entity.
                          SEARCH ON MANDATORY INVOICE CONTENT – an auditor must be able to search on key man                                                                                             -
                          datory ifelds.
                          SEARCH ON DATE RANGES, TRADE PARTNERS ET – an auditor must be able to search for C
                          invoices between certain dates, and by trading partner.
                                                                         Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management              26
                                                         INVOICE PRESERVATION – where applicable, country-speciifc requirements for applying speciifc 
                                                         procedures for the long-term veriifability of archived e-invoice must be met.
                                                         INTEGRITY & AUTHENTICITY EVIDENCE FEATURES – an auditor should be able to verify the 
                                                         integrity and authenticity of archived invoices through stored data other than the invoice itself. 
                                                         Depending on the applicable law, this typically concerns electronic signatures and/or audit trail 
                                                         documentation; either of these evidence types may be mandatory or part of a company’s choices 
                                                         as to how to meet VAT requirements. It is generally important that the evidence for compliance with 
                                                         core VAT electronic invoicing requirements be archived under the same security practices as the 
                                                         invoice itself. Such core evidence should also be capable of being presented in a similar manner 
                                                         and time frame as the invoice, and ideally through the same graphical interface. 
                                                         STORAGE PERIOD – logic must be available to retain invoices for as long as required under tax, 
                                                         commercial and accounting law, but not exceeding that period in order to ensure conformity with 
                                                         privacy legislation.
                                                         AUDIT ACCESS RIGHTS – a legal entity under audit must be able to create and remove exclusive 
                                                         auditor access rights.
                                                         STORAGE LOCATION – rules concerning the physical location of original invoices must be met. 
                                                         Template documentation should be available to facilitate administration procedures for legal enti-

                                                         PRINTABILITY – an auditor must in many countries be able to print invoices from the archive.
                                                         CONVERSION TO MANDATORY FORMATS FROM ARCHIVE – where requirements exist for the 
                                                         taxable person to be able to present an invoice in a speciifed structured format, features should be

       GRANULAR ANALYSIS
       This section describes a number of features based on which e-invoicing regulatory re-
       gimes can be compared with one another. Figure 17 and Figure 18 below provide a 
       schematic overview of the principal legal requirement categories and features for many 
       of the countries proifled in this white paper. Below we provide a brief description of the 
       analysis methodology used for rating in each of the categories.

                                                   A value of 100 is allocated where a country requires businesses to ensure and be able 
                                                   to demonstrate (a) the integrity of all mandatory ifelds of an invoice and (b) the authen-
                                                   ticity of its origin (the identity of the supplier or, where allowed, the third party acting on 
                                                   its behalf) during the legal lifetime of an invoice. A value between 0 and 100 is allocated 
                                                   where such requirements are generally assumed but not explicit in the law, or if there is 
                                                   a formal policy within the tax administration not to seek such evidence.

                 CLEARANCE
                 A value of 100 is allocated if an electronic invoice must be sent to the tax administration 
                 or its licensed/accredited agent for authorization prior to issuance as an original tax 
                 invoice. A value between 0 and 100 is allocated if clearance is required within a rela-
                 tively short time before instead of before the transaction, or in cases of less intrusive 
                 clearance processes e.g. requirements for a code to be fetched from an online tax ad-
                 ministration service and integrated into a tax invoice instead of the whole invoice being 
                 sent to the clearance service.
                 CLEARANCE + BUYER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
                 A value of 100 is allocated if the clearance process is legally only considered complete if 
                 the buyer has sent the tax administration or its licensed/accredited agent a conifrmation 
                 that it has received and validated the invoice.
                 FULL CYCLE CLEARANCE
                 A value of 100 is allocated in case the tax administration or its licensed/accredited agent 
                 not only clears the invoice but also serves as transport mechanism or access point for 
                 the buyer to obtain the cleared invoice.
                 ACCOUNTING DOCUMENT COMPLIANCE
                 A value of 100 is allocated in case the clearance process for invoices also applies to 
                 certain other formalized B2B/accounting documents if sent electronically.
                 ARCHIVING
                 A value of 100 is allocated in case there is a requirement for an electronic invoice to be 
                 archived for subsequent tax administration auditing purposes. A value between 0 and 
                 100 is allocated where archiving requirements exist but the period is very short (less 
                 than a year), or it if such archiving is viewed as more of a formality which the tax admin                    -
                 istration does not typically pay attention to.
                 MANDATORY XML
                 A value of 100 is allocated when a country speciifes an XML-based invoice schema as 
                 the exclusive format for an electronic invoice original.
                 TAX AUTHORIZATION NEEDED
                 A value of 100 is allocated where a country requires that the tax administration, Finance 
                 Ministry or other part of the public administration (including law enforcement) explicitly 
                 authorizes a business before it starts sending and/or receiving invoices electronically. 
                 A value between 0 and 100 is given if such authorization requirement is conditional, 
                 implicit, recommended or customary.
                 E-INVOICING MANDATE
                 A value of 100 is allocated in cases where all businesses must by law use invoices 
                 in electronic format. A value between 0 and 100 is given if such a mandate does not 
                 address all businesses or if the mandate is not all-encompassing in terms of types of 
                 invoices, business processes etc.
                 PRESCRIPTIVENESS
                 A value of 100 is allocated where a country leaves no choice to businesses as to how 
                 to achieve e-invoicing compliance. A value 0 means complete freedom of choice as to 
                 the method used by businesses to comply. A value between 0 and 100 is given if the 
                 applicable legal regime falls in between these two extremes.
                                                                                                        Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management                                            30

                                                                                under certain conditions be replaced with technologies and/or processes that provide

                COUNTRY PROFILES
                ELECTRONIC INVOICING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
                DIRECTIVE 2010/45: THE REGIME IN EFFECT SINCE 1 JANUARY 2013
                Six years after the entry into force of the Directive 2001/115, which introduced electronic 
                invoicing for VAT purposes in the European Union (EU), Member States in 2010 adopted 
                a Directive 2010/45 which modiifes certain provisions of the VAT Directive 2006/112 
                in relation to invoicing [REF 1]. The Directive 2010/45 entered into force on 1 January 
                2013, and among other things aimed to create “equal treatment” between paper and 
                electronic invoices. The base requirement (unchanged from the previous Directive) of 
                ensuring integrity and authenticity now explicitly applies to invoices in any form, instead 
                of only to electronic invoices as was the case under the 2001 Directive.
                There is no such thing as meaningful business compliance with an EU Directive since a 
                Directive has to be transposed into national legislation in order to have full legal effect. 
                For electronic invoicing, what matters are the local requirements applied by local tax 
                authorities to meet the objectives set by a Directive. These requirements in local VAT 
                laws are inlfuenced by adjacent legal areas, jurisprudence, law enforcement practices, 
                and industry self-regulation.
                Legal deifnitions and requirements, for example the concepts ‘reliable audit trail be-
                tween an invoice and a supply’ and ‘EDI’ (see descriptions below), may differ among EU 
                Member States. Importantly, the legal and business deifnitions of these concepts are 
                often not identical.
                SCOPE OF APPLICATION: ALL INVOICES?
                In principle, the invoicing provisions of the VAT Directive apply to all business- to-busi-
                ness invoices issued in the EU, including VAT-exempted transactions. Within the EU 
                there are two types of VAT exemptions: (1) zero-rated transactions, formally called trans                 -
                actions exempt with the right to deduct input VAT; and (2) fully-exempted transactions 
                applicable to certain charities, as well as postal and other services. In both cases, an 
                invoice must, in principle, be issued, usually with a reference to the legal basis for the 
                exemption applied. However, Member States have a right to release taxable persons 
                from the obligation of issuing an invoice, in which case there are no invoice-speciifc 
                                 3
                requirements .
                VAT-exempted transactions for which parties are released from the obligation of issuing 
                an invoice are very rare in mainstream business, as are exemptions for VAT-able invoic                    -
                   4
                es . Since issuing an invoice is not prohibited in either case, most companies would 
                rather not create a system exception for these cases. Only organizations that fall under 
                such releases for a large portion of their invoices might consider taking a system excep                  -
                tion into account to avoid creating an invoice altogether.
                Even if an invoice is issued in relation to VAT-exempted transactions, the Directive’s re-

              (B2B) automation. While the dividing line may be somewhat artiifcial, it is clear that 
              systems which are not highly automated – including invoices that are not machine- 
              readable – will generally not be viewed as EDI. Based on the ifrst criterion, technologies 
              such as Web EDI (where one transacting partner manually keys in, supplements and/
              or approves invoice data) and manual procedures used in self-billing setups will not be 
              eligible for the EDI compliance option in many countries, even if the trading partners 
              involved consider the transactions in question to be part of their EDI system.
              Whichever deifnition of EDI is used, the concept of EDI is never deifned as a security 
              technology. In modern industry deifnitions, security is not a necessary component of 
              EDI at all: trading partners may very well have discontinued the Value Added Network 
              (VAN) they originally used for their EDI system and, instead, run the same transactions 
              over the unprotected internet, while continuing to refer to the system as EDI.
              Importantly, the fact that a system can legally qualify as EDI (which is a deifnitional mat-
              ter) says nothing about the guarantees it provides for electronic invoice integrity and 
              authenticity (which is a compliance matter). For the purposes of ensuring integrity and 
              authenticity of electronic invoices, a compliant EDI process must be based on an inter-
              change agreement (also called trading partner agreement or EDI agreement) providing 
              “for the use of procedures guaranteeing the authenticity of the origin and integrity of 
              the data.” What these procedures should be is not well deifned in most Member States.

                         2.       If not, what is my “evidence deifcit” and how can I cost-effectively remedy it?
                         What is cost-effective varies greatly depending on circumstances. Every company and 
                         trading relationship is different. Figure 19 below presents a diagram that can help with 
                         these choices.

               TREND TOWARDS MANDATORY B2G ELECTRONIC INVOICING
               The EU has in the past years focused more of its attention in relation to electronic 
               invoicing on invoices for public procurement transactions – both in pursuit of process 
               optimization and to provide a boost to the adoption of electronic invoicing between 
               businesses. A comprehensive package of policy and more practical measures is being 
               introduced by Brussels, whereby all EU countries’ public administrations will need to be 
               able to receive e-invoices at least for public procurement transactions by 2018 (through 
               EU Directive 2014/55). At the same time several EU Member S-                                                                       tates are also active
               ly experimenting with mandatory electronic invoicing for B2G. Examples are countries 
               like Spain, Italy and Slovenia, which have created technical platforms and associated 
               speciifcations simply mandating qualiifed electronic signatures and speciifc transmis-
               sion methods for suppliers that invoice the public sector. Other countries take a more 
               lfexible approach and stay closer to the integrity and authenticity options provided by 
               the VAT Directive. France is the ifrst country to have taken concrete regulatory steps 
               towards extending the requirement (starting in 2017) for public sector entities to receive 
               e-invoices, to cover also the private sector.

                 Figure 21 - Overview of status of electronic invoicing regulation in public e-procurement in the 
                EU. Both France and Estonia have announced 2017 as the start dates for mandatory electronic 
                                                  invoicing to the public sector.
               Directive 2014/55 furthermore lays a foundation for technical standardization of the 
               content of B2G electronic invoices – both semantically and in terms of speciifc support             -
               ing syntaxes. A technical committee (CEN TC 434) of the European standards body CEN 
               is working hard to meet the standards mandate set out in the aforementioned Directive. 
               Once these standards are adopted, the public administration and certain other public 
               bodies in EU Member States must accept electronic invoices that conform to them.

                                                   The evolution towards interoperable EU-wide electronic public procurement is also e-  x
                                                   pected to be aided by the increasing uptake of PEPPOL in Member States. The PEPPOL 
                                                   project was initiated in 2008 and focused on a way for diverse national e-procurement 
                                                   systems in the EU Member States to interconnect, thereby supporting the notion that 
                                                   the public sector should be able to select and easily conduct business with vendors 
                                                   from any Member State. PEPPOL is essentially a stack of speciifcations that ensure this 
                                                   interoperable exchange of electronic procurement documents through, among other 
                                                   things, the concept of service providers acting as ‘access points’. At the end of August 
                                                   2012, the PEPPOL project was ifnalized and its services and responsibilities were taken 
                                                   over by the non-proift association OpenPEPPOL, which continues to evolve the PEPPOL

                                                   Speciifcations; and the PEPPOL Transport Infrastructure Agreements.

                                                   with VAT or accounting law requirements, since the VAT Directive does not regulate 
                                                   this area. Non-compliance with invoicing requirements speciifcally, may lead to severe

                                                   per incorrect invoice, penalties in bulk, penalties depending on the VAT amount or total 
                                                   amount of the invoice, through individual responsibility of the company’s personnel (e.g. 
                                                   members of the board or ifnancial oiffcers), to criminal law implications. A couple of EU 
                                                   Member States lack precise regulation on this matter and instead the consequences 
                                                   for non-compliance are imposed by the tax authority or administrative courts after their 
                                                   assessment of the case at hand. To give a couple of examples: Cyprus imposes a fee 
                                                   of 85 EUR per each incorrectly issued invoice; in Spain incorrect invoices are subject 
                                                   to a penalty of 1% of the total amount of all invoices wrongly issued; in Poland issuing 
                                                   invoices not in accordance with all legal requirements may amount to a bulk penalty 
                                                   of 219,000 EUR; in Slovenia a penalty ranging between EUR 2,000 and EUR 125,000 
                                                   may be imposed in case a legal person fails to issue an invoice or fails to provide the 
                                                   authenticity of origin, integrity of content and legibility of invoices during the prescribed

                  France has not explicitly transposed the “any other means” option of Directive 
                   2010/45, but rather expects methods that are not Qualiifed Electronic Signature or 
                   EDI to be classiifable as business controls-based audit trails linking an invoice and 
                   a supply.

                  When using a service provider it is required to authorize the outsourcing of invoice 
                   issuance. Such an outsourcing mandate/authorization can be either explicit or tacit, 
                   however an explicit authorization remains recommended. If the mandate is tacit 
                   an outsourcing statement (“issued by… on behalf of…”) should be included in the 
                   content of each invoice. The service provider can be established abroad, however, 
                   stricter rules apply to the outsourcing mandate/authorization when the service pro    -

                        The electronic invoice and conifrmation of receipt must be issued and exchanged

                         invoices and PADs. In the past, different schemas/formats were prescribed despite 
                         the fact of signiifcant overlap in invoice and PAD contents. The fragmented legacy 
                         formats can still be used until the middle of 2017.
                        Interoperability between EDEOs is regulated, but not widely commercially available

                           Electronic invoicing for VAT purposes has been permitted since 2012 in Russia. A VAT e-invoice is a ifle in the established XML sche                                 -

                           (‘EDEO’). EDEOs are companies that provide services for exchange of open and conifdential information via telecommunication 
                           channels. 
                           The authenticity of origin and integrity of content of the e-invoice must be guaranteed by means of an electronic signature that must 
                           be based on a qualiifed certiifcate issued by a locally accredited Certiifcation Authority. The signature should be that of an author-
                           ized representative of the supplier. Technically, the supplier may however delegate the authority to sign the e-invoice electronically 
                           on the basis of a power of attorney. The necessary software/hardware equipment for signing must be located in Russia, either at the 
                           supplier’s premises or at the EDEO. The party performing the signing operation must have a license to operate crypto equipment and 
                           Russian authorities must have a possibility to conduct physical audits and controls, on Russian soil.
                           E-invoices must be stored in the same form and format in which they were issued. 
                           Both trading partners must store e-invoices for four years from the end of the accounting period. The law imposes an additional 
                           storage requirement on EDEOs: they must store ‘the information and data’ on the e-invoice exchange for at least four years.
                           The authenticity of origin and integrity of content of an e-invoice must be guaranteed throughout the storage period. Furthermore, 
                           the data guaranteeing the authenticity of origin and integrity of content of the e-invoice must also be stored. In addition to the 
                           e-invoice it is necessary to store, in particular, technical messages generated by the EDEO(s), the supplier, and the buyer within the 
                           e-invoice exchange process, e.g. conifrmations and notiifcations of sending or receipt, the qualiifed certiifcate, veriifcation key, etc.

                  Electronic invoicing is mandatory in Ukraine.
                  An invoice must be signed with an electronic signature of the supplier’s authorized 
                   representative, and, where available, with an electronic seal of the supplier. These 
                   are based on advanced certiifcates issued by accredited certiifcation authorities.
                  The required electronic invoice format is XML.
                  An electronic invoice must be registered in the Uniifed Register of Tax Invoices 
                   (URTI).
                  In order to be able to register the invoice in URTI, the supplier needs to sign up for 
                   electronic document exchange with the tax authority, and use special software for 
                   submitting the electronic invoice to the tax authority for veriifcation and registration 
                   in URTI and for subsequent sending the electronic invoice to the buyer.
                  Outsourcing of signing of the electronic invoice is allowed to a person authorized 
                   by the supplier by virtue of a notarized power of attorney.

                  The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has issued a series of circulars on electronic

                   tronic invoices.
                  The relevant processes prior to storage must ensure adequate controls to safe-
                   guard the accuracy, security and integrity of the data processed and kept in the 
                   system.
                  Documentation describing the relevant operating and business systems, including 
                   how transactions are processed and records kept and managed, must be available.
                  Audit trails must be available during the storage period, including electronic signa  -
                   tures and results from other security measures for the end-to-end process.
                  Records should be kept in a manner that ensures accessibility, security, accuracy, 
                   integrity, authenticity and reliability. Records should be based on non-proprietary, 
                   commonly used data interchange standards and readable with CRA audit software.
                  Back-up records are to be maintained at all times. It is considered good practice 
                   to keep back-ups at a location other than the business location for security and 
                   precautionary purposes. Storage abroad is permitted only after derogation from 
                   the CRA.

               is different in Latin America, where electronic invoicing compliance consists of follow-
               ing unambiguous technical speciifcations and adoption deadlines. In such circumstanc                -
               es, compliance becomes a rather binary proposition: an invoice is either issued or re-
               ceived in conformity with the rules or it is not. The consequences of issuing or receiving 
               non-compliant invoices are therefore also in many cases much more direct and tougher 
               than in other regions, for example:
                    Administrative penalties for non-compliance can in certain cases exceed the trans             -
                     action value. In Brazil, for example, non-compliance with certain rules can be penal          -
                     ized up to 150% of the value of the supply.
                    Non-compliance is relatively quickly equated with tax evasion, which means that 
                     executives of repeat offenders may be imprisoned and their companies may be 
                     temporarily or permanently closed down.

               as to leverage global best practices and seamlessly integrate with strate-
               gic e-business platforms. These ambitions are stymied by a number of cum-
               bersome characteristics of the Latin American electronic invoicing market. 
                
               FRAGMENTATION ABOUNDS AND SOLUTIONS ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOCAL
               Tax administrations in Latin America cooperate in different ways, but the fundamen-
               tal architecture of the regulation and control infrastructure varies signiifcantly from 
               country to country. This means that a company doing business across a number of 
               Latin American countries has to adopt processes and messages that are specif-
               ic for every jurisdiction. In addition, the legislation often operates from the assump-
               tion that companies maintain their own local ERP systems and do not leverage mod-
               ern network-based process consolidation strategies. These factors, compounded 
               by the speed with which national systems have been put in place and made man-
               datory, has led businesses to adopt highly localized software-based solutions for in-
               tegration towards mandatory tax administration-controlled pre-registration servic-
               es. The deployment time for local companies to set up and operate such software 
               components can be long due to technology integration and onboarding issues. 
               SOLUTION PERFORMANCE IS DRIVEN BY LEGISLATION RATHER THAN GLOBAL 
               MARKET METRICS
               Another reason why many modern enterprises ifnd electronic invoicing in Latin Ameri-
               ca challenging is that the pre-registration requirements create a performance depend-
               ency on the tax administration – a regulatory agency with extensive powers, acting 
               as part of a sovereign State. Even when the tax administration does not operate sys-
               tem components fronting tax payers, the accredited private sector vendors providing 
               such services on their behalf (e.g. PACs in Mexico) often view the law rather than cus-
               tomer needs as their ultimate requirement speciifcation. Global best practices in re-
               lation to service levels are therefore diiffcult to uphold in the L                                                                                          atin American market.
                
               KEEP TRACK OF CHANGING INVOICE SCHEMAS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS
               In a continent that has chosen to create an intimate relationship between tax require-
               ments and technical implementation of control infrastructures, many legal changes can 
               impact the way enterprise systems address compliance. In the past ifve years, the change 
               rate in many Latin American countries’ electronic invoicing requirements has been high. 
               It has not been easy for enterprises and their solution vendors to adapt to and test 
               legal changes affecting systems with signiifcant dependencies on backend accounting 
               and logistics systems. This makes Latin American electronic invoicing challenging also 
               from the perspective of implementing industry best practices for change management.

                                             In the last years, Brazil has been making it mandatory to substitute different types of paper invoices called Fiscal 
                                             Notes with Electronic Fiscal Notes (pt.: Nota Fiscal Electronica). Which type of electronic ifscal note should be is-
                                             sued depends on the type of tax that must be documented since states and municipalities have their own different 
                                             requirements. For this reason, as well as from a document perspective, Brazil’s system can be divided into three 
                                             main frameworks: 
                                             1.    Nota Fiscal Electronica (NF-e) and Nota Fiscal Electronica Consumidor (NFC-e) for documenting transactions 
                                                   related to circulation (sale) of goods taxed with ICMS at a State level.
                                             2.    Conhecimiento de Transporte Electronico (CT-e). For documenting the provision of interstate and inter-munic                -
                                                   ipal transport services (also State level). 
                                             3.    Nota Fiscal de Servicios Electronica (NFS-e) for documenting transactions related to ISSQN at a municipal 
                                                   level. The responsibility of collecting the tax for NFS-e falls under the scope of each municipality within the 
                                                   country. Therefore, each municipality has its own legislation and system requirements to issue NFS-e.
                                              
                                             NF-e/NFC-e and CT-e basic requirements
                                              
                                             At a high level, these three types of invoices follow similar issuance requirements. To issue electronic invoices tax-
                                             payers must get previous authorization (pt.: credenciamiento) from the tax authority.
                                              
                                             It is mandatory to use an XML format. Furthermore, the invoice must be signed using a digital certiifcate issued to 
                                             the supplier by a certiifed local Certiifcation Authority. The invoice must be sent to the tax authority who will clear it 
                                             by issuing an authorization code. An auxiliary document must be issued to accompany the goods in transit. In the 
                                             case of goods it is named DANFE. For invoices issued by transport companies, the auxiliary document is known as 
                                             DACTE. Finally, suppliers must communicate the invoice to the buyer after the invoice has been authorized by the 
                                             tax authority. Taxpayers must archive invoices for 5 years.
                                             Upon receipt of the invoice, the buyer must validate it before using it to support the tax declaration. In addition to 
                                             validation, it is mandatory for buyers of certain industry sectors to issue a message known as Manifestação do 
                                             Destinatário (en.: Recipient’s Manifestation), which documents the buyer’s reaction to the operation described by 
                                             the invoice. It generates a proof only for the tax authority and not between the parties. Such messages can be 
                                             the following: 1) Conifrmation of the Operation; 2) Transaction not performed (e.g. returned goods), 3) Denial of the 
                                             transaction (e.g. transaction never existed). Each manifestation has a speciifc legal time frame to be issued counted 
                                             from the moment of acknowledgment of the existence of the transaction. 
                                             Finally, taxpayers issuing NF-e and CT-e may also be under the obligation to issue another document called Fiscal 
                                             Documents Manifest or MDF-e (pt.: Manifesto Eletrônico de Documentos Fiscais). Its purpose is to trace ifscal doc-
                                             uments during transport and it is issued by one of the parties to the transaction or by the transport company and is 
                                             communicated only to the tax authority, but does not constitute an invoice. It must be digitally signed by the issuer 
                                             (supplier, buyer or the carrier) and authorized by the tax authority where the issuer is registered as a taxpayer. 
                                             The law establishes an auxiliary document named DAMDFE to accompany the transport as a printed graphical 
                                             representation of the MDF-e.

                                             The NFS-e framework is heavily fragmented since each municipality has its own requirements. There is an attempt 
                                             to harmonize all frameworks conducted by the Brazilian State Capital Municipalities Association (pt.: Associação 
                                             Brasileira das Secretarias de Finanças das Capitais -Abrasf). Nevertheless, since municipalities may adopt Abrasf’s 
                                             standards voluntarily and partially, fragmentation still remains. All matters related to the issuance of Nota Fiscal de 
                                             Serviços Eletrônica (NFS-e), are processed within the municipalities’ service environments. 
                                              
                                             As a general rule, NFS-e issuance is mandatory for most taxpayers (with some exceptions such as autonomous 
                                             professionals, e.g. in Rio de Janeiro). In order to issue electronic invoices taxpayers must get prior authorization 
                                             from the municipal tax authority. 
                                              
                                             The NFS-e is issued via and stored by the municipal system. Taxpayers must input data either manually through the

      59  Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management
      ELECTRONIC INVOICING IN ASIA PACIFIC 
      A couple of trends in the ifeld of electronic invoicing have emerged during the last few 
      years in the Asia Paciifc region. 
       
      COMMON LAW LEGACY VS. CLEARANCE COUNTRY INSPIRATION 
      Places with a strong common law legacy, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, tend to 
      focus regulatory measures on record retention, which translated to electronic invoic-
      ing means that there often are few rules related to electronic invoice issuance, but 
      more controls around the e-archive. Malaysia is a notable example where the archiving 
      requirements have been written in such a way that a digital signature appears to be 
      the only way to fulifl the need to ensure authenticity in the archive, whereas no specif-
      ic requirements apply to the actual issuance of the invoice.
      On the other side of the spectrum are countries that have glanced at the success 
      stories in Latin America and that either intend to implement, or are already well on 
      their way of implementing, clearance-like electronic invoicing systems. In other words, 
      electronic invoicing is partially or completely mandatory and the control infrastructure 
      of electronic invoice issuance centers around government clearance in one way or 
      another. In this category one can ifnd countries such as China, Azerbaijan, Taiwan and 
      Indonesia. 
      TAX REFORMS ON THE RISE 
      Malaysia serves as an interesting example of recent legal developments in Asia also 
      by its introduction of a Goods and Service Tax (GST) in April 2015. Indirect taxes are 
      emerging in several Asian geographies where there historically were none. 
      Several states in the Middle East have publicly announced the introduction of VAT in 
      the near future; under the umbrella of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the mem-
      ber States UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait have been working 
      towards a simultaneous adoption of VAT. The GCC has agreed on a common frame-
      work by means of mutual treaties, the Excise Tax and VAT treaties, which will form the 
      basis for national legislation in each Member State, entering into force within a one to 
      three year period. 
      The trend towards VAT is not unique for oil-producing countries; the world’s biggest 
      manufacturers, such as China and India, have also been reviewing their tax systems 
      during the past years, which in India led to the long-awaited adoption of GST in 2016. 
      (Certain formal steps in the legislature process remain until GST will be in force; 
      speculations predict entry into force between April and October 2017.) India has been 
      struggling with a complex tax structure that has hampered the manufacturing industry 
      by taxing the sale of goods between states and thereby causing a high risk for double 
      taxation. China, while having had VAT in force for a long time, earlier this year decided 
      to increase the scope of VAT, making industries that were previously subject to Busi-
      ness Tax now taxable under VAT instead.
                                                                                         Tax-compliant Global Electronic Invoice Lifecycle Management                             60
