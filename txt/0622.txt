The OECD is a unique forum where the governments of 30 democracies work
together to address the economic, social an d environmental challenges of globalisation.
The OECD is also at the forefront of effo rts to understand and to help governments
respond to new developments and concer ns, such as corporate governance, the
information economy and the challenges of  an ageing population. The Organisation
provides a setting where governments can co mpare policy experiences, seek answers to
common problems, identify good practice and work to co-ordinate domestic and
international policies.
The OECD member countries are: Austra lia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republ ic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,
the United Kingdom and the United States. The Commission of the European
Communities takes part in the work of the OECD.
OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation’s statistics
gathering and research on ec onomic, social and environmental issues, as well as the
conventions, guidelines and st andards agreed by its members.

It has been long understood that the generati on, exploitation and diffusion of knowledge
are fundamental to economic growth, developm ent and the well being of nations. Central
to this is the need for better measures of in novation. Over time the nature and landscape
of innovation have changed, and so has the need for indicators to capture those changes
and provide policy makers with appropriate tools of analysis. A considerable body of work
was undertaken during the 1980s and 1990s to develop models and analytical
frameworks for the study of innovation. Experimentation with early surveys and theirresults, along with the need for a coherent set of concepts and tools led to the first edition
of the Oslo Manual in 1992, which focused on technological product and process (TPP)
innovation in manufacturing. This became the reference for various large scale surveys
examining the nature and impacts of innovati on in the business sector, such as the
European Community Innovation Survey (CIS), currently in its fourth round. Results from
such surveys have driven further refinement s in the Oslo Manual framework in terms of
concepts, definitions and methodology leading to a second edition published in 1997 which,
among other things, expanded coverage to service sectors.
Since then, the analysis of results from  surveys and changing policy needs led to
the launching of another revi sion of the manual, the result of which can be found in
this third edition. As there has been a growing sense that much of innovation in service
sectors is not adequately captured by the TPP concept, it was decided to address the
question of non technological innovation in this revision. As a result, the scope of what
is considered an innovation has now been expanded to include two new types:marketing and organisational innovation. These are certainly new concepts, but they
have already been tested in several OECD countries, with promising results.
New to this edition is also an effort to address the systemic dimension of
innovation, through a chapter focusing on  innovation linkages. Lessons drawn from
results of previous surveys have also been incorporated in order to refine existingconcepts and methodological issues, such as the measurement of innovation inputs
and outcomes, as well as the improvement of data collection methods.
Innovation also occurs outside the OECD  region: a growing number of countries
in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa have begun undertaking surveysbased on the Oslo Manual. Although the d esign of those surveys was usually intended
to comply with such standards, many of them have adapted the Oslo methodology totake into account specific user needs and the characteristics of statistical systems inthese countries with different economic and social backgrounds. National adaptations
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20054were developed by each country and followed different approaches. For example, it is
widely accepted that diffusion and incremental changes to innovation account for
much of the innovation occurring in non OECD countries. Using these rich and diverse
experiences, an annex has been added to this  edition of the Oslo Manual that draws on
some of the lessons learned, and provid es further guidance fo r future innovation
surveys in non OECD countries.
The Oslo Manual, developed jointly by Eurostat and the OECD, is part of a
continuously evolving family of manuals devoted to the measurement andinterpretation of data relating to science,  technology and innovation. This includes
manuals, guidelines and ha ndbooks covering R&D (Frascati Manual), globalisation
indicators, patents, the information soci ety, human resources in S&T (Canberra
Manual), and biotechnology statistics.
Prepared under the joint aegis of the OECD and the European Commission
(Eurostat), this third edition of the Oslo Manual is the result of a three yearcollaborative process that has involved th e OECD Working Party of National Experts
on Science and Technology Indicators (N ESTI) and the Eurostat Working Party on
Science, Technology and Innovation Statistics (WPSTI) as well as a number of outsideexperts. This manual provides guidelines for collecting and interpreting innovation
data in an internationally comparable manner. Finding consensus has sometimes
meant reaching compromises and agreeing  to conventions. As with other such
guidelines, there are known limitations,  but each edition of the Oslo Manual
constitutes a step forward in our understand ing of the innovation process. While this
ongoing, incremental learning incorporates the lessons of earlier studies, the Manual is
also an ambitious tool in which experimentation and testing are used to challenge the
boundaries of what is understood by innovation.
Many should be thanked for their valuable contributions. A special
acknowledgement goes to experts from Can ada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom who led the work of six focus groups which
examined a variety of topics and expressed valuable recommendations for the revision. Thedrafting of the revised Oslo Manual was unde rtaken by Dr. Peter Mortensen and Dr. Carter
Bloch from the Danish Centre for Studies in Research and Research Policy, under the
guidance of the OECD and Eurostat. The annex on innovation surveys in developing
countries was drafted by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, based on a proposal and
draft paper by the Red Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología
(RICYT) and following a broad process of co nsultation with many national experts.

Objectives and Scope of the Manual
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005101. Introduction
1. It is widely accepted that innovati on is central to the growth of output
and productivity. However, while our understanding of innovation activitiesand their economic impact has greatly in creased since the first edition of the
Manual, it is still deficient. For example, as the world economy evolves, so
does the process of innovation. Globalis ation has led to dramatic increases in
access to information and new markets for firms. It has also resulted in
greater international competition and in new organisational forms in order to
manage global supply chains. Owing to advances in technologies and greater
flows of information, knowledge is more and more viewed as a central driver
of economic growth and innovation. Yet, we do not fully understand how
these factors affect innovation.
2. In order to develop policies that support innovation appropriately, it is
necessary to better understand several critical aspects of the innovation
process, such as innovation  activities other than R&D, the interactions among
actors and the relevant knowledge flows. Policy development also requires
further advances in the analysis of  innovation, which in turn requires
obtaining better information.
3. The first edition of the Manual, issued in 1992, and the surveys
undertaken using it, including the Community Innovation Survey (CIS)
organised by the EU and comparable surveys in Australia and Canada, showedthat it is possible to develop and collect data on the complex and
differentiated process of innovation.
4. The second edition, issued in 1997, updated the framework of
concepts, definitions and methodology to incorporate survey experience and
greater understanding of the innovation  process and to cover a wider range of
industries. It improved the guidelin es for developing internationally
comparable innovation indicators fo r OECD countries and discussed the
analytical and policy problems for which the indicators have relevance.
5. Both the first and second editions used the technological product and
process (TPP) definition of innovation. This reflected a focus on firms’
technological development of new products and new production techniques
and their diffusion to other firms. Discus sion of organisational innovation and
non-technological innovation was included in an annex.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005116. Since 1992, the number of countr ies conducting innovation surveys
has grown dramatically: EU countries, other OECD countries such as Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and a large number of non-OECD
economies, among them several Latin American countries, Russia and South
Africa.
7. This third edition of the Manual draws on the large amount of data and
experience resulting from these surveys. It expands the innovationmeasurement framework in three import ant ways. First, it places greater
emphasis on the role of linkages with other firms and institutions in the
innovation process. Second, it recognises the importance of innovation in lessR&D-intensive industries, such as services and low-technology
manufacturing. This edition modifies certain aspects of the framework (such
as definitions and relevant activities) to better accommodate the servicessector. Third, the definition of innovation is expanded to include two
additional types of innovations, orga nisational innovation and marketing
innovation. Also new to the Manual is an annex on innovation surveys in non-OECD countries and reflects the fact that a growing number of them now
conduct innovation surveys.
8. Evaluation of linkages is expa nded because of the importance of
knowledge flows among firms and othe r organisations for the development
and diffusion of innovations. This helps to highlight the role of organisational
structures and practices that promote the sharing and use of knowledge andinteraction with other firms and public research institutions. These also
include the forming of closer relati onships with suppliers and ongoing
development of marketing practices to better reach customers. Linkages arenow addressed in a separate chapter covering a variety of interactions ranging
from arm’s-length exchanges of information to active involvement in joint
innovation projects.
9. While the second edition of the Manual covered services, it primarily
focused on manufacturing industries. However, innovation in services-
oriented sectors can differ substantially from innovation in manymanufacturing-oriented sectors. It is  often less formally organised, more
incremental in nature and less tech nological. In order to establish a
framework that better accommodates th is broad range of industries, this
edition modifies a number of definitions, terms and concepts.
10. To identify the full range of ch anges that firms make to improve
performance and their success in impr oving economic outcomes requires a
broader framework than technological product and process innovation. The
inclusion of marketing and organisational innovations creates a more
complete framework, one that is better able to capture the changes that affect
firm performance and contribute to  the accumulation of knowledge.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051211. The role of organisational innova tion is emphasised by Lam (2005):
“Economists assume that organisational change is a response to technical
change, when in fact organisational  innovation could be a necessary
precondition for technical innovation.”  Organisational innovations are not
only a supporting factor for product and process innovations; they can also
have an important impact on firm performance on their own. Organisational
innovations can improve the quality and efficiency of work, enhance theexchange of information, and improve firms’ ability to learn and utilise new
knowledge and technologies.
12. Firms may also allocate large amou nts of resources to market research
and the development of new marketing practices, such as targeting new
markets or market segments and developing new ways of promoting products.
New marketing practices can play a central role in firms’ performance.Marketing practices are also importan t for the success of new products, and
market research and contacts with customers can play a crucial role in
product and process development through demand-led innovation. Theinclusion of organisational and market ing innovation also allows for more
extensive analysis of the interactions between different types of innovations,
in particular the importance of implem enting organisational changes in order
to benefit from other types of innovations.
13. Organisational innovations were disc ussed in the second edition of the
Manual, and there is now some practical experience with collection of data on
organisational changes. This experi ence includes specialised surveys on
organisational innovation (Wengel et al. , 2000)and its inclusion in innovation
surveys ( e.g. Australian Innovation Survey 2003) or questions on
organisational changes (the CIS3 survey, the Japanese National Innovation
Survey 2003, among others). This type  of data has also been used in
empirical analysis, for example of the relationship between organisationalinnovation, ICT investment and productivity ( e.g.Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000;
OECD, 2004).
14. Marketing innovations are new to the Manual. While there is less
experience with marketing innovations than with organisational innovations,
questions on marketing changes have been included in a number of
innovation surveys,
1 and there has been substantial field testing of marketing
concepts in a number of countries.
15. To achieve a full picture of innovation activities, it is necessary to
include marketing methods in the framework. There are at least two reasons
for including these as a separate catego ry, as opposed to integrating them with
organisational or process innovations. First, marketing innovations can be
important for firm performance and the overall innovation process.Identifying marketing innovations allows for the analysis of their impact and
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200513their interaction with other types of innovations. Second, a defining
characteristic of marketing innovations is the orientation towards customers
and markets, with a view to improving sales and market share. These
economic objectives may differ greatl y from those of process innovations,
which tend to focus on productive qual ity and efficiency. Grouping marketing
innovations with organisational inno vations would also be problematic
because some marketing practices do no t fit into concepts of organisational
changes and because this would greatly dilute data on organisational
innovations, making it diffic ult to interpret the results.
16. The Manual’s definitions and concepts have therefore been
adapted, based on survey experience in Australia and other countries, to
include organisational an d marketing innovations in innovation surveys.
The definitions of these types of innovations are still under development
and are less well established than th e definitions of product and process
innovation.
17. The goals and scope of innovation surveys can differ in terms of the
aspects of innovation to be covered and the level of detail. Furthermore, in
expanding coverage from product and process innovation to include
marketing and organisational innovation, surveys can take one of a number ofapproaches. For example, they can pr ovide equal coverage of all types of
innovation and cover marketing and organisational innovation to some
extent, while still maintaining product and process innovations as the coreinnovation types, or they can focu s exclusively on product and process
innovation. The Manual provides guidelines that can be of use for all types of
approaches. In addition, one or more types of innovations can be covered ingreater detail through specialised surveys.
18. The addition of organisational an d marketing innovations, along with
the use of a broad definition of innova tion that includes activities to both
develop and adopt innovations, means that an increasing percentage of firms
is likely to meet the basic requiremen ts for being “innovative”. Methods are
therefore needed for identifying differen t types of innovative firms, based on
the types of innovations that they have implemented and on their innovative
capabilities and activities. It is no t enough to know whether firms are
innovative or not; it is necessary to know how firms innovate and what typesof innovations they implement.
19. With these points in mind, the aim of the present chapter is to give an
overview of the coverage and contents of the Manual (see Box 1.1).
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005142. Factors influencing the scope of the Manual
20. The aim of the Manual is to provid e guidelines for the collection and
interpretation of data on innovation. In novation data can have many uses and
the Manual is designed to accommodate these various uses. One reason for
collecting innovation data is to better understand innovation and its relation
to economic growth. This requires both knowledge of innovation activitiesthat have a direct impact on firm pe rformance (for example through greater
demand or reduced costs), and of the factors that affect their ability to
innovate. Another purpose is to provide indicators for benchmarking nationalperformance. This both informs policy making and allows for international
comparison. There is a need to collect new indicators but also a desire to
maintain existing indicators for co mparisons over time. The Manual is
designed to achieve a balance between these different needs.
21. How can one decide on the appropri ate scope, structure, terminology,
etc., for internationally comparable da ta collection? The variety of subjects
covered by both specialised and general innovation surveys is evidence thatBox 1.1. Structure of the Manual
The Manual starts with a general discussion of points that are likely to have
some effect on the choice of indicators (Chapter 2):
●An adequate conceptual understanding of the structure andcharacteristics of the innovation process and its implications forpolicymaking.
●The key unresolved problems which further data could clarify.
It continues with a framework for innovation surveys:
●Basic definitions of innovation, innovation activities and the innovative
firm (Chapter 3).
●Institutional classifications (Chapter 4).
After that, suggestions and recommenda tions are made as to the types of
issues to be covered in national and international innovation surveys:
●Measuring linkages in the innovation process; types of knowledge andtheir sources (Chapter 5).
●Innovation activities and their measurement (Chapter 6).
●Objectives, barriers and impacts of innovation (Chapter 7).
The Manual also contains two annexes:
●Innovation surveys in developing economies (Annex A).
●A detailed list of innovation examples (Annex B).
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200515many types of data are potentially availa ble. Obviously, a survey covering all
possible topics would be excessiv ely cumbersome. Priorities must be
identified, and topics, industries and survey approaches on which to
concentrate must be chosen. There are two main issues: what is measurable
and what is it of value to measure?
2.1. What is measurable?
22. Innovation is a continuous process. Firms constantly make changes toproducts and processes and collect new knowledge, and it is more difficult to
measure a dynamic process than a static activity. With the objective of
capturing this process, the Manual pres ents guidelines for collecting data on
the general process of innovation (f or example, innovation activities,
expenditures and linkages), the implemen tation of significant changes in the
firm ( i.e.innovations), the factors that influe nce innovation activities, and the
outcomes of innovation.
2.2. What is it of value to measure?
23. In constructing innovation indica tors, the information needs of policy
makers and analysts are a paramount consideration. Chapter 2 reviews these
needs, which are part of the broad in formation system that helps to reduce
uncertainty in policy making and which have been influenced, since the first
edition of the Manual, by developments in the economics of innovation.
24. Innovation policy has developed as an amalgam of science and
technology policy and industrial policy. It takes as a given that knowledge in
all its forms plays a crucial role in economic progress, and that innovation is a
complex and systemic phenomenon. Syst ems approaches to innovation shift
the focus of policy towards an emphasis on the interplay of institutions and
the interactive processes at work in the creation of knowledge and in its
diffusion and application. The term “national innovation system” has been
coined to represent this set of instit utions and these knowledge flows. This
theoretical perspective influences the choice of questions to include in an
innovation survey, and the need, for example, of extensive coverage oflinkages and knowledge sources.
25. Systems approaches complement  theories that focus on the
innovative firm, the reasons for innovating and the activities undertaken byfirms. The forces that drive innovati on at the level of the firm and the
innovations that succeed in improvin g firm performance are of central
importance for policy making. Questions on the implementation ofinnovations, the interaction of differe nt types of innovations, and on the
objectives and barriers to innovation are the source of relevant data.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005163. Scope of the Manual
26. For reasons summarised below:
●The Manual covers innovation in th e business enterprise sector only.
●It deals with innovation at the level of the firm.
●I t  c o v e r s  f o u r  t y p e s  o f  i n n o v a t i o n s :  product, process, organisational and
marketing.
●It covers diffusion up to “new to the firm”.
3.1. Sector coverage
27. Innovation can occur in any sector of the economy, including
government services such as health or  education. The Manual’s guidelines,
however, are essentially designed to deal with innovations in the businessenterprise sector alone. This includes manufacturing, primary industries and
the services sector.
28. Innovation is also important for the public sector. However, less is
known about innovation processes in  non-market-oriented sectors. Much
work remains to be done to study innovation and develop a framework for the
collection of innovation da ta in the public sector.
2 Such work could form the
basis for a separate manual.
3.2. Innovation at the level of the firm
29. The Manual is concerned with the co llection of innovation data at the
level of the firm. It does not cover industry- or economy-wide changes such as
the emergence of a new market, the development of a new source of rawmaterials or semi-manufactured goods, or  the reorganisation of an industry.
Nonetheless, it is possible in some cases to estimate industry- or economy-
wide changes, such as the emerge nce of a new market or industry
reorganisation, by aggregating data for individual firms.
30. The first three chapters of the Manual use the generic term “firm”. The
term is given a specific statistical definition in Chapter 4, which deals withclassifications. The precise definition used in a study or survey can affect the
results, as the subsidiaries of multinational corporations may be organised in
different ways, or a multinational may introduce a given innovation countryby country, market by market, or simultaneously throughout the group.
3.3. T ypes of innovations
31. A firm can make many types of chan ges in its methods of work, its use
of factors of production and the types of output that improve its productivity
and/or commercial performance. Th e Manual defines four types of
innovations that encompass a wide range of changes in firms’ activities:
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200517product innovations, process innovations, organisational innovations and
marketing innovations.
32. Full definitions of the four ty pes of innovations can be found in
Chapter 3. Product innovations involve significant changes in the capabilitiesof goods or services. Both entirely new goods and services and significant
improvements to existing products  are included. Process innovations
represent significant changes in production and delivery methods.
33. Organisational innovations refer to the implementation of new
organisational methods. These can be  changes in business practices, in
workplace organisation or in the firm’s external relations. Marketinginnovations involve the implementation of new marketing methods. These
can include changes in product design and packaging, in product promotion
and placement, and in methods for pricing goods and services.
34. An important concern wh en expanding the definition of innovation is
to maintain continuity with the earlier definition of technological product and
process (TPP) innovation.
3 However, the decision to include the services sector
requires a few minor modifications in the definitions of product and process
innovation to reflect innovation acti vities in the services sector more
adequately and to reduce the manu facturing orientation. The revised
definitions (see Chapter 3) remain very comparable to the earlier (TPP) ones.
35. One change is the removal of th e word “technological” from the
definitions, as the word raises a concern that man y services sector firmswould interpret “technological” to mean “using high-technology plant and
equipment”, and thus not applicable to  many of their product and process
innovations.
3.4. Diffusion and the degree of novelty
36. The Manual deals with changes that involve a significant degree ofnovelty for the firm. It excludes changes that are minor or lack a sufficient
degree of novelty. However, an innovati on does not need to be developed by
the firm itself but can be acquired from other firms or institutions through theprocess of diffusion.
37. Diffusion is the way in which in novations spread, through market or
non-market channels, from their very  first implementation to different
consumers, countries, regi ons, sectors, ma rkets and firms. Without diffusion,
an innovation has no economic impact. The minimum requirement for a
change in a firm’s products or functions to be considered an innovation is thatit is new (or significantly improved) to  the firm. Three other concepts for the
novelty of innovations are discussed in Chapter 3: new to the market, new to
the world and disruptive innovations.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051838. There are two main reasons for using “new to the firm” as the
minimum requirement of an innovation. First, adoption of innovations is
important for the innovation system as a whole. It involves a flow of
knowledge to adopting firms. Furthermore, the learning process in adoptingan innovation can lead to subsequent improvements in the innovation and to
the development of new products, proc esses and other innovations. Second,
the main impact of innovation on econ omic activity stems from the diffusion
of initial innovations to other firms. Diffusion is captured by covering
innovations that are new to the firm.
39. Of note, the Manual does not cover the diffusion of a new technology
to other divisions or parts of a firm after its initial adoption or
commercialisation.
4 For example, the first impl ementation of new production
technology in one of five factories owned by the same firm is counted asinnovation, but implementation of the same technology in the remaining four
factories is not.
4. Providing data on the key issues
4.1. Innovation activities and expenditures
40. Innovation activities includ e all scientific, technological,
organisational, financial and commercial steps which actually lead, or are
intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some of theseactivities may be innovative in their own right, while others are not novel but
are necessary to implementation.
41. Innovation comprises a number of activities that are not included in
R&D, such as later phases of development for preproduction, production and
distribution, development activities with a lesser degree of novelty, support
activities such as training and market preparation, and development andimplementation activities for innovati ons such as new marketing methods or
new organisational methods which are not product and process innovations.
Innovation activities may also include acquisition of external knowledge orcapital goods that is not part of R&D. A detailed breakdown of innovation
activities and their descriptions, al ong with measurement issues, can be
found in Chapter 6.
42. During a given period, a firm’s innovation activities may be of three
kinds:
●Successful  in having resulted in the implementation of a new innovation
(though not necessarily commercially successful).
●Ongoing , work in progress, which has not yet resulted in the implementation
of an innovation.
●Abandoned  before the implementation of an innovation.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051943. Expenditures are measured on the basis of the sum of these three
kinds of activity over a given period of time (see Chapter 6). An alternative
would be to collect information on total expenditures on activities related to
individual innovations. Firms have found it  difficult to report a full set of data
whichever approach is used, yet this is an essential data set for economic and
policy analysis purposes. It is hoped that, with successive exercises, firms will
find it in their own interest to cost their innovation activities.
4.2. Factors influencing innovation
44. Enterprises can engage in innovation for a number of reasons. Theirobjectives may involve products, markets, efficiency, quality or the ability tolearn and to implement changes. Id entifying enterprises’ motives for
innovating and their importance is of he lp in examining the forces that drive
innovation activities, such as competition and opportunities for entering newmarkets.
45. Innovation activities can be hamper ed by a number of factors. There
may be reasons for not starting innovati on activities at all, or there may be
factors that slow such activities or affect them negatively. These include
economic factors, such as high costs or  lack of demand, factors specific to an
enterprise, such as lack of skilled pe rsonnel or knowledge, and legal factors,
such as regulations or tax rules.
46. The ability of enterprises to appropriate the gains from their
innovation activities also affects innovation. If, for example, enterprises are
unable to protect their innovations from imitation by competitors, they will
have less incentive to innovate. On the other hand, if an industry functionswell without formal protection, promot ing such protection can slow the flow
of knowledge and technology and lead to higher prices for goods and services.
4.3. The innovating firm and the impact of innovation
47. The innovative firm (defined in Chapter 3) is one that has introduced
an innovation during the period under review. Such innovations need not have
been a commercial success: many innovations fail. Innovative firms can bedivided into those that have mainly developed innovations on their own or in
co-operation with other firms or public  research organisations, and those that
have mainly innovated by adopting innovations (for example new equipment)developed by other firms. Innovative firms can also be distinguished by the
types of innovations they have implemented; they may have implemented a
new product or process, or they ma y have implemented a new marketing
method or organisational change.
48. Impacts of innovations on firm performance range from effects on
sales and market share to changes in productivity and efficiency. Important
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200520impacts at industry and national le vels are changes in international
competitiveness and in total factor productivity, knowledge spillovers from
firm-level innovations, and an increase  in the amount of knowledge flowing
through networks.
49. The outcomes of product innovations can be measured by the
percentage of sales derived from new or improved products (see Chapter 7).
Similar approaches can be used to me asure the outcomes of other types of
innovations. Additional indicators of the outcomes of innovation can be
obtained through qualitative questi ons on the effects of innovations.
4.4. Linkages in the innovation process
50. The innovative activities of a firm  partly depend on the variety and
structure of its links to sources of information, knowledge, technologies,
practices and human and financial resources. Each linkage connects theinnovating firm to other actors in the innovation system: government
laboratories, universities, policy de partments, regulators, competitors,
suppliers and customers. Innovation surveys can obtain information on the
prevalence and importance of different types of linkages, and on the factors
that influence the use of specific linkages.
51. Three types of external linkages are identified. Open information sources
provide openly available information that does not require the purchase of
technology or intellectual property rights, or interaction with the source.
Acquisition of knowledge and technology  results from purchases of external
knowledge and capital goods (machinery , equipment, software) and services
embodied with new knowledge or technology that do not involve interactionwith the source. Innovation co-operation  requires active co-operation with other
firms or public research institutions on innovation activities (and may include
purchases of knowledge and technology).
5. Some survey issues
5.1. Approach to data collection
5.2.1. Choice of the survey approach
52. There are two main approaches to collecting data on innovations:
i)The “subject” approach starts from the innovative behaviour and
activities of the firm as a whole. The idea is to explore the factors
influencing the innovative behaviour of the firm (strategies, incentives
and barriers to innovation) and the scope of various innovation
activities, and above all to examine the outputs and effects of
innovation. These surveys are design ed to be representative of all
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200521industries so that the results can be grossed up and comparisons made
between industries.
ii)The “object” approach involves the collection of data about specific
innovations (usually a “significant in novation” of some kind or a firm’s
main innovation). The approach involves collecting some descriptive,
quantitative and qualitative data abou t the particular innovation at the
same time that data is sought about the firm.
53. From the point of view of current economic development, it is the
differential success of firms that shap es economic outcomes and is of policy
significance. This favours a subject- based approach, although innovation
surveys can combine both approaches by including general questions on the
firm and specific questions on a single innovation. It is the subject, the firm,
that is important, and this is the appr oach has been chosen as the basis for
these guidelines.
5.2.2. Survey methods
54. To achieve international comparability of subject-based innovationsurveys, it is important to harmonise survey methods. Guidelines are given in
Chapter 8.
55. The target population for innovation  surveys concerns statistical units
(innovators and non-innovators, R&D performers and non-R&D performers) in
the business enterprise sector, includ ing both goods-producing and services
sectors. Innovative activities take pl ace in small and medium-sized units as
well as in large units. To capture innovation activities in these smaller units,
the target population should include, at a minimum, all statistical units withat least ten employees. In the case of sample surveys, the sample frames
should correspond as closely as possible to the target population.
56. In order to ensure a satisfactory  response rate, the questionnaire
should be as short as possible and questions and instructions should be
clearly formulated. This may involve expressing the formal definitions in
Chapter 3 in ways that are appropriate and meaningful to respondents in theindustry concerned.
57. In the data collection phase, particular attention should be paid to
checking the reliability and consistency of data and to follow-up or reminderprocedures. International comparability of  the resulting data will be further
improved by adopting uniform methods of imputing missing values,
weighting factors, methods for presenting results, etc.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005226. The relationship between the  Oslo Manual  and other 
international standards and related concepts
6.1. Manuals for the measurement of science and technology activities
58. T wo basic families of S&T indicators are directly relevant to the
measurement of innovation: resources de voted to R&D and patent statistics.
In addition, bibliometrics and several other types of indicators providecomplementary information, although in formation is not always available at
the firm level.
59. R&D data are collected through national surveys according to the
guidelines laid down in the Frascati Manual  (OECD, 2002). These data have
proved valuable in many studies: for example, the effects of R&D on
productivity have been estimated by econometric techniques, at the country,
sector and firm levels. These data have two main limitations. First, R&D is an
input. Although it is obviously related to technical change, it does not measure
it. Second, R&D does not encompass all the efforts of firms and governmentsin this area, as there are other sources of technical change, such as learning by
doing, which are not covered by this narrow definition.
60. A patent is a legal property right to an invention, which is granted by
national patent offices. A patent give s its owner sole rights (for a certain
duration) to exploit the patented inventio n; at the same time it discloses the
details of the patent as a way to allow broader social use of the discovery.
Patent statistics are increasingly used in various ways as indicators of the
output of research activities. The number of patents granted to a given firm orcountry may reflect its technological dynamism; examination of the growth of
patent classes can give some indication of the direction of technological
change. The drawbacks of patents as innovation indicators are well-known.Many innovations are not patented, and some are covered by multiple patents;
many patents have no technological or economic value, and others have very
high value (see the Patent Manual , OECD, 1994).
61. These two basic families of statistics are complemented by several
others: statistics on scientific public ations (bibliometrics), publications in
trade and technical journals (“LBIO” or literature-based indicators of
innovation output), skilled human resources, the technology balance of
payments, globalisation indicators, and activity in high-technology sectors
(investment, employment, external trade). Moreover, some information oninnovation and innovative activities ca n be drawn indirectly from many other
sources, such as business surveys or education statistics.
62. The globalisation process affects innovation in a number of ways,
through increases in international competit ion, in flows of goods, services and
knowledge across national boundaries, and in international interactions.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200523Multinational enterprises (MNEs) play a key role in this process. The Handbook
on Economic Globalisation Indicators  (OECD, 2005) discusses issues relating to
globalisation and provides a set of relevant globalisation indicators.
63. Wherever possible, the Manual draws on the concepts and
classifications set out in other volume s in the set of OECD manuals for the
measurement of scientific and technological activities (see Box 1.2), especially
the Frascati Manual  on the resources devoted to R&D (OECD, 2002). This remark
applies particularly to a number of qu estions on R&D and other S&T activities
recommended for inclusion in innovation surveys in Chapter 6 and 7.
6.2. Other standards and classifications
Because of the need to place inno vation in a wider context, both
conceptually and in terms of databa ses, United Nations guidelines and
classifications are used as far as po ssible, notably the System of National
Accounts – SNA (CEC et al. , 1994) and the Internatio nal Standard Industrial
Classification – ISIC Rev. 3.1 (UN, 2002) and, as this is a joint OECD/Eurostat
Manual, the corresponding European standards, notably the StatisticalClassification of Economic Activities in the European Community –
NACE Rev. 1.1 – series 2E.

64. As noted above, there are other wa ys of examining changes in firms
that improve their productivity and performance. A few of the most relevant
intangible investments are examined: the generation and adoption of
information and communication technology (ICT), biotechnology andknowledge management.
65. Information and communication technology  covers both hardware and
software. Their development and diffusion is believed to have had a majorimpact on the pattern of production  and employment in a wide range of
industries. In the case of hardware it may be interesting not only to know
when a company first introduces a technologically new or improved piece ofICT equipment but also the proportion of ICT in its total stock of equipment,
including subsequent purchases of fu rther machines of the same model.
Mapping the development, production, ad aptation and use of software is a
more complex matter, as these activi ties are carried out throughout the
economy. Surveys have been conducte d both on uses of ICT and on R&D
activity in firms developing ICT products.
66. While less pervasive than ICT, biotechnology  is also increasingly
expected to have a large economic impact, through increasing use of
biotechnology to produce products and processes. A number of biotechnology
surveys have been conducted, primarily on developers of biotechnology.
However, some surveys have also examined biotechnology users ( e.g.Statistics
Canada, 1999).
67. Knowledge management  involves activities related to the capture, use
and sharing of knowledge by the organisation. It is an important part of theinnovation process. A number of surv eys have been conducted on knowledge
management practices in recent years.
5 They cover policies and strategies,
leadership, knowledge capture, training and communications, as well asreasons for using knowledge management practices and the reasons behind
the development of such practices. In addition, questions on knowledge
management have been included in innovation surveys.
6
68. Intangible investment  covers expenditures on non-routine marketing,
training, software and some other simi lar items, in addition to current
expenditure on R&D. It covers current expenditure on innovation but alsocomprises elements that are not part of current innovation expenditure (for
example, all of a firm’s training and marketing expenditure in general, not
simply training or marketing in co nnection with the implementation of
innovations). It does not cover tangible investment such as capital innovation
expenditure, which includes capital ex penditure on R&D, the acquisition of
other machinery and equipment related to innovations.

69. The Manual is based on a consensus of views on the demand for
innovation indicators and the underlyi ng policy needs and economic theory,
on the definitions and coverage of innova tion and on the lessons to be learned
from previous surveys. Managed jointl y by OECD and Eurostat, it has been
written for and by experts from some 30 countries that collect and analyseinnovation data. Finding consensus has sometimes meant reaching
compromises and agreeing to conventi ons. Furthermore, the complexity of
the innovation process itself makes it difficult to establish absolutely preciseguidelines. Nevertheless, the goal of the Manual is to provide a robust set of
guidelines that can be used to produce meaningful indicators of innovation.
Notes
1. Experience covers the inclusion in inno vation surveys of questions on marketing
changes (the CIS3 survey, the Japane se National Innovation Survey 2003 and
others). In addition, the Intangible Asse ts Survey 2004 in France included all four
types of innovations ( i.e.marketing, organisational, product and process) along
with a number of other questions on marketing practices. The CIS4 survey, in
progress at the time of publication of th e Manual, also included all four types of
innovations.
2. Earl (2003) is an example of early work in this area. 3. “Technological product and process (TPP) innovations comprise implemented
technologically new products and proc esses and significant technological
improvements in products and processes. A TPP innovation has been
implemented if it has been introduced on  the market (product innovation) or used
within a production process (process innovation).” (OECD/Eurostat, 1997, §130.)
4. An exception would be an establishment- level survey, which could collect data on
the first introduction of an innovation into each establishment.
5. See Foray and Gault (2003). In addition , a Eurostat pilot survey on knowledge
management will be conducted in 2006.

Innovation Theory and Measurement Needs
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005281. Introduction
71. “The knowledge-based economy” is an expression coined to describe
trends in advanced economies towards greater dependence on knowledge,information and high skill levels, and the increasing need for ready access to
all of these by the business and public sectors. Knowledge and technology
have become increasingly complex, raising the importance of links betweenfirms and other organisations as a way to acquire specialised knowledge. A
parallel economic development has been the growth of innovation in services
in advanced economies.
72. Both innovation research and policy discussions emphasise the
importance of taking a broad perspect ive on innovation. A “knowledge-based”
view focuses on the interactive processes through which knowledge is createdand exchanged both within and outside firms and other organisations. Many
knowledge-intensive industries, such as high-technology manufacturing and
business services, have grown strongly in many developed economies.Furthermore, a wide range of manufa cturing and services industries have
increased their use of knowledge-intensive technologies for production
processes and service provision. While R&D plays a vital role in the innovationprocess, much innovation activity is  not R&D-based, yet relies on highly
skilled workers, on interactions wi th other firms and public research
institutions, and on an organisational structure that is conducive to learningand exploiting knowledge.
73. The aim of this chapter is to examine theories and research on
innovation and policy issues that are influenced by these theories, and todiscuss how and to what extent innovation surveys can provide data on these
issues. Innovation theory informs the de sign both of policy and measurement,
and empirical analysis of data adds to  our understanding of innovation, policy
evaluation and the formation of new policy initiatives.
2. Economics of innovation
74. Research on innovation spans a nu mber of disciplines, with economic
approaches alone adopting several different theoretical perspectives, each of
which offers significant insights. While these can be presented as alternatives,
they can also be seen as complementary. This section evaluates the varioustheoretical approaches to innovation  and assesses their implications for
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200529policy and data collection. The goal is to ensure that the design of innovation
surveys results in obtaining data that ar e relevant for both theory and policy.
75. These theories address a number of innovation policy and
measurement issues, such as why firms i nnovate, what forces drive innovation,
and which factors hinder it. Related issues are the internal functioning of firms
and the types of business practices used to promote innovation. Another
important issue is the nature of knowledge, how it is accumulated, and how itflows between actors. A final issue is how innovation processes develop at the
industry, regional or national levels.
76. The work of Joseph Schumpeter has greatly influenced theories of
innovation. He argued that economic development is driven by innovation
through a dynamic process in which new technologies replace the old, a
process he labelled “creative destruct ion”. In Schumpeter’s view, “radical”
innovations create major disruptive changes, whereas “incremental”
innovations continuously advance the process of change. Schumpeter (1934)
proposed a list of five types of innovations:
i)Introduction of new products.
ii)Introduction of new methods of production.
iii)Opening of new markets.
iv)Development of new sources of supply for raw materials or other inputs.
v)Creation of new market structures in an industry.
77. It is crucial to know why firms innovate. The ultimate reason is to
improve firm performance, for example by increasing demand or reducing
costs. A new product or process can be a source of market advantage for the
innovator. In the case of productivity -enhancing process innovations, the firm
gains a cost advantage over its competit ors, allowing a higher mark-up at the
prevailing market price or, depending on the elasticity  of demand, the use of a
combination of lower price and higher mark-up than its competitors to gain
market share and increase profits. In the case of product innovation, the firm
can gain a competitive advantage by in troducing a new product, which allows
it to increase demand and mark-ups.
78. Firms can also increase demand through product differentiation, by
targeting new markets and by influenc ing demand for existing products.
Changes in organisational methods can improve the efficiency and quality oftheir operations, thereby increasi ng demand or reducing costs.
79. Innovation can also improve perf ormance by increasing the firm’s
ability to innovate. For example, improving the capabilities of productionprocesses can make it possible to develop a new range of products, and new
organisational practices can improve the firm’s ability to gain and create new
knowledge that can be used to develop other innovations.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20053080. A Schumpeterian perspective te nds to emphasise innovation as
market experiments and to look for large, sweeping changes that
fundamentally restructure industries and markets. Mainstream or neo-
classical economics views innovation in terms of asset creation as well asmarket experiments. In this view, innova tion is an aspect of business strategy,
or part of the set of investment deci sions to create capacity for product
development or to improve efficiency. Recent developments have centred on
the idea of “sunk costs”, irrecoverable commitments of resources to enter new
markets or to create competitive adva ntages by repositioning production or
output in the value chain (Sutton, 1992, 1998).
81. Appropriation is an important factor in innovation, given that research
results and new technologies often have aspects of a public good , as the costs
of making them available to many  users are low compared to their
development costs. Once di sseminated, users cannot be denied further access
to such an innovation. In such cases, the firm cannot capt ure all the benefits
generated by its innovation, which lessens the incentive to invest ininnovation activities. Therefore, the ability to protect innovations will have an
important influence on innovation activity.
82. Other work, notably in indust rial organisation theory ( e.g.Tirole, 1995),
has emphasised the signific ance of competitive positioning. Firms innovate to
defend their existing competitive position  as well as to seek new competitive
advantages. A firm may take a reactive approach and innovate to avoid losingmarket share to an innovative competitor. Or it may take a proactive approach
to gain a strategic market position relative to its competitors, for example by
developing and then trying to enforc e higher technical standards for the
products it produces.
83. The decision to innovate often takes place under great uncertainty
(Rosenberg, 1994). Future developments in knowledge and technology,markets, product demand and potential uses for technologies can be highly
unpredictable, although the level of uncertainty will vary by sector, the life
cycle of a product and many other factors. The adoption of new products orprocesses or the implementation of new marketing or organisational methods
are also fraught with uncertainty. Furt hermore, the search for and collection
of relevant information can be very time-consuming and costly.
84. Uncertainty can lead firms to he sitate to implement significant
changes, even as they face a volatile  environment that increases pressures to
introduce new products, seek new markets and introduce new technologies,practices and organisational method s into their production processes.
Uncertainty can also make it more difficult for firms to obtain external
funding for their innovation projects.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20053185. Literature on organisational innovation ( e.g.Lam, 2005) focuses on the
role of organisational structures, learning processes and adaptation to
changes in technology and the environment (the latter includes the
institutional framework and markets).
86. A firm’s organisational structure ca n affect the efficiency of innovation
activities, with some structures better suited to particular environments. For
example, a greater degree of organisational integration may improve the co-ordination, planning and implementation of innovation strategies.
Organisational integration can work particularly well in industries
characterised by incremental changes in knowledge and technologies. Alooser, more flexible form of organisation, which allows workers greater
autonomy to make decisions and define  their responsibilities, might be more
effective in generating more radical innovations.
87. Organisational learning depends on  practices and routines, patterns of
interaction both within and outside the firm, and the ability to mobilise
individual tacit knowledge and promote interaction. Such learning can beencouraged through careful design of practices, routines and relationships, or
through a more flexible, fluid organisation in which individuals are
encouraged to develop new ideas and ways of doing things.
88. Marketing theories ( e.g.Hunt, 1983) focus on consumer behaviour,
market exchanges between buyers and sellers, and normative approaches. As
both buyers and sellers are heterogeneou s, firms face the daunting challenge
of matching their products to demand . The heterogeneity of consumers also
means that product differentiation is often as important for capturing
demand as the development of new products. Demand may depend not onlyon the objective characteristics of products, but also on their social
characteristics and image, and firms can use these last two features to
influence demand for their products. Normative marketing theories focus on
the implementation of mark eting practices. An example is the Marketing Mix
Model ( e.g.Perreault and McCarthy, 2005) that focuses on the “4 Ps” of
marketing: product, price, promotion and placement.
89. Product  involves changes in product design and packaging that are
intended to change or enhance the product’s appeal or to target a new market
or market segment. Price  involves the use of pricing methods to market goods
or services. Promotion  involves promotional efforts made by firms to improve
their products’ image or to increase aw areness of their products. The final P,
placement , involves both the types of sales channels that firms choose to sell
their products and how these sales chan nels are designed in order to best
market their products.
90. The diffusion of new knowledge and technology is a central part of
innovation. The diffusion process often involves more than the mere adoption
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200532of knowledge and technology, as adopting firms learn from and build on new
knowledge and technology. Theories of diffusion ( e.g.Hall, 2005) focus on
factors that affect firms’ decisions to  adopt new technologies, their access to
new knowledge and their absorptive ability.
91. Sociological views on the diffusion of new technologies ( e.g.Rogers,
1995) highlight firms’ attrib utes that influence thei r decisions to adopt new
knowledge or technologies, such as the relative advantage of the newtechnology, its compatibility with ex isting ways of doing things, its
complexity, and the ease with which the firm is able to evaluate the new
technology. Economic views on diffusi on tend to focus on the costs and
benefits of adopting new technologies . These potential benefits can often be
strategic, so as to keep up with or gain an advantage over competitors.
92. Access to knowledge and technology can depend to a large extent on
the connections between firms and organisa tions. This is particularly the case
for the tacit knowledge that is held in the minds of people, or for information
that is held in the “routines” of orga nisations. Direct interaction with the
people with tacit knowledge or with acce ss to routines is required in order to
gain access to these types of knowledge.
93. Much knowledge is codified  and can be accessed and used without
direct interaction with the source. Transfers of codified knowledge comprise a
large share of technology diffusion, and efforts to promote the codification of
knowledge can have important impacts on productivity, growth andinnovation. An example is work on the establishment of technology
standards.
94. Even for information that is openly available, finding it can be a serious
challenge, in particular since searching for new information can be very costly.
Thus, ease of communication, effect ive channels of information and skills
transmission, within and between orga nisations, are very important for
diffusion.
95. Evolutionary approaches (Nelson and Winter, 1982) view innovation as
a path-dependent process whereby knowledge and technology are developedthrough interaction between various acto rs and other factors. The structure of
such interaction affects the future path  of economic change. As an example,
market demand and the opportunities for commercialisation influence whichproducts are developed and whic h technologies are successful.
96. Closely linked to the evolutionary approach is the view of innovation
as a system. The systems of innovation approach (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson,1993) studies the influence of external institutions, broadly defined, on the
innovative activities of firms and othe r actors. It emphasises the importance
of the transfer and diffusion of ideas, skills, knowledge, information andsignals of many kinds. The channe ls and networks through which this
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200533information circulates are embedded in a social, political and cultural
background that guides and constrains innovation activities and capabilities.
Innovation is viewed as a dynamic process in which knowledge is
accumulated through learning and interaction. These concepts were initiallyintroduced in terms of national systems of innovation, but they are also
applicable to regional and international systems.
97. Systems approaches to innovation shift the focus of policy towards an
emphasis on the interplay of institutions and look at interactive processes in
the creation, diffusion and applicatio n of knowledge. They emphasise the
importance of the conditions, regula tions and policies in which markets
operate and hence the role of governme nts in monitoring and seeking to fine
tune this overall framework.
3. A measurement framework
98. These different theories form the basis for the innovation
measurement framework used in the Manual. They highlight, among other
things, the driving forces behind i nnovation, the importance not only of
products and processes but also of ma rketing and organisational practices,
the role of linkages and diffusion, an d the view of innovation as a system.
99. The link between innovation and economic change is of central
interest. Through innovation, new knowledge is created and diffused,
expanding the economy’s potential to develop new products and more
productive methods of operation. Such improvements depend not only ontechnological knowledge, but also on other forms of knowledge that are used
to develop product, process, market ing and organisational innovations.
Specific types of innovation can differ greatly in their impact on firmperformance and on economic change. For this reason, it is important to be
able to identify the implementation and impacts of different types of
innovation.
100. Figure 2.1 depicts this framework from the perspective of the firm, the
target of innovation surveys. Other models of the innovation process, such as
Kline and Rosenberg’s chain-link mode l (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986) or the
innovation dynamo (OECD/Eurostat, 1997), provide a useful theoretical
overview for innovation processes but are less adapted to guiding survey
design. The framework used in the Manu al thus represents an integration of
insights from various firm-based theories of innovation with those of
approaches that view innovation as a system. The main characteristics of the
framework described are:
●Innovation in the firm.
●Linkages with other firms and public research institutions.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200534●The institutional framework in which firms operate.
●The role of demand.
101. Innovation in firms refers to planne d changes in a firm’s activities with
a view to improving the firm’s performance. Drawing on the discussion of
innovation theory above, the concept of  innovation used in the Manual refers
to changes characterised by the following features:
a)Innovation is associated with uncertainty  over the outcome of innovation
activities. It is not known beforehand what the result of the innovation
activities will be, e.g.whether R&D will result in the successful development
of a marketable product or how much time and resources will be needed to
implement a new production process, marketing or orga nisational method
and how successful they will be.Figure 2.1. The innovation measurement framework

OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200535b)Innovation involves investment . Relevant investment can include
acquisition of fixed and intangible assets  as well as other activities (such as
salaries, or purchase of material or services) that may yield potential
returns in the future.
c)Innovation is subject to spillovers . The benefits of creative innovation are
rarely fully appropriated by the inventing firm. Firms that innovate by
adopting the innovation can benefit from knowledge spillovers or from theuse of the original innovation. For so me innovation activities, imitation
costs are substantially lower than deve lopment costs, so that an effective
appropriation mechanism to provide an incentive to innovate may berequired.
d)Innovation involves the utilisation of new knowledge  or a new use or
combination of existing knowledge . New knowledge may either be generated by
the innovating firm in the course  of its innovation activities ( i.e.through
intramural R&D) or acquired externally through various channels
(e.g.purchase of new technology). The use of new knowledge or the
combination of existing knowledge requires innovative efforts that can be
distinguished from standardised routines.
e)Innovation aims at improving a firm’s performance by gaining a competitive
advantage (or simply maintaining competitiv eness) by shifting the demand
curve of the firm’s products ( e.g.increasing product quality, offering new
products or opening up ne w markets or groups of cu stomers) or a firm’s cost
curve ( e.g.reducing unit costs of producti on, purchasing, distribution or
transaction), or by improving the firm’s ability to innovate ( e.g.increasing
the ability to develop new products or processes or to gain and create newknowledge).
102. There are two main options open to  a firm that wants to change its
products, capabilities or production, ma rketing and organisational systems. It
can invest in creative activities to develop innovations in house, either alone
or in conjunction with external partners, or it can adopt innovations
developed by other firms or institutions as part of a diffusion process. These
two options offer countless combinat ions, as when a firm adopts an
organisational innovation developed by another firm and adjusts it to function
with its own work routines, or when it adapts new manufacturing technologyto its production line, or when it introduces a new component obtained from
a supplier into a consumer product. Both the creation and adoption of
innovations can involve either intensive learning and interaction with otheractors, or minimal external linkages.
103. The specific innovation activities  that firms can use to develop or
acquire innovations include R&D and/or many other activities that aresummarised below.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200536●R&D: R&D is defined in the Frascati Manual  (OECD, 2002) and includes the
following:
i)The firm can engage in basic and applied research to acquire new
knowledge and direct research towards specific inventions ormodifications of existing techniques.
ii)It can develop new product or process concepts or other new methods
to assess whether they are feasible and viable, a stage which mayinvolve: a) development and testing; and b) further research to modify
designs or technical functions.
●Other innovative activity: The firm can engage in many non-R&D activities
that can be part of innovation. These activities can strengthen capabilities
that enable the development of innovations or the ability to successfully
adopt innovations developed by other firms or institutions:
iii)It can identify new concepts for products, processes, marketing
methods or organisational changes: a)via its marketing side and
relations with users; b)via the identification of opportunities for
commercialisation resulting from its own or others’ basic or strategic
research; c)via its design and development capabilities; d)by
monitoring competitors; and e)by using consultants.
iv)It can buy technical information, paying fees or royalties for patented
inventions (which usually require research and development work to
adapt and modify the invention to its own needs), or buy know-howand skills through engineering, desi gn or other consultancy services.
v)Human skills can be developed (through internal training) or purchased
(by hiring); tacit and informal learni ng – “learning by doing” – may also
be involved.
vi) It can invest in equipment, software or intermediate inputs that
embody the innovative work of others.
vii)It can reorganise management system s and its overall business activities.
viii)It can develop new methods of ma rketing and selling its goods and
services.
104. All these innovation activities have as their end objective the
improvement of the firm’s performance. They can be intended to develop and
implement new products and processe s, new methods of promoting and
selling the firm’s products and/or changes in the firm’s organisational
practices and structure.

parameters within which firms operat e. The component elements include: 
●The basic educational  system for the general population , which determines
minimum educational st andards in the workfo rce and the domestic
consumer market.
●The university system .
●The specialised  technical training  system .
●The science and research  base .
●Common pools of codified knowledge , such as publications, technical,
environmental and ma nagement standards.
●Innovation policies  and other government policies that influence innovation by firms.
●Legislative  and macroeconomic settings  such as patent law, taxation, corporate
governance rules and policies relating  to interest and exchange rates,
tariffs, and competition.
●The communications  infrastructure , including roads and telecommunication networks.
●Financial  institutions  which determine, for example, the ease of access to
venture capital.
●Market  accessibility , including possibilities for the establishment of close
relations with customers as well as ma tters such as size and ease of access.
●Industry structure  and the competitive environment , including the existence of
supplier firms in complementary sectors.
4. Sectoral and regional aspects of innovation
106. Innovation processes differ greatly from sector to sector in terms of
development, rate of technological change, linkages and access to knowledge, as
well as in terms of organisational structures and institutional factors
(e.g.Malerba, 2005). Some sectors are charac terised by rapid change and radical
innovations, others by smaller, incremental changes.
107. In high-technology se ctors, R&D plays a central role in innovation
activities, while other sectors rely to  a greater degree on the adoption of
knowledge and technology. Differences in innovation activity across sectors
(e.g.whether mainly incrementa l or radical innovations) also place different
demands on the organisational structure of firms, and instit utional factors such
as regulations and intellectual property ri ghts can vary greatly in their role and
importance. It is important to take these differences into account when designingpolicy. They are also important for measurement, both when collecting data that
allow for analysis across sectors and regions and when ensuring that the
measurement framework is applicable to a broad range of industries.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005384.1. Innovation in services
108. The importance of innovation in th e services sector and of the services
sector’s contribution to economic grow th is increasingly recognised and has
led to a number of studies on innovation in services (de Jong et al ., 2003;
Hauknes, 1998; Howells and Tether, 2004; also Miles, 2005).
109. The services sector is diverse.  Howells and Tether (2004) classify
services into four groups: services dealing mainly with goods (such as
transport and logistics), those dealing with information (such as call centres),knowledge-based services, and services dealing with people (such as health
care). While this diversity should be kept in mind, several general
characteristics apply to most services.
110. A key element of services is the distinction between products and
processes is often blurred, with production and consumption occurring
simultaneously. Development of processe s can be more informal for services
than for goods, with an initial phase co nsisting of search, idea gathering and
commercial evaluation, foll owed by implementation.
111. Innovation activity in services al so tends to be a continuous process,
consisting of a series of incremental changes in products and processes. This
may occasionally complicate the identification of innovations in services in
terms of single events, i.e.as the implementation of  a significant change in
products, processes or other methods.
4.2. Innovation in low- and medium-technology industries
112. Innovation in low- and medium-t echnology industries (LMTs) often
receives less attention than innovation in high-technology industries. However,
innovation in LMTs can have a substantial impact on economic growth, owing tothe weight of these sectors in the economy.
113. LMTs are generally characterised by incremental innovation and
adoption. As such, innovation activities are often focused on productionefficiency, product differentiation an d marketing (Von Tunzelmann and Acha,
2005). An important aspect of innovation in these industries is the fact that it is
more complex than the simple adoption of new technologies. In many cases,innovation activities in LMTs involv e the incorporation of high-technology
products and technologies. Prominent examples are the use of ICT and
biotechnology ( e.g.in food processing) in the de velopment of new products and
production processes. LMTs  use and application of ad vanced technologies can
place new demands on the skills of th eir workforce and can affect their
organisational structure and their interactions with other firms and publicresearch institutions.

 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005394.3. Innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises
114. Small and medium-sized enterpri ses (SMEs) are of necessity more
specialised in their activities. This increases the importance of efficient
interaction with other firms and public re search institutions for R&D, exchange of
knowledge and, potentially, for commercialisation and marketing activities.
115. Finance can be a determining factor for innovation in SMEs, which often
lack internal funds to conduct innovation  projects and have much more difficulty
obtaining external funding than larger firms. Surveys can provide data on thedegree to which financial constraints affect the ability of SMEs to innovate.
4.4. Regional innovation
116. The notion that region al factors can influence the innovative capacity
of firms has led to increasing interest in analysing innovation at the regional
level. Regional differences in levels of innovation activity can be substantial,and identifying the main characteristics and factors that promote innovation
activity and the development of specific sectors at regional level can help in
understanding innovation processes and be valuable for the elaboration ofpolicy.
117. As a parallel to national innova tion systems, regional innovation
systems may develop. The presence, for example, of local public researchinstitutions, large dynamic firms, indu stry clusters, venture capital and a
strong entrepreneurial environment can influence the innovative
performance of regions. These create th e potential for contacts with suppliers,
customers, competitors and public rese arch institutions. Infrastructure also
plays an important role.
4.5. Globalisation
118. National systems of innovation bu ild on the idea that many of the
factors that influence innovation activiti es are national, such as institutional
factors, culture and values. At the same time, it is also clear that innovation
processes are, in many ways, international. Technology and knowledge flow
across borders. Firms interact with  foreign firms and universities. Many
markets, in terms of firms and their co mpetitors, are global. The Internet has
greatly enhanced opportunities for communicating and doing business with
firms in other countries.
119. Multinational enterprises are a cent ral factor in globalisation. Their
activities transcend national boundaries as they involve international
transfers of capital, knowledge and technology.
120. The globalisation process is also a powerful driving force for
innovation. International competition forces firms to increase their efficiency
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200540and develop new products. Globalisation can also change the industrial
structure of economies, pushing them to develop new industries and adapt
their institutional frameworks.
5. Areas for investigation
121. It is essential to feed the policy debate with relevant information and
analysis of many aspects of innovation. Ideally, a comprehensive information
system should be constructed that co vers all types of factors relevant to
innovation policy and research. It would place governments in a strongposition to deal appropriately with spec ific policy issues that may arise. In
practice, only parts of such a system ca n be covered by indicators, while other
parts call for qualitative information. Moreover, as policy and indicatoranalysts are well aware, indicators only occasionally relate neatly to a single
factor or issue; more often than not they relate to a range of matters and only
partially to each. Any broad information or monitoring system will need to besupplemented with case studies or specialised surveys when specific, in-
depth analysis is required.
5.1. What can be measured?
122. Innovation surveys can provide a breadth of information on the
innovation process at the firm level. They can identify motives and obstacles
to innovation, changes in the way firms operate, the kinds of innovation
activity that they engage in, and the types of innovations that they implement.
In terms of the innovation process as a system, innovation surveys can
provide information on firms’ linkages with other actors in the economy and
on the methods they use to protect their innovations. These areas are
discussed in greater detail below.
123. There are also limitations to the ty pes of data that can be obtained by
innovation surveys. First, analysis will  often require additional economic data
on the firm, so that data from inno vation surveys will often need to be
combined with other information sources.
124. Second, innovation is a continuous process, and therefore difficult to
measure, particularly for firms whose innovation activity is mainlycharacterised by small, incremental changes as opposed to single, well-defined
projects to implement significant chan ges. Innovations are defined in the
Manual as significant changes, with the intention of distinguishing significantchanges from routine, minor changes. However, it is important to recognise that
an innovation can also consist of a series of minor incremental changes.
125. Third, information on innovation expenditures is normally not specified
in firms’ financial accounts, making it difficult for firms to calculate them. While
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200541this does not preclude measuring inno vation expenditures, these difficulties
should be taken into account both in survey design and subsequent analysis.
126. Fourth, it is difficult for surveys to capture the timing of innovation
activities, their implementation and th eir impact. Expenditures on innovation
activities are intended to yield potent ial returns in the future. The outputs of
these activities, from the development and implementation of innovations to
improvements in innovative capacity to impacts on performance, are oftennot observable during the review period.
127. Finally, innovation surveys are not well placed to provide information on
the general institutional environment, su ch as the education system, the labour
market and financial systems, with th e exception of how these institutional
factors are experienced by  the respondent firms.
5.2. Inputs to innovation
128. A broad understanding of the dist ribution of innovation activities
across industries is of obvious importance for innovation policy. An important
goal is to understand the role of R& D and non-R&D inputs in the innovation
process and how R&D may be interrelated  with other innovation inputs. Better
information on the prevalence of non- R&D innovation inputs is particularly
important for many services as they  make use of R&D less frequently.
129. Innovation activities can lead  both to the development and
implementation of innovations over th e short term and to improvements in
the innovative capacity of the firm. The firm learns by developing and
implementing innovations, gaining valuable inputs from interactions and
marketing activity, and improving its innovative capacity throughorganisational changes.
130. Innovation surveys can provide both  qualitative and quantitative data
on firms’ innovation inputs. Collecti ng quantitative data poses practical
difficulties, especially when firms have many divisions, but data on
innovation inputs are one of the most useful outputs of innovation surveys.
5.3. Linkages and the role of diffusion
131. Innovation surveys can provide data for use in analyses of
technological change and productivity growth based on tracking flows of new
knowledge and technologies from one industry to another. An example is theuse of ICTs in a wide variety of products. How do firms incorporate new
knowledge and innovations that have been developed elsewhere? Also, what
is the relative weight of diffusion compared to creative innovation?
132. A separate but related issue concerns interactions both among
organisations and between organisations and their surroundings. Systems
approaches often highlight linkages as the most vital area for promoting
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200542innovation activity. It is important to determine both the types of interaction
and the main sources of  external knowledge.
133. These interactions can consist of informal contacts and information
flows, or more formal collaboration on innovation projects. They include
adjustments in the value chain, such as  closer relationships with suppliers or
users, or research on market dema nd or on the potential uses for
technologies. Firms may have close relationships with other firms within anindustry cluster or be part of looser  networks. They may draw on published
work from public research institutions or work directly with them on
collaborative projects.
134. Innovation surveys can highlight th e specific kinds of information of
use for innovation and the types of in stitutions and transmission mechanisms
that are available to firms. These include data on information sources,
knowledge and technology flows, and collaborative partners as well as on
barriers to innovation owing to a lack of information, for example on
technologies or markets.
5.4. The impact of innovation
135. Of particular interest to innovation policy is the effect of innovation on
output, productivity and employment, both at the national level and forspecific sectors and regions. Better info rmation on the conditions for success
could help improve policies aimed at achieving the economic and social
benefits of innovation.
136. Innovation surveys can provide both  qualitative and quantitative data
on the outcomes of innovations. In a ddition, survey data can very useful as
input to subsequent empirical analyses of the impacts of innovation.
5.5. Incentives and obstacles to innovation
137. Many policies for supporting in novation would benefit from the
identification of the main forces that drive firms’ innovation activity. These
forces can be market-related, concerned with increasing quality or efficiency,
or involve adapting the firm’s organisation to better fit its needs. Informationon the objectives of innovation is readily obtained through innovation
surveys.
138. Obstacles to innovation are significant for policy as well, since a good
proportion of government measures are, in one way or another, aimed at
overcoming them. Many obstacles – skil l shortages, problems of competence,
finance and appropriation – are relatively straightforward to assess withsurvey methods.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005435.6. Demand
139. Demand factors shape innovation activity in a number of ways.
Demand affects the development of new products, as firms modify and
differentiate products to increase sale s and market share. Demand factors can
force firms to improve their producti on and supply processes in order to
reduce costs and lower prices. In many ca ses, they are also the main driver of
innovation. Firms often spend substant ial resources on researching demand
and can adopt marketing measures to in fluence or create demand for their
products. Market factors determine the commercial success of specific
technologies or products and affect the path of technological change. They
may also determine whether or not firms innovate. If firms do not believe thatthere is sufficient demand for new products in their market, they may decide
either not to innovate or to delay innovation activities.
140. Both the measuremen t and analysis of th e role of demand in
innovation are problematic. It is very difficult to isolate demand effects from
supply, and little is known about how to measure demand effects in surveys.
Nevertheless, some aspects of demand may be covered in a survey, such as theextent to which innovations in products and services, and in the way they are
provided, are driven through articulated customer requirements, or are
supply-driven. The nature of customers and users is also a demand factor that
the innovating firm takes into account. Some information can be obtained
through innovation surveys in terms of the importance of market-related
factors (both positive and negative) on innovation activity.
5.7. Other
5.7.1. Human resources
141. Much innovation knowledge is embo died in people and their skills,
and appropriate skills are needed to ma ke intelligent use of external sources
or codified knowledge. The role of huma n capital in innovation is important at
both the firm and the aggregate level. Some issues of interest here are the
quality of the education system an d how well it matches the needs of
innovative firms and other organisations;  what efforts firms make to invest in
the human capital of their employees ; whether innovation activity is
hampered by shortages of qualified personnel; whether there are sufficient
opportunities for worker training; and ho w adaptive the workforce is in terms
of the structure of the labour market and mobility across regions and sectors.
However, methods for measuring the role of human capital in innovation are
not well developed, and limited info rmation is available from innovation
surveys.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005445.7.2. Laws and regulations
142. Laws and regulations are part of the framework in which firms
operate. Well-designed regulations and standards can provide a strong signal
to support and guide innovative activities. They affect access to information,
property rights, tax and administrative burdens (in particular for small firms)
and environmental standards. All are important for innovation policy, but
policy needs can vary greatly from sector to sector.
143. For example, policies that reduce administrative barriers for SMEs can
have a significant effect on innovati on activity in smaller firms. Clear
intellectual property rights are also vital for improving incentives to innovate
in some industries. Innovation surveys can provide data on these issuesthrough questions on obstacles to i nnovation and on the appropriation
methods used by innovative firms.

Basic Definitions
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005461. Introduction
144. Based on the concepts presented in Chapter 2, this chapter aims to
provide concise definitions for types of innovations, innovation activities and
innovative firms.1 Given the complexity of the innovation process and the
variations in the way innovation occurs in firms, conventions have to be
adopted in order to provide operational definitions that can be used instandardised surveys of firms.
145. The Manual distinguishes innovation in four areas: product, process,
marketing and organisational. Product and process innovations are familiarconcepts in the business sector, and were the sole focus of the previous
editions of the Manual, in which organisational changes were covered in an
annex and marketing innovations were not addressed. Both organisational
and marketing innovations are extensivel y discussed in this edition of the
Manual. Marketing and organisational innovations are familiar concepts to
firms in some countries and have been included in some innovation surveys,
although their definitions are generally not as well established as those for
products and processes. The definitions of these new types of innovations for
use in surveys are still under development, in much the same way as productand process innovations were in the first edition of the Oslo Manual .
2. Innovation
146. An innovation  is the implementation of a new or signific antly improved
product (good or service), or process, a ne w marketing method, or a new organisational
method inbusiness practices, workplac e organisation or external relations .
147. This broad definition of an innovation encompasses a wide range of
possible innovations. An innovation ca n be more narrowly categorised as the
implementation of one or more types of innovations, for instance product and
process innovations. This narrower definition of pr oduct and process
innovations can be related to the defi nition of technological product and
process innovation used in the second edition of the Oslo Manual .
148. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product,
process, marketing method or organisational method must be new (or
significantly improved)to the firm . This includes products, processes and
methods that firms are the first to develop and those that have been adoptedfrom other firms or organisations.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200547149. Innovation activities  are all scientific, technological, organisational, financial
and commercial steps which actually, or are intended to, lead to the implementation of
innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel
activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovationactivities also include R&D that is not dire ctly related to the development of a specific
innovation.
150. A common feature of an innovation is that it must have been
implemented . A new or improved product is implemented when it is introduced
on the market. New processes, marketing methods or organisational methods
are implemented when they are brou ght into actual use in the firm’s
operations.
151. Innovation activities vary greatly in their nature from firm to firm.
Some firms engage in well-defined innovation projects, such as thedevelopment and introduction of a new product, whereas others primarily
make continuous improvements to their products, processes and operations.
Both types of firms can be innovative: an innovation can consist of theimplementation of a single significan t change, or of a series of smaller
incremental changes that together constitute a significant change.
152. An innovative firm is one that has implemented an innovation during the
period under review .
153. The broad definition of an innovati ve firm may not be appropriate for
all policy and research needs. More narrow definitions can be useful in manycases (see sections 7 and 8 of this chapter), particularly for comparisons of
innovation across sectors, fi rm size categories or countries. An example of a
more narrow definition is a product or process innovator.
154. A product/process innovative firm  is one that has implemented a new or
significantly improved product or pr ocess during the period under review.  This
definition, which includes all firms that have implemented a product orprocess innovation, is similar to the de finition of the TPP innovative firm in
the previous edition of the Manual.
3. Main type of innovation
155. Four types of innovations are distinguished: product innovations, process
innovations, marketing innovations  and organisational innovations . This
classification maintains the largest po ssible degree of continuity with the
previous definition of technological product and process innovation used in
the second edition of the Manual. Product innovations and process
innovations are closely related to the concept of technological productinnovation and technological process innovation. Marketing innovations and
organisational innovations broaden the range of innovations covered by the
Manual as compared to the previous definition.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200548156. A product innovation isthe introduction of a good  or service that is new or
significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This
includes significant improvements in te chnical specifications, components and
materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics.
157. Product innovations can utilise new knowledge or technologies, or can
be based on new uses or combinations of existing knowledge or technologies.
The term “product” is used to cover both goods and services. Productinnovations include both the introduc tion of new goods and services and
significant improvements in  the functional or user characteristics of existing
goods and services.
158. New products are goods and services that differ significantly in their
characteristics or intended uses from products previously produced by the
firm. The first microprocessors and digital cameras were examples of newproducts using new technologies. The first portable MP3 player, which
combined existing software standa rds with miniaturised hard-drive
technology, was a new product combining existing technologies.
159. The development of a new use for a product with only minor changes
to its technical specifications is a product innovation. An example is the
introduction of a new detergent using an existing chemical composition that
was previously used as an intermediary for coating production only.
160. Significant improvements to existing products can occur through changes
in materials, components and other characteristics that enhanceperformance. The introduction of ABS braking, GPS (Global Positioning
System) navigational systems, or other subsystem improvements in cars is an
example of a product innovation consisting of partial changes or additions toone of a number of integrated technical subsystems. The use of breathable
fabrics in clothing is an example of a product innovation involving the use of
new materials that improves th e performance of the product.
161. Product innovations in services can include significant improvements
in how they are provided (for example, in terms of their efficiency or speed),
the addition of new functions or charac teristics to existing  services, or the
introduction of entirely new services . Examples are significant improvements
in Internet banking services, such as greatly improved speed and ease of use,
or the addition of home pick-up and dr op-off services that improve customer
access for rental cars. Providing on-site rather than remote management
contact points for outsourced services  is an example of an improvement in
service quality.
162. Design is an integral part of the development and implementation of
product innovations. However, design changes that do not involve a
significant change in a product’s functi onal characteristics or intended uses
are not product innovations. However, they can be marketing innovations, as
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200549discussed below. Routine upgrades2 or regular seasonal changes are also not
product innovations.
163. A process innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved
production or delivery method. This incl udes significant changes in techniques,
equipment and/or software.
164. Process innovations can be intended to decrease unit costs of
production or delivery, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver new orsignificantly improved products.
165. Production methods involve the techniques, equipment and software
used to produce goods or services. Ex amples of new production methods are
the implementation of new automation eq uipment on a production line or the
implementation of computer-assiste d design for product development.
166. Delivery methods concern the logi stics of the firm and encompass
equipment, software and techniques to source inputs, allocate supplies within
the firm, or deliver final products. An example of a new delivery method is the
introduction of a bar-coded or active RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
goods-tracking system.
167. Process innovations include new or significantly improved methods for
the creation and provision of services. They can involve significant changes inthe equipment and software used in services-oriented firms or in the
procedures or techniques that are employed to deliver services. Examples are
the introduction of GPS tracking devices for transport services, theimplementation of a new reservation system in a travel agency, and the
development of new techniques for managing projects in a consultancy firm.
168. Process innovations also cover new or significantly improved
techniques, equipment and software in ancillary support activities, such as
purchasing, accounting, computing and maintenance. The implementation of
new or significantly improved info rmation and commun ication technology
(ICT) is a process innovation if it is intended to improve the efficiency and/or
quality of an ancillary support activity.
169. A marketing innovation  is the implementation of a new marketing method
involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement,
product promotion or pricing.
170. Marketing innovations are aimed at better addressing customer needs,
opening up new markets, or newly positi oning a firm’s product on the market,
with the objective of increasing the firm’s sales.
171. The distinguishing feature of a marketing innovation compared to
other changes in a firm’s marketing instruments is the implementation of a
marketing method not previously used by the firm. It must be part of a new
marketing concept or strategy that represents a significant departure from the
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200550firm’s existing marketing methods. Th e new marketing method can either be
developed by the innovating firm or adopted from other firms or
organisations. New marketing methods can be implemented for both new and
existing products.
172. Marketing innovations include significant changes in product design
that are part of a new marketing concep t. Product design changes here refer to
changes in product form and appearance that do not alter the product’sfunctional or user characte ristics. They also include changes in the packaging
of products such as foods, beverages and detergents, where packaging is the
main determinant of the product’s appearance. An example of a marketinginnovation in product design is the im plementation of a significant change in
the design of a furniture line to give it a new look and broaden its appeal.
Innovations in product design can also include the introducti on of significant
changes in the form, appearance or taste of food or beverage products, such as
the introduction of new flavours for a food product in order to target a new
customer segment. An example of a mark eting innovation in packaging is the
use of a fundamentally new bottle design  for a body lotion, which is intended
to give the product a distinctive look and appeal to a new market segment.
173. New marketing methods in product placement  primarily involve the
introduction of new sales channels. Sale s channels here refer to the methods
used to sell goods and services to customers, and not logistics methods
(transport, storing and handling of products) which deal mainly withefficiency. Examples of marketing inno vations in product placement are the
introduction for the first time of a franchising system, of direct selling or
exclusive retailing, and of product licensing. Innovations in productplacement can also involve the use of new concepts for the presentation of
products. An example is the introduction  of salesrooms for furniture that are
redesigned according to themes, allowing  customers to view products in fully
decorated rooms.
174. New marketing methods in product promotion  involve the use of new
concepts for promoting a firm’s goods and services. For example, the first useof a significantly different media or technique – such as product placement in
movies or television programmes, or th e use of celebrity endorsements – is a
marketing innovation. Another example is branding, such as the developmentand introduction of a fundamentally ne w brand symbol (as distinguished from
a regular update of the brand’s appearance) which is intended to position the
firm’s product on a new market or give the product a new image. Theintroduction of a personalised information system, e.g.obtained from loyalty
cards, to tailor the presentation of prod ucts to the specific needs of individual
customers can also be consid ered a marketing innovation.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200551175. Innovations in pricing  involve the use of new pricing strategies to
market the firm’s goods or services. Examples are the first use of a new
method for varying the price of a g ood or service according to demand
(e.g.when demand is low, the price is low) or the introduction of a new method
which allows customers to choose desire d product specificat ions on the firm’s
Web site and then see the price for the specified product. New pricing
methods whose sole purpose is to diff erentiate prices by customer segments
are not considered innovations.
176. Seasonal, regular and other routin e changes in marketing instruments
are generally not marketing innovations. For such changes to be marketing
innovations, they must involve marketing methods not previously used by the
firm. For example, a significant change in a product’s design or packaging that
is based on a marketing concept that has already been used by the firm forother products is not a marketing innovation, nor is the use of existing
marketing methods to target a new geographical market or a new market
segment ( e.g.socio-demographic group of clients).
177. An organisational innovation  is the implementation of a new organisational
method in the firm’s business practices, wo rkplace organisation or external relations.
178. Organisational innovations can be intended to increase a firm’s
performance by reducing administrative costs or transaction costs, improving
workplace satisfaction (and thus labour  productivity), gaining access to non-
tradable assets (such as non-codified external knowledge) or reducing costs ofsupplies.
179. The distinguishing features of an organisational innovation compared
to other organisational changes in a firm is the implementation of an
organisational method (in business pr actices, workplace organisation or
external relations) that has not been us ed before in the firm and is the result
of strategic decisions taken by management.
180. Organisational innovations in business practices  involve the
implementation of new methods for organising routines and procedures for
the conduct of work. These include, fo r example, the impl ementation of new
practices to improve learning and knowledge sharing within the firm. An
example is the first implementation of practices for codifying knowledge,
e.g.establishing databases of best practi ces, lessons and other knowledge, so
that they are more easily accessible to others. Another example is the first
implementation of practices for employee development and improving
worker retention, such as education an d training systems. Other examples are
the first introduction of management  systems for general production or
supply operations, such as supply chain management systems, business re-
engineering, lean production, and quality-management systems.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200552181. Innovations in workplace organisation  involve the implementation of
new methods for distributing responsi bilities and decision making among
employees for the division of work within and between firm activities (and
organisational units), as well as new co ncepts for the structuring of activities,
such as the integration of different business activities. An example of an
organisational innovation in workplace organisation is the first
implementation of an organisational model that gives the firm’s employees
greater autonomy in decision making an d encourages them to contribute their
ideas. This may be achieved through the decentralisation of group activity and
management control or the establishmen t of formal or informal work teams
in which individual workers have more flexible job responsibilities. However,
organisational innovations may also invo lve the centralisation of activity and
greater accountability for decision making. An example of organisational
innovation in the structuring of business  activities is the introduction for the
first time of build-to-order produc tion systems (integrating sales and
production) or the integration of engineering and development withproduction.
182. New organisational methods in a firm’s external relations  involve the
implementation of new ways of organisi ng relations with other firms or public
institutions, such as the establishment of new types of collaborations with
research organisations or customer s, new methods of integration with
suppliers, and the outsourcing or subcontr acting for the first time of business
activities in production, procuring, distribution, recruiting and ancillary
services.
183. Changes in business practices, workplace organisation or external
relations that are based on organisational methods already in use in the firm
are not organisational innovations. Nor is the formulat ion of managerial
strategies in itself an innovation. However, organisational changes that areimplemented in response to a new managerial strategy are an innovation if
they represent the first implementation of a new organisational method in
business practices, workplace organisati on or external relations. For example,
the introduction of a written strategy document to improve the efficient use of
the firm’s knowledge is not, by itself, an innovation. Innovation occurs when
the strategy is implemented through the use of new software and practices for
documenting information in order to encourage knowledge sharing among
different divisions.
184. Mergers with, or the acquisition of, other firms are not considered
organisational innovations, even if a fi rm merges with or acquires other firms
for the first time. Mergers and acqu isitions may involve organisational
innovations, however, if the firm develops or adopts new organisationmethods in the course of the merger or acquisition.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005534. Distinguishing between types of innovations
185. It is important for survey purposes to be able to distinguish between
innovation types in borderline cases.  However, many innovations may have
characteristics that span more than one type of innovation. It can be both
difficult and misleading, in terms of ty pes of innovation activities undertaken
by firms, to categorise these innovation s as a single type. This section provides
guidelines for distinguishing between the different types of innovations.
186. Collecting data on the different ch aracteristics of an innovation that
spans several innovation types will rarely create problems for interpretationand, in fact, will usually improve the quality of the results. For example, a firm
that introduces a new product which also requires the development of a new
process is clearly both a product and a process innovator. The same is true fora firm that introduces a new marketing method in order to market a new
product, or a firm that adopts for the first time a new organisational method
in the course of the introduction of a new process technology.
4.1. Distinguishing between product and process innovations
187. With respect to goods, the distinction between products and processesis clear . With respect to services, however , it may be less clear , as the
production, delivery and consumption of  many services can occur at the same
time. Some distinguishing guidelines are:
●If the innovation involves new or significantly improved characteristics of
the service offered to customers,  it is a product innovation.
●If the innovation involves new or significantly improved methods,
equipment and/or skills used to perform the service, it is a process
innovation.
●If the innovation involves significant improvements in both the
characteristics of the service offered and in the methods, equipment and/or
skills used to perform the service, it is both a product and a process
innovation.
In many cases, a service innovation may be only of one type. For example,
firms can offer a new service or new characteristics of a service without
significantly changing the method of providing the service. Likewise,significant process improvements, for inst ance to reduce delivery costs, may
make no difference to the characteristics of the service that is sold to
customers.

ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005544.2. Distinguishing between product innovations and marketing 
innovations
188. The main distinguishing factor fo r product and marketing innovations
is a significant change in the product’ s functions or uses. Goods or services
which have significantly improved functional or user characteristics
compared to existing products are product innovations. On the other hand,the adoption of a new marketing concept that involves a significant change in
the design of an existing product is a marketing innovation but not a product
innovation, as long as the functional or  user characteristics of the product are
not significantly changed. As an exampl e, clothes produced using new fabrics
with improved performance (breatha ble, waterproof, etc.) are product
innovations, but the first introduction of a new shape for clothes intended for
a new group of customers or to give the product a higher degree of exclusivity
(and thus allow for a higher mark-up co mpared to the previous version of the
product), is a marketing innovation.
189. In some cases innovations can be considered both product and
marketing innovations, if firms implem ent changes to existing products that
involve both significant changes in the functions or uses of the product and
significant changes in the product’s form and appearance or packaging which
are part of a new marketing concept.
4.3. Distinguishing between service (product) innovations and 
marketing innovations
190. The main distinguishing factor fo r service innovations and marketing
innovations is whether the innovation involves a marketing method or a
service ( i.e.a product). Firms will generally be able to distinguish between
their sales/marketing meth ods and their products.
191. The distinction may depend on the nature of the firm’s business. An
example is an innovation involving Internet sales. For a firm that producesand sells goods, the introduction of e-commerce for the first time is a
marketing innovation in product placement. Firms that are in the business of
e-commerce ( e.g. “auction” firms, Web site prov iders that allow other firms to
advertise or sell their products, firms ar ranging the sale of travel tickets, etc.)
are offering “sales services”. For these firms, a significant change in the
characteristics or capabilities of their Web site is a product (service)innovation.
192. Some innovations are both product and marketing innovations, for
example, if a firm implements a new sales and customer service operation,
introducing both a new way of marketin g its products (direct selling) while
also offering additional services ( e.g.repair) and product information to
customers.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005554.4. Distinguishing between process and marketing innovations
193. Both process and mark eting innovations can involve new methods of
moving information or goods, but thei r purposes differ. Process innovations
involve production and delivery me thods and other ancillary support
activities aimed at decreasing unit cost s or increasing product quality, while
marketing innovations aim at increasing  sales volumes or market share, the
latter through changes in product positioning or reputation.
194. Borderline cases can arise for marketing innovations that involve the
introduction of new sales channels. For example, innovations that involve the
introduction of a new sales channel ( i.e.a new way of selling goods and
services to customers) may also includ e the implementation of new logistics
methods ( i.e.the transport, storage and handling of products). If these
innovations are aimed both at increasing  sales and reducing unit distribution
costs, they should be considered both process and marketing innovations.
4.5. Distinguishing between process and organisational innovations
195. Distinguishing between process and organisational innovations isperhaps the most frequent borderline case for innovation surveys since both
types of innovation attempt – among othe r things – to decrease costs through
new and more efficient concepts of  production, delivery and internal
organisation. Many innovations thus  contain aspects of both types of
innovation. For example, the introducti on of new processes may also involve
the first use of new organisational  methods such as group working.
Organisational innovations such as the first introduction of a total quality
management system may involve sign ificant improvements in production
methods, such as new production logist ic systems, to avoid certain types of
flaws or new and more efficient info rmation systems based on new software
and new ICT equipment.
196. A starting point for distinguishing process and/or organisational
innovations is the type of activity: pr ocess innovations deal mainly with the
implementation of new equipment, so ftware and specific techniques or
procedures, while organisational innova tions deal primarily with people and
the organisation of work. Guidelines fo r distinguishing the two in borderline
cases are as follows:
●If the innovation involves new or significantly improved production or
supply methods that are intended to de crease unit costs or increase product
quality, it is a process innovation.
●If the innovation involves the first use of new organisational methods in the
firm’s business practices, workplace orga nisation or external relations, it is
an organisational innovation.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200556●If the innovation involves both new or significantly improved production or
supply methods and the first use of or ganisation methods, it is both a
process and an organisational innovation.
4.6. Distinguishing between marketing and organisational innovations
197. Borderline cases may arise for innovations that involve theintroduction for the first time of both  marketing and organisational methods.
As noted above, if an innovation has characteristics of both types ofinnovations, then it is both a mark eting innovation and an organisational
innovation. However, organisational in novations that involve sales activities
(e.g.the integration of sales with other departments), but do not involve the
introduction of new marketing methods, are not marketing innovations.
5. Changes which are not considered innovations
5.1. Ceasing to use a process, a marketing method or an organisation 
method, or to market a product
198. It is not an innovation to stop doing something, even if it improves a
firm’s performance. For example, it is not an innovation when a television
manufacturer ceases to produce and sell a combined television and DVD
player, or a property development agency or construction company stopsbuilding retirement villages. Similarly, ceasing to use a certain marketing or
organisational method is not an innovation.
5.2. Simple capital replacement or extension
199. The purchase of identical models of installed equipment, or minor
extensions and updates to existing eq uipment or software, are not process
innovations. New equipment or extensions  must both be new to the firm and
involve a significant improvement in specifications.
5.3. Changes resulting purely from changes in factor prices
200. A change in the price of a product or in the productivity of a process
resulting exclusively from changes in the price of factors of production is not
an innovation. For example, an innovation does not occur when the samemodel of PC is constructed and sold at a lower price simply because the price
of computer chips falls.
5.4. Customisation
201. Firms engaged in custom producti on make single and often complex
items according to customers’ orde rs. Unless the one-off item displays
significantly different attributes from products that the firm has previously
made, it is not a product innovation.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200557202. Note that the above concerns prod uct changes from customisation and
not the implementation of customised production itself. For example, the
integration of production, sales and delivery operations is an organisational
innovation.
5.5. Regular seasonal and other cyclical changes
203. In certain industries such as clothing and footwear there are seasonalchanges in the type of goods or services provided which may be accompaniedby changes in the appearance of th e products concerned. These types of
routine changes in design are generally neither product nor marketing
innovations. For example, the introduction of the new season’s anoraks by aclothing manufacturer is not a produc t innovation unless the anoraks have,
for example, a lining with significantly improved characteristics. However, if
the occasion of seasonal changes is used for a fundamental change in productdesign that is part of a new marketing approach used for the first time by the
firm, this should be considered a marketing innovation.
5.6. Trading of new or significantly improved products
204. The situation for new products is complicated in the goods-handling
services and distributive trades (whole sale and retail distribution, transport
and storage). Trading of new or improved products is generally not a product
innovation for the wholesaler, retail ou tlet or transport and storage firm.
However , if such a firm begins to deal with a new line of goods ( i.e.types of
goods that the firm has not previously sold) then this activity is to be
considered a product innovation, as the firm is offering a new service.
6. Novelty and diffusion
205. By definition, all innovations must contain a degree of novelty. Three
concepts for the novelty of innovations are discussed below: new to the firm,
new to the market, and new to the world.
206. The developer of the innovation, discussed in Chapter 5, is also related
to novelty and diffusion and establishes whether innovations are mainly
developed within enterprises themselves or in co-operation with otherenterprises or public research institutions, or whether they are mainly
developed outside the enterprise.
207. As noted above, the minimum entry level for an innovation is that it
must be new to the firm . A product, process,  marketing method or
organisational method may already have been implemented by other firms,
but if it is new to the firm (or in case of products and processes: significantlyimproved), then it is an innovation for that firm.
3
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200558208. The concepts new to the market  and new to the world  concern whether or
not a certain innovation has already been implemented by other firms, or
whether the firm is the first in the ma rket or industry or worldwide to have
implemented it. Firms that first develop innovations can be considered driversof the process of innovation. Many new ideas and knowledge originate from
these firms, but the economic impact of  the innovations will depend on the
adoption of the innovations by other firms. Information on the degree ofnovelty can be used to identify the developers and adopters of innovations, to
examine patterns of diffusion, and to id entify market leaders and followers.
209. Innovations are new to the market  when the firm is the first to
introduce the innovation on its market. The market is simply defined as the
firm and its competitors and it can includ e a geographic region or product line.
The geographical scope of new to the market is thus subject to the firm’s ownview of its operating market and thus may include both domestic and
international firms.
210. An innovation is new to the wo rld when the firm is the first to
introduce the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and
international. New to the world ther efore implies a qualitatively greater
degree of novelty than new to the market. While many surveys may find thatquestions on new to the market are sufficient to examine the degree of
novelty for innovations, new to the world provides an option for surveys that
wish to examine novelty in greater detail.
211. A related concept is a radical or disr uptive innovation. It can be defined
as an innovation that has a significant impact on a market and on the
economic activity of firms in that ma rket. This concept focuses on the impact
of innovations as opposed to their no velty. The impact can, for example,
change the structure of the market, cr eate new markets or render existing
products obsolete (Christensen, 1997). However, it might not be apparentwhether an innovation is disruptive un til long after it has been introduced.
This makes it difficult to collect data on disruptive innovations within the
period reviewed in an innovation survey.
7. The innovative firm
212. The innovative status of a firm can be defined in several ways. Thebasic definition of an innovative firm (see Section 2) is a firm that hasimplemented at least one innovation, wh ile a product or process innovator is
defined as a firm that has implemen ted either a product or a process
innovation.
213. Further ways of classifying an innovative firm are possible, depending
on policy or research needs. They can be used to specify the percentage of
firms (by size class, sector, country or ot her factor) that introduces each of the
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200559four types of innovations, or the share of firms that have implemented
combinations of innovations, such as  product and marketing innovations or
process and organisational innovations. Classification by innovative status
can also include other information, fo r example about the developer of the
innovation, which may be used to identify firms that only adopt product and
process innovations developed by other firms.
214. Firms may have innovation activities in the period under review
without having actually im plemented an innovation. All activities involved in
the development or implementation of innovations, including those planned
for implementation in the future, are innovation activities (see Section 2).
During a given period, innovation activities can be of three kinds:
●Successful  in having resulted in the im plementation of an innovation
(although the innovation need not have been commercially successful).
●Ongoing , for work in progress which has not yet resulted in the
implementation of an innovation.
●Abandoned  before the implementation of an innovation.
Innovation activities are specified in detail in Chapter 6.
215. An innovation-active firm  is one that has had innovation activities during the
period under review, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities . In other
words, firms that have had innovation  activities during the period under
review, regardless of whether the activity  resulted in the implementation of an
innovation, are innovation-active.
216. Firms can have come into existenc e during the period under review.
These include both newly established fi rms and firms that are the result of
mergers, demergers or other kinds of re organisation. The innovation status of
these firms, such as whether they ar e innovative or innovation-active, is
defined in the same way as for all other firms.
8. Collecting data on innovations
217. Depending on survey objectives and scope, data collection oninnovations can take various approaches. A comprehensive approach would
cover all four types of innovations equally. Alternatively, product and processinnovations might be maintained as the core innovation types but marketing
and organisational innovations might be partly covered, or product and
process innovations might be the exclus ive focus. In addition, one or more
types of innovation can be covered in  greater detail through specialised
surveys.
218. The guidelines presented here and in subsequent chapters outline a
number of options for data collection. Clearly, it is not feasible to cover all
topics and subtopics in one innovation  survey, and surveys must choose the
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200560questions that are deemed most releva nt. A limited set of topics which are
considered particularly important for innovation surveys are recommended in
bold type.
219. Data on each type of innovation can be collected through a single question
or through a series of su b-questions on separate su bgroups of each type of
innovation. The latter option will result  in more detailed information on the
innovations of each firm. Greater detail on the types of innovations firms haveimplemented would be very useful fo r data analysis and interpretation.
220. Information on supplementary fact ors, such as linkages, innovation
objectives and barriers to innovation, can be collected separately for each typeof innovation, or for closely related su bsets of the four types, such as a
combination of product and process innovation. For some supplementary
questions, collecting data for all four  types of innovation combined can make
interpretation of the data more difficult. For example, combining all four types
of innovation in questions on linkages would make it very difficult to
determine if a specific linkage was us ed in developing a product, process,
marketing or organisational innovation.
221. Length constraints make separate  questions on each supplementary
factor for each type of innovation somewhat problematic. Taking this intoaccount, Chapters 6 and 7 outline options for supplementary questions:
referring to all four types of innovati ons combined, focusing on product and
process innovations, or directing questi ons at individual types of innovations.
Chapter 5 provides guidelines for direct ing questions on linkages towards all
four types (either combined or separately) or to a subset of types, such as
product and process innovations. Chapter 6 separates product and processinnovation activities from activities for marketing and organisational
innovations. Chapter 7 lists objectives, hindering factors and other indicators
for each individual type of innovation . These lists can be equally useful for
questions that focus solely on a subset of innovations, either those that cover
all innovation types, or those that cover individual types of innovations.
222. Innovations spanning more than one type, such as those including
both a process and an organisational component, might play an increasingly
important role in firm competitiveness and in productivity gains. For example,
a restructuring of production operations  could involve process, organisational
and marketing innovations, or a marketing and organisational innovation
could be implemented in order to bette r profit from a product innovation.
223. One option is to include questions on the connections between
different types of innovations. Of part icular interest is the link between
organisational and process innovations,  although connections between other
types, such as product and marketing innovations or product and processinnovations, can also be of interest.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200561224. To ensure comparability, surveys must specify an observation period
for questions on innovation. It is recommended that the length of the
observation period for innovation surv eys should not exceed three years or
be less than one year.  Factors influencing the choi ce of the length of the
observation period are discussed in Chapter 8 on survey methods. The same
observation period should be used for all questions in an innovation survey,
with the exception of a few quantitative indicators that are difficult to collect
and should therefore refer to the most recent year of the observation period,
the reference year .
225. The concept of novelty is in principle applicable to all four types of
innovations, possibly to differing degrees. Questions on novelty are likely to be
easiest to answer for product innovations.  Firms may find questions on the novelty
of process innovations more difficult, as they may lack full knowledge of otherfirms’ production and delivery methods. The concept of novelty is applicable for
most marketing innovations (such as new methods in contracting, product
placement and product promotion), though  less relevant for new concepts of
product design. For organisational innova tion, some new organisational methods
may be specific to an individual firm, thereby complicating comparison with other
firms, and firms may lack information on whether certain organisational methodshave already been applied by other firms.
226. It is recommended that innovation  surveys ask whether any product
innovations introduced during the observation period were new to themarket.  Innovation surveys can also collect data on new to the market process
innovations. An additional option is to ask whether these types of innovations
were new to the world.
Notes
1. In this chapter, the generic term, “the firm”, is used. The primary statistical unit
for collecting data, which in general is the enterprise, is discussed in Chapter 4. In
particular, the question of what is “new to the firm” becomes more complicated
when considering large enterprise groups  or multinational enterprises. These
issues will be considered in Chapter 4. 
2. A routine upgrade involves minor changes to a good or service that are expected
and planned for in advance. The development of the upgrade is also based on
routine, well-established activities. For example, anti-virus software is purchased
with the expectation of frequent upgrades  to cover the appearance of new viruses.
A hotel chain will construct new hotels with the expectation that furnishings,
lamps and bathroom fixtures will be upgraded on a regular basis, even though this
may be on a 10- or 20-year cycle.
3. By “firm” is meant, the statistical unit for which data is compiled, which in general
is the enterprise . New to the firm  thus implies new to the statistical unit.

Institutional Classifications
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005641. The approach
227. The institutional approach focuses on the characteristic properties of
the innovative firm. All characteristics of innovation activities, and theirinputs and outputs, are cl assified to one class or subclass according to the
unit’s principal activity.
2. The units
228. A clear distinction should be ma de between the reporting unit, the
observation unit and the statistical unit. The reporting unit  is the entity from
which the recommended items of data are collected. They may vary from
sector to sector and from country to  country, depending on institutional
structures, the legal status  of data collection, tradition, national priorities
and survey resources. It is therefor e difficult to make international
recommendations about the reporting unit for innovation surveys. However,
whenever countries provide statistics  for international comparisons, the
reporting units should be specified.
229. The observation unit  is the entity that the received data refer to. The
observation unit is equivalent to the reporting unit if the data received refer
to the same unit as the reporting unit.1 The statistical unit may be an
observation unit on which information is  received and statistics are compiled,
or an analytical unit which statistici ans create by splitting or combining
observation units with the help of estimations or imputations in order tosupply more detailed and/or homogeneous data than would otherwise be
possible.
230. As far as possible, the statistical unit should be uniform for all
countries. This goal ma y , however , be difficult to achieve in practice. One
reason is that legal structures differ from country to country. Definitions of
units, such as the enterprise, may also  vary across countries. Another reason
is the interaction of the statistical unit  with the observation or reporting unit.
If the reporting or the observation unit is  larger than the statistical unit, there
may be problems in distributing the data  into the appropriate statistical units.
231. I d e a l l y ,  i n n o v a t i o n  d a t a  s h o u l d  b e  c o m p i l e d  ( a n d  c o l l e c t e d )  a t  t h e
organisational level for which decisions on innovation activity are made.
Taking into account how innovation activities are usually organised, theenterprise is in general the most appropriate statistical unit . However, no
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200565single definition of an enterprise is used in all countries. The two main
definitions are those of the ISIC and the EU. According to ISIC Rev. 3.1,
§§ 54-55, an enterprise has “autonomy in  respect of financial and investment
decision making, as well as author ity and responsibility for allocating
resources for the production of goods and services. It may be engaged in one
or many productive activities. The ente rprise is the level at which financial
and balance sheet accounts are maintained and from which internationaltransactions, and international investme nt position (when applicable) and the
consolidated financial position can be  derived”. The EU definition of an
enterprise is somewhat narrower: “The enterprise is the smallest combination
of legal units that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which
benefits from a certain degree of autono my in decision making, especially for
the allocation of its current resources.  An enterprise carries out one or more
activities at one or more locations.”
2
232. While the two definitions are very simi lar, a central difference is that a
group of enterprises is not an enterprise according to the EU definition (since
it does not comprise the smallest combination of legal units that is an
organisational unit), while an enterprise group still falls within the ISIC
definition of an enterprise. Common characteristics are that enterprises
exercise a certain degree of autonomy in decision making and have full
financial accounts.
2.1. The primary statistical unit
233. The enterprise unit  is the appropriate primary statistical unit in
innovation surveys in most cases. The enterprise unit should, however, not be
confused with the entity “legal unit”.  While legal units are independent in a
legal sense, they may not necessar ily constitute independent economic
entities with decision-making autonomy  for their productive activities. This
point follows from the EU definition of  an enterprise and ISIC Rev. 3.1, §49.3
This is important for samples drawn fr om business registers based on legal
units, as data from legal units without decision-making autonomy may not becomparable with data from enterprises. If data are collected for legal units, it
is desirable to compile the data for st atistical use at the enterprise level.
234. The enterprise is generally the most appropriate statistical unit. It
includes:
●Enterprises that consist of a single legal unit that engages primarily in onekind of economic activity.
●Enterprises that are a group of legal un its, where the individual legal units
cannot be considered separate  economic entities, including:
❖Legal units that are vertically or hori zontally integrated in the enterprise.
❖Individual legal units that perform ancillary functions, including R&D.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200566235. Some cases require greater cl arification. These include: i)enterprise
groups; ii)large enterprises that may have several areas of activity and
iii)multinational enterprises and groups.
236. An enterprise group is an associat ion of enterprises bound together by
legal and/or financial links. For such groups, the question of whether
innovation data should be compiled at  the group level or for each individual
enterprise depends on the level at whic h decisions on innovation activity are
made. If each individual enterprise  unit has decision-making autonomy
concerning innovation, it is preferable  to collect and compile data at the
enterprise level as opposed to the group level.
237. Large enterprises may have a number of different productive activities.
For the largest, decision making on inno vation activity will likely not be made
at the highest level of the organisati on, but undertaken for each productive
activity or division. In this case, it ma y be preferable, where possible, to collect
and compile data at the level of the kind of activity unit (KAU), defined as “an
enterprise or part of an enterprise which engages in one kind of economic
activity without being restricted to the geographic area in which that activity
is carried out”.4 This means that the KAU may consist of one or more legal
units, or a part of a legal unit.
238. Multinational enterprise s (MNEs) present a number of challenges, given
that many activities may take place across national borders. For example,
innovation activities in MNEs may be undertaken jointly by units in more thanone country, and many activities may be segmented, with development
activities in one country and production and sales in another. Given that
innovation surveys are national surveys, data will be limited to domesticunit(s) of the MNE. However, it can be very useful to obtain as much
information as possible on connec tions between the domestic unit’s
innovation activities and those of unit s abroad. The following guidelines are
suggested for treating MNEs:
●The domestic part of the multinatio nal enterprise alone represents the
statistical unit to be included, regard less of the location of the enterprise’s
headquarters. Data may be collected on whether observation units are part
of MNEs (see below).
●Foreign units of an MNE should be regarded as a separate entities (not part
of the statistical unit, though belonging to the same enterprise group):
❖Joint innovation activities between th e domestic and foreign units of the
MNE should be considered as inno vation co-operation between two
enterprises in the same enterprise group. Exchanges of information or
purchases of knowledge and technology should also be treated as
transfers between two separate enterprises.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200567❖R&D activity that is conducted abroad or other new knowledge and
technology acquired abroad (and included in the accounts of the MNE’s
domestic unit) should be included in “Extramural R&D” and “Acquisition
of external knowledge”, respectively (see Chapter 6).
❖For questions on the developer of an innovation, “other enterprises” can
be broken down into those that are pa rt of a MNE or enterprise group, and
all other enterprises.
❖Innovations developed by the foreign units of a multinational enterprise
and adopted by the domestic units are innovations that are new to the
firm.
❖Innovations developed by foreign units, but not adopted by the domestic
units of a multinational enterprise, should not be included.
239. Guidelines for the primary statistical unit are summarised below :
240. Based on the discussions above, i t  i s  r e c o m m e n d e d  t h a t  d a t a  b e
collected on the institutional st atus of the observation unit:
●Whether the observation unit is part of an enterprise or enterprise group
and, if so, its function: for exampl e, headquarters, research centre,
administrative centre, marketing, other.
●Whether the observation unit is part of a multinational enterprise and, if so,
its function and where the headquarters is located.The most appropriate primary statistical unit is the enterprise, including :
●Enterprises that are single legal units with one primary economic activity.
●Enterprises that are groups of legal units that cannot be considered
separate economic entities.
●Enterprises that are part of an enterprise group, where decision making oninnovation takes place at the enterprise level:
❖In some cases for very large enterprises with more than one economic
activity, the appropriate primary statistical unit can be kind of activityunits (KAU), with the KAU consisting of one or more legal units, or partof a legal unit.
❖For MNEs, the domestic units of multinational enterprises are the
appropriate statistical units, and may either be an enterprise or part ofan enterprise ( e.g.a legal unit).
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005682.2. The secondary statistical unit
241. In some instances, there may be in terest in collecting data at a lower
organisational level than the enterprise . This may for example be the case for
compiling regional statistics or for employing a two-tiered approach to data collection.
242. In such cases, an appropriate secondary statistical unit is the
establishment unit , which can be defined (following ISIC Rev. 3.1) as: “an
enterprise or part of an enterprise, that  is situated in a single location, and in
which only a single (non-ancillary) prod uctive activity is carried out or in
which the principal productive activity accounts for most of the value added”.
An alternative is the local unit as defined by the EU.5 The secondary statistical
unit may be useful for larger enterprises that have operations in more thanone region.
243. For regional analysis, the establishment unit or similar units may be
useful
6 for collecting innovation data . However, information on some
variables should not be collected at the level of establishment (or similar) units
as they refer directly to the enterprise. An example is information on
innovation objectives, which refers to  strategic decisions at the enterprise
level which are rarely taken by establishment units.
244. For large enterprises in particular, decisions on innovation activities may
be decentralised and it may be difficult for one person  to provide data on all
innovation activities in the enterprise. An option in this case is to use a two-tiered
approach  to data collection. More than one method can be used. One is to collect
data at the establishment level and then compile the data at the enterprise level.
Regional- or establishment-level analysis can rely on the collected establishment-
level data. A drawback is that, as mentioned above, establishments may not be ina position to respond to all questions on innovation. The second method is to
collect some innovation data at the en terprise level and other data at the
establishment level. How this method is  used in practice may depend on the
preferences of the management of each enterprise.
245. Care should be taken in aggreg ating establishment results to the
enterprise level. For example, the intr oduction of a new technology can be an
innovation for an establishment but not for the enterprise if it already has
been used elsewhere in the enterprise.
3. Classification by main economic activity
246. Statistical units of innovation surveys can be broken down according to
different classifications. The most  important classification is the principal
economic activity of  the statistical unit  (“industry”). The International
Standard Industrial Classification  (ISIC Rev. 3.1) and the statistical
classification of economic activi ties in the European Community
(NACE Rev. 1.1)7 are appropriate international cl assifications for this purpose.

ISIC Rev. 3.1 should use concordance tables to convert their industrially
classified data to ISIC Rev. 3.1.
247. The  criteria for classification of statistical units by principal activity
should be determined by “the ISIC (NACE) class in which the principal activity,
or range of activities, of the unit is incl uded” (UN, 2002, ISIC Rev. 3.1, § 79). The
principal activity is the ISIC class th at accounts for the majority of the
enterprise’s value added from its goods an d services. If this is not possible, the
principal activity can be determined either on the basis of the gross output of
the goods sold or services rendered in ea ch ISIC class, by value of sales, or by
employment (UN, 2002, ISIC Rev. 3.1, § 80).Table 4.1. Industrial classification proposed for innovation surveys in the busine s

contains the basic arrang ement of the divisions,  groups and classes of
ISIC Rev. 3.1/ NACE Rev. 1.1 for the purpose of innovation statistics. The table
may be further split, or aggregated, for specific purposes.
4.  Classifications by size
249. For innovation surveys, size is the other essential classification of
statistical units. Although different vari ables can be used to define the size of
a statistical unit in innovation surveys, it is recommended that size should be
measured on the basis of number of employees . This recommendation is in
line with similar proposals in other manuals in the Frascati family. Given the
strata requirements in sample surveys (see Chapter 8), and given thatinnovation activities other than R&D are widely performed by small and
medium-sized units, it is recommended  that size classes include smaller
firms. In order to maintain international comparability while at the same timeallowing flexibility in the number of size classes, the following size classes
are recommended as a minimum :

10-49
50-249
250 and above
More detailed breakdowns by size class may also be used, such as a size class
for firms with fewer than ten employees. It is important for more detailed size
classes to be consistent with the above groups. A proposal would be:

5.1. T ype of institution
250. A further useful classification of st atistical units for innovation surveys
might be by type of institution . This breakdown seems particularly important
when the statistical unit is in general the enterprise and in view of the
increasing internationalisation of innovation activities. Taking into accountthese considerations, and similar proposals in the Frascati Manual  and the
Handbook on Economic Globalisation Indicators , it is recommended that when
enterprises are the statistical units in innovation surveys they should beclassified as follows:
Classification of statistical units for innovation surveys by type of institution
●Private enterprise:
a)National (no controlled affiliates8 (CA) abroad).
b)Multinational, of which there may be three types:
❖Foreign-controlled9 affiliates (CAs) (where the affiliate does not control
any other affiliates abroad).
❖Foreign-controlled affiliates with CAs (parent companies under foreign
control).
❖Parent companies with CAs abroad (parent company not under foreign
control).
●Public enterprise ( Frascati Manual , § 180), “resident non-financial
corporations and quasi-corporations that are subject to control by
government units, control over a corporation being defined as the ability to
determine general corporate policy by choosing appropriate directors, ifnecessary”.
5.2. Other
251. Many other types of classifications of statistical units can be used in
innovation surveys for analytical purposes. They include:
General enterprise characteristics:
●Form of activity,  with the categories: capita l-intensive/labour-intensive /
knowledge-intensive.
●T ype of goods produced,  with the categories: consumer goods/intermediate
goods/investment goods.
●Export intensity , the exports of the enterprise as a ratio of sales revenue/
turnover.10
●Geographic location .

●Innovation or R&D intensity , the ratio between innovation expenditure (or
R&D expenditure) and turnover.
●Co-operation with other enterprises/public institutions.

Linkages in the Innovation Process
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005761. Introduction
252. The innovative activities of an enterprise1 depend in part on the variety
and structure of its links to sources of  information, knowledge, technologies,
practices and human and financial resources. Linkages act as sources of
knowledge and technology for an enterprise’s innovation activity, ranging
from passive sources of information to suppliers of embodied anddisembodied knowledge and technology to co-operative partnerships. This
chapter makes recommendations on how to measure these linkages, with a
focus on links to sources ou tside the enterprise. Linkages can be related to any
of the four types of innovations ( i.e.product, process, marketing or
organisational). This chapter is designed to provide guidelines both for
measuring linkages for individual innovation types or subsets of innovationtypes (such as product and process inno vations) and for all innovation types
combined.
253. Each linkage connects the innovating enterprise to other actors in the
innovation system: government laborato ries, universities, policy departments,
regulators, competitors, suppliers an d customers. Innovation surveys can
obtain information on the prevalence and importance of different types oflinkages and on the factors that infl uence the use of specific linkages.
Identifying the linkages in innovation  activity provides evidence of the
complexity of the activity, but stops short of providing the informationnecessary for a dynamic model, with posi tive and negative feedback loops and
non-linear outcomes resulting from change. However, such information can
make a valuable contribution to understanding innovation systems and canhelp determine the influence of go vernment programmes to encourage
greater knowledge sharing or technology diffusion.
254. Linkages may depend on the nature of the enterprise and on its market
(Dierkes, 2003). For example, the innovative activities of an enterprise
operating in a stable, mature sector will  be driven by the value of its turnover
and the cost of its inputs. Under thes e circumstances, the enterprise may
focus on incremental innovation and its principal links may be to suppliers
and to customers’ market signals. In a more volatile environment, the
enterprise may need to rapidly intr oduce new products, seek new markets,
and introduce new technologies, prod uction methods and organisational
methods. The enterprise may develop multiple linkages to obtain newinformation, knowledge, technologies , production practices and human and
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200577financial resources. In all cases, information on linkages shows how the
enterprise responds to its business environment.
255. Linkages vary by source (whom or what the link is with), cost (the
amount of investment required), and level of interaction (the direction of
information flows and the level of interpersonal contact). Some external
sources consistently provide informat ion at nominal cost, such as patent
disclosures or publications, while othe rs, such as consultants, are usually
costly. The level of interaction of a linkage influences the characteristics of the
information or knowledge that can be obtained. Less interactive linkages that
require no interpersonal contact and ar e based on one-way information flows,
such as reading publications or searching patent databases, can only provide
codified information. Conversely, highly interactive linkages involving close
working relationships, such as with a supplier, can provide both codifiedinformation and tacit knowledge and real-time problem-solving assistance.
However, enterprises may avoid some types of highly complex links if they
have concerns about the loss of intellectual property.
256. A linkage can be internal to the un it or external, depending on how the
unit is defined (see Chapter 4). Even if  business units are formally organised as
separate enterprises, they may belong to the same enterprise group. Unitsmay be part of multinational enterprises so that within-enterprise links cross
national boundaries. Enterprises that be long to marketing chains (for instance
clothing) or highly integrated value chains may view linkages with other
enterprises in the chain more as internal than external.
257. The inflow of knowledge and technology is one side of what is often
referred to as diffusion. Diffusion also  involves outflows from the innovating
enterprise. Outbound diffusion  is relevant both for identifying the economic
effects of innovation and for establishing  the shape of an enterprise’s network.
As with highly interactive linkages, outbound diffusion is influenced byconcern over knowledge leakages and th e methods enterprises use to protect
their intellectual property.
258. Also related to linkages are questions on the developer of the
innovations. These questions establish whether innovations are mainly
developed by enterprises themselves or in co-operation with other enterprises
or public research institutions, or if innovations are mainly developed outsidethe enterprise.
259. The benefits of linkages will depend on how well knowledge is shared
throughout the enterprise and channe lled into the de velopment of new
products, processes and other innovations. Knowledge management  involves
practices for gaining external knowledge and interacting with other
organisations, and for sharing and utilising knowledge within the enterprise.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200578260. Trust, values and norms can ha ve an important impact on the
functioning of external relations and on the exchange of knowledge within
the enterprise. Given this, building social capital  may be a vital part of an
enterprise’s innovation strategies. The term “social capital” has many
meanings outside of economic analys is and this can lead to confusion.
Network capital  has been used as an alternative.
261. Three additional topics of relevance to linkages are covered in
Chapter 4. Several factors that hamper  innovation activity involve linkages such
as access to information and opportun ities for co-operation. The section on
the objectives and effects of innovation  addresses improving the capture and use
of knowledge. Firms may use different methods of protection to control the flow
of knowledge to other firms. These are relevant to some types of highly
interactive linkages.
2. Inbound diffusion
262. Diffusion  is the spread of innovations, through market or non-market
channels, from first implementation anyw here in the world to other countries
and regions and to other markets and firms. The diffusion process often
involves more than the mere adoption of knowledge and technology, as
adopting enterprises learn from and build on the new knowledge and
technology. Through the diffusion process, innovations may change andsupply feedback to the original innovator.
263. Identifying how transfers of know ledge and technology take place,
what the main sources of knowledge and technology flows are for enterprises,
and which of these are of greatest im portance are central to understanding
linkages in the innovation process. They result in better understanding ofdiffusion processes and make it possible to map linkages and knowledge
flows, and they are of direct relevance for innovation policy. For example,
should policy focus on promoting active co-operation and, if so, which types of
partners are most important? Or, are knowledge and technology flows of
greater importance when due to netw orks and other informal arrangements
that do not involve active co-operation?
264. This section discusses three types of linkages or flows of knowledge
and technology to enterprises: open information sources  that do not involve
purchases of knowledge and technology or interaction with the source;purchases or acquisition of knowledge and technology ; and innovation co-operation.
2.1. T ypes of linkages
265. Open information sources  provide access to knowledge without the need
to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access
(membership in trade associations, atte ndance at conferences, subscriptions
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200579to journals). Open information source s do not provide access to knowledge
embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected
by patents and other forms of intellect ual property, although the knowledge
behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some opensources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some
tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.
266. Codified knowledge can take many forms, such as published articles,
standards, metrology (methods of measur ing items such as liquid or gas flow,
time, chemical pollutants, etc.), or kn owledge gained from networks, arm’s-
length contact with suppliers, or trade fairs.
267. Some information, such as feedback  from clients or suppliers, may be
very easy to use. It may be more difficult, depending on employee capabilities,
to use other information, for exampl e from universities. An additional
challenge for using information sources is locating them. Enterprises may
have limited knowledge about potential information sources. Data on
information sources can aid in designing policy initiatives for training,improving ICT capabilities and establis hing networks and support services.
268. Knowledge networks facilitate the exchange of technology and
commercial information. Informal netw orks tend to be based on personal
contacts or “communities of  practice” or simply arise in the normal course of
business. Formal or managed networks can be organised by business
organisations such as chambers of  commerce, research associations,
technology services companies, consultants, universities or public research
organisations or sponsored by local, regional or central governments.
269. Acquisition of technology and knowledge  involves the purchase of external
knowledge and technology without active co-operation with the source. This
external knowledge can be embodied  in machinery or equipment that
incorporates this knowledge. It can al so include the hiring of employees who
possess the new knowledge, or the use of contract research and consulting
services. Disembodied technology or knowledge also includes other know-
how, patents, licences, trademarks and software.
270. Data on sources of acquisitions provide information on flows of
knowledge and technology and on where (in terms of regions, industries)
these acquisitions are most preval ent. Identifying the importance of
purchases of knowledge and technology is  also useful in motivating further
analysis of how well “trade” in knowledge and technology functions.
271. Innovation co-operation  involves active participation in joint innovation
projects with other organisations. Th ese may either be other enterprises or
non-commercial institutions. The pa rtners need not derive immediate
commercial benefit from the venture. Pure contracting out of work, where
there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as co-operation. Co-operation
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200580is distinct from open information sources and acquisition of knowledge and
technology in that all parties take an active part in the work.
272. Innovation co-operation allows enterprises to access knowledge and
technology that they would be unable to utilise on their own. There is alsogreat potential for synergies in co-operati on as partners learn from each other.
273. Innovation co-operation can take place along supply chains and involve
customers and suppliers in the joint de velopment of new products, processes or
other innovations. The level of interaction along supply chains ( i.e.whether
linkages involve co-operation, or arm’s-length exchanges of information or
purchases of technology) may depend on the type of knowledge and technology.For example, concerning product development, if the technology is non-modular,
innovation along the supply chain must be closely co-ordinated because changes
in the technological configuration of one part of a product must take account of
changes in any of the others. If the tech nologies involved are completely modular,
the assemblers of the final product can deal with suppliers of components,
materials, etc., on an arm’s- length basis, in which interaction mainly consists of
purchases of equipment or services  embodied with the new knowledge.
Exchange of technological and business information naturally accompanies trade
in goods and services. Information on cu stomer needs and their experience of a
supplier’s products plays a key role in innovation.
274. Innovation co-operation can also in volve horizontal collaboration, with
enterprises working jointly with other enterprises or public researchinstitutions. Examples are the joint development of new technologies,
products or processes by enterprises th at sell the same type of product but
possess complementary assets, e.g.sell in different geographical markets or
different market niches. Horizontal co-operation on innovation may also
include strategic marketing alliances to develop and implement new
marketing concepts. It may take plac e between enterprises that produce
different but highly complementary products, e.g.a new computer-controlled
machine tool and the software packag e needed to monitor and control it.
275. While the focus of this chapter is on external linkages, the internal
sourcing of information  is also important. The identification of which parts of
the enterprise ( e.g.R&D, marketing, production, distribution) are important
sources of information for innovation activities provides information on theflow of knowledge wi thin the enterprise.
276. The potential sources for the three types of linkages are similar, though
some are only relevant as openly available sources of knowledge andtechnology. Table 5.1 shows sources for all three types of linkages and
indicates for which types each source is relevant. It includes internal sources,
other enterprises, public and non-profit  research institutions, and a number of
general information sources. The defi nition of several sources must be
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200581adapted to country-specific terminol ogy to clearly differentiate between
commercial laboratories, government research institutes and private non-
profit research institutes.
277. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) ar e a special case. Interactions within
the MNE can take place across countries. Given that statistical units for
innovation surveys only include the domestic part of MNEs (see Chapter 4),interactions with foreign units of the MNE should be considered as external
linkages, with “other enterprise s within an enterprise group”.Table 5.1. Sources for transfers of knowledge and technology

ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005822.2. Collecting data on linkages in the innovation process
278. It is recommended that data be collected on all three types of
linkages, drawing on the list of sources above . For use in innovation surveys,
these types of linkages can be defined as:
●Open information sources:  openly available information that does not require the
purchase of technology or intellectual proper ty rights, or interaction with the source.
●Acquisition of knowledge and technology:  purchases of external knowledge and/
or knowledge and technology embodied in capital goods (machinery, equipment,software) and services, which do not involve interaction with the source.
●Innovation co-operation:  active co-operation with other enterprises or public
research institutions for innovation activities (which may include purchases ofknowledge and technology).
279. Designing questions on types of linkages in innovation surveys
presents a number of challenges. While all three types of linkages are ofinterest, separate questions on each type  may result in large response burdens
and, given the similarity of the questions, may be very tiresome for
enterprises to answer. The paragraphs below discuss a number of relevantaspects and some options for covering these topics in innovation surveys.
280. Linkages can generate knowledge and technology for any of the four
types of innovations ( i.e.product, process, organisational and marketing
innovations). A large share of the interactions will involve the development of
new products or processes; however linkages may, in many cases, also involve
product design, the development of new marketing techniques, or work on
organisational innovations such as the integration of enterprises with
customers, suppliers or retailers.
281. Questions on linkages can refer to all innovation types combined, to
individual types, or to closely relate d subsets of the four types, such as
product and process innovations.  The ability to identify which type of
innovation a linkage primarily relates to ( e.g.work on individual types of
innovations, or a subset of types such as product and process innovations) can
aid greatly in interpreting the data. For example, linkages involving thedevelopment of a new good or service can differ greatly from linkages
involving the development of new marketing methods.
282. Questions on linkages can use either a binary scale ( i.e.yes/no) or an
ordinal scale and ask enterprises whether they have used the source and, if
so, its importance.  An ordinal scale is useful for identifying the most
important sources (see the discussion of binary and ordinal scales inChapter 8). However, use of an ordina l scale may also limit the options for
designing questions on linkages.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200583283. Some information on acquisition of knowledge and technology can be
obtained from questions on innovation  activities (see Chapter 6), although
these questions do not ask abou t the source of the purchase.
284. In order to detect and better unde rstand the process of clustering or
networking in the field of innovation, additional information can be
obtained by asking for the geographic al location of co -operation partners
(local, national, foreign by region or country).  Information on the geographic
location of sources (domestic or fo reign) may also be useful for open
information sources and acquisition of knowledge and technology.
285. To better interpret results on linkages, questions can be asked about
the enterprise’s status as part of an en terprise group and its position in a value
chain.
2.2.1. Options for designing linkage questions for innovation surveys
286. T ypes of linkages, reference to types of innovation, use of binary orordinal scales and the geographical location of linkages have been identified
as four main factors that innovation surveys can take into consideration indesigning questions on linkages. In order to provide some additional
guidance, three options are outlined below.
287. One option when designing linkage questions for innovation surveys is
to include a combined question that asks whether sources are relevant as
information sources, as sources of pu rchases of knowledge and technology, or
as co-operation partners. This allows for including all three types of linkages
and eliminates repetition. For this option, it is only feasible to utilise a binary
(yes/no) scale. The question could refer either to product and processinnovation or to all innovation types.  However, restricting the question to
product and process innovation (as opposed to all innovation types combined)
would aid when interpreting the data. Supplementary questions could askwhether enterprises have had linkages ( e.g.co-operative partners or
information sources without specifying the specific types) for each type of
innovation. A further question might ask about the geographic location of the
enterprise’s linkages.
288. A second option, which has been used in a number of innovation
surveys, is to include two separate qu estions on linkages, one on information
sources and their relative importance, and one on co-operation partners, their
relative importance and their location. In using this option, it is important to
distinguish between information sour ces and co-operation partners ( e.g.if no
guidelines are given, any co-operation partner will also be considered an open
information source). Advantages of this approach include the possibility of
asking about the relative importance of each source and the geographiclocation of co-operation partners. Draw backs include the fact that acquisition
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200584of knowledge and technology is not covered (aside from the information
gained from questions on innovation ac tivity) and the great deal of repetition
in the two questions. As with the ab ove option, these questions might refer
either to product and process innovation or to all innovation types, and thesame supplementary questions could be asked.
289. A third option would be to include two separate questions on linkages,
one on information sources and one on  co-operation partners, as above.
However, instead of asking about the relative importance of linkages, the
questions could ask (using a binary scale) which types of innovation(s)
(i.e.product, process, organi sational, marketing) each linkage involves. The
main advantage of this option is that it allows for more detailed information
on the type of innovation concerned by each linkage.
2.2.2. Developer of the innovation
290. Additional information can be obtain ed on diffusion by collecting data
on the developer of the enterprise’s innovations. Such questions have been
included in a number of surveys and can give an indication of how active theenterprise has been in developing its innovations, whether it interacted with
other enterprises in their development, or whether the development of the
innovation was primarily conducted outside the enterprise.
291. The information provided is di fferent from that obtained from
questions on the degree of novelty (see Chapter 3), as enterprises may be
developing innovations that already have been implemented by other
enterprises. It thus indicates how in novative enterprises are, though not
necessarily how novel their innovations are.
292. It is recommended to ask questions on the developer of enterprises’
innovations . Enterprises can, for example, be asked for each type of
innovation whether:
●The innovations were mainly developed by the enterprise itself.
●The innovations were developed by th e enterprise in co-operation with
other enterprises or institutions.
●The innovations were mainly developed by other enterprises or institutions.
The last two categories can also be broken down into subcategories, for
example by distinguishing between innovations developed in co-operationwith other firms and in co-operation with public research institutions, or
whether other enterprises are part of the same multinational enterprise or
enterprise group. As with questions on  degree of novelty, questions on the
developer of the innovations can be aske d for all four types of innovations or
for a subset.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005852.3. Other linkage indicators
293. This subsection discusses options for collecting additional data on
linkages that are primarily relevant for specialised surveys.
2.3.1. Types of knowledge and methods of transfer
294. In addition to identifying types of linkages and their sources, it may be
useful to collect more detailed information on important characteristics of
linkages, such as the kinds of knowledge transferred and the method oftransfer. Questions of this type are likely to require a specialised survey that
may be possible to link to the results of general innovation surveys.
Alternatively, supplementary questions can be included in general innovationsurveys, for example on the mo st important external linkage.
2
295. Questions on the kinds of knowledge that are obtained through a
linkage can ask if the knowledge was embodied or disembodied, tacit or
codified, public or private, whether it is R&D-based, specific or generic, and
what its degree of novelty is. Questions on how the actual transfer takes place
can ask about the use of written reports, blueprints, purchases of machinery,components and software, informal contacts, working together, training and
presentations.
2.3.2. Social or network capital
296. Social or network capital refers to enterprises’ stocks of social trust,
values and norms. Thes e have important impacts on the circulation of
information within an enterprise and on sharing knowledge in collaborative
activities with other organisations. Enterprises may implement new
organisational structures or new pr actices to introduce a new business
culture, norms and values, with the objective of improving the enterprise’s
capacity to innovate. The establishment of trust is also a key factor in
maintaining and improving relationships, both within and outside theenterprise. Long-term relationships that can build up mutual trust will likely
be beneficial for all participants.
297. Information can be gain ed on enterprises’ activities to improve social
capital through questions on organisational innovation, e.g.if enterprises
have implemented new practices and routines to introduce a new business
culture and values. Additional inform ation can be gained from specialised
surveys. For example, questions on the duration of an external linkage can
provide an indicator of the level of trust in the relationship. An option is to
include questions on the date of estab lishment of partnerships or strategic
alliances, for example within the last five years, more than five years ago, etc.
Questions on the degree of formalisation of a relationship, such as on the use
of formal contracts, add information on the social and cultural values involved
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200586and on the degree of trust. Further detail s on the role of trust can be gained by
asking how the partner was identified, such as through prior knowledge,
recommendations, or at arm’s length through means such as advertising.
2.3.3 Additional information on innovation co-operation
298. Additional information can be collected about the formalities
regulating co-operation, specific knowle dge delivered in the field of the co-
operation agreement, and more general economic information (such as sector,size and age) about each partner.
299. An additional option is to ask for the number of different partners for
each category. This would make it poss ible to distinguish between large and
small networkers. The number and dura tion of relationships are also of
interest. Ideally this could contribute to  distinguishing the importance of the
different relationships that make up the networks surrounding the firms.
3. Outbound diffusion
300. The value of innovations goes far beyond the impact on the developingfirm itself. It is therefore of interest  to examine the effects and benefits of
innovations for other firms, consumers and the general public. Outbound
diffusion can take place via the sale of a new good or service to consumers or the
sale of a new product or process to anot her firm. However, outbound diffusion is
much broader than this, and can also include the sharing of information and the
diffusion of organisational and marketing innovations. Parts of this process have
been discussed in connection with collaboration, which by definition involvesactive participation – and knowledge or technology transfer – for all partners.
301. While it may be difficult for enterprises to assess the impact of their
innovations outside of their own enterpri se or to track the use of any kinds of
new knowledge, it may be possible to gain information on the users  of a firm’s
innovations. This may be addressed by identifying the main users of their
innovations for the follo wing classifications:
●Consumer markets:
❖Domestic.
❖Foreign.
●Inputs to other firms:
❖Domestic ( inside/outside group ).
❖Foreign ( inside/outside group ).
This information may also be useful for identifying the structure of demand
for the firm’s innovations. The innovati ve activities, strategies and problems
of firms that sell to intermediate us ers such as other firms may differ from
those of firms that sell to final consumers.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005874. Knowledge management
302. Knowledge about the core proces ses, products and markets can be
considered to be what constitutes a firm. Decisions on how to use and
exchange existing knowledge and obtain new knowledge are essential to the
operation of enterprises. Proper systems for managing knowledge can
therefore improve competitiveness and innovative ability.
303. Knowledge management involves activi ties relating to the capture, use
and sharing of knowledge by the organisation. It involves the management
both of external linkages and of kn owledge flows within the enterprise,
including methods and procedures for seeking external knowledge and for
establishing closer relationships with other enterprises (suppliers,
competitors), customers or research inst itutions. In addition to practices for
gaining new knowledge, knowledge management involves methods for
sharing and using knowledge, includ ing establishing value systems for
sharing knowledge and practices for codifying routines.
304. Examples of knowledge management  practices aimed at improving the
internal flow and use of information are:
●Databases of worker “best practices”.
●Regular education or training programmes.
●Informal and formal work teams that promote worker communication and
interaction.
●Integration of activities, which pr omotes interaction among employees
from different areas, for example engineers and production workers.
305. A number of surveys on knowledge management practices have been
conducted in recent years, most notabl y in Canada (see Foray and Gault, 2003;
Earl, 2003) in conjunction with the OECD and international experts. This
survey covered a number of aspects of knowledge management practices,
such as policies and strategies, leader ship, knowledge capture, training and
communications, and reasons for use of knowledge management practicesand the sources that prompted the development of these practices. In
addition, questions on knowledge management have been included in
innovation surveys.
3 Both approaches have had some success in gaining
information on knowledge management practices.
306. As discussed in Chapter 3, organisational innovations may involve the
implementation of significant changes in practices for knowledgemanagement, and some information on knowledge management can be
gained from questions on organisational innovation. However, detailed
examinations of knowledge management activities require specialisedsurveys. This information can then be linked with information from general
innovation surveys.

Measuring Innovation Activities
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005901. Introduction
307. Information on innovation activity is  useful for a number of reasons. It
can provide information on the types of innovation activity enterprises engagein, for example: whether innovative en terprises engage in R&D; whether they
purchase knowledge and technology in the form of extramural R&D,
machinery and equipment, or other external knowledge; whether thedevelopment and implementation of innovations also involves the training of
employees; and whether enterprises are engaged in activities to change part
of their organisation.
308. Innovation activities, including capital purchases, R&D and other
current expenditures related to in novations, can be characterised as
investments in that they may yield retu rns in the future. Su ch returns often go
beyond the specific innovation the acti vity is directed towards. For example,
investments in R&D and innovation-rel ated training are often open-ended in
nature, allowing their a pplication to other tasks.
309. Quantitative measures of expendit ures on each innovation activity
provide an important measure of the level of innovation activity at enterprise,
industry and national levels. These measures may also be used, along withoutput measures, to calculate returns to innovation activities.
310. As the Frascati Manual  states, R&D is only one step in the innovation
process. Innovation involves a number of activities not included in R&D, suchas later phases of development for preproduction, production and
distribution, development activities with a lesser degree of novelty, support
activities such as traini ng and market preparation for product innovations,
and development and implementation activities for new marketing methods
or new organisational methods. In addition, many firms may have innovation
activities that do not involve any R&D.
311. In addition to innovation activities, a number of other factors may
affect the ability to absorb new knowledge and technology and to innovate.
Among them are firms’ knowledge base s, workers’ abil ities and academic
backgrounds, the implemen tation of ICTs, and proximity to public research
institutions and regions with a high density of innovative firms. Identifying
the main factors that allow firms to innovate and the factors that enhance
their ability to innovate is of great importance for policy.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200591312. As outlined in Chapter 2, innovation  is a complex process, and the scale
of activity required for innovation may vary considerably. For example, the in-
house development of a radically different and sophisticated electronic
product for the mass market will involve many more steps than theintroduction of an improved process resulting from technology incorporated
in a pre-programmed machine purchased for the purpose.
313. Innovation activities may be carried  out within the firm or may involve
the acquisition of goods, services or knowledge from outside sources,
including consulting services. A firm may acquire external knowledge and
technology in disembodied or embodied form.
2. The components and coverage of innovation activities
314. As defined in Chapter 3, innovation activities are all those scientific,
technological, organisational, financ ial and commercial steps, including
investment in new knowledge, which actually lead to, or are intended to leadto, the implementation of innovations. These activities may either be
innovative in themselves, or required for the implementation of innovations.
Also included are basic research activities that (by definition) are not directlyrelated to the development of a specific innovation.
315. In order to enable comparability wi th the results of innovation surveys
based on the second edition of the Oslo Manual , all innovation activities other
than R&D are divided between product and process innovation activities on
the one hand, and marketing and organi sational innovations on the other.
316. In order both to maintain continui ty with earlier measures of product
and process innovation activities and to expand coverage to include activities
related to all types of innovations, the followin g conventions are adopted:
●While most R&D is related to product and process innovations, some may
be related to marketing or organisational innovations. Basic research is by
definition not related to any specific innovation. All R&D is included asinnovation activity. Furthermore, R&D is defined as a separate category that
includes relevant activities for product, process, marketing and
organisational innovations, along with basic research.
●All innovation activities other than R&D that are specifically related to
marketing and organisational innovations and not related to a product or
process innovation are incl uded under the categories preparation for
marketing innovations and  preparation for organisational innovations,
respectively. This includes acquisition of other external knowledge or
capital goods and training that is specifically related to marketing or
organisational innovations.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005922.1. Research and experimental development
317. Research and experimental development (R&D) comprises creative work
undertaken on a systematic basis in order to  increase the stock of knowledge, including
knowledge of man, culture and society, and th e use of this stock of knowledge to devise
new applications  (as defined in the Frascati Manual ).
318. All R&D activities financed or perf ormed by enterprises are included as
innovation activities. This includes total intramural and extramural R&D as
defined in the Frascati Manual . It is also worth emphasising the importance of
using the definition and guidelines for R&D of the Frascati Manual  when
collecting data on R&D in innovation su rveys. Therefore, surveys should state
that the definition of R&D is the same as that used in R&D surveys. This will
aid comparison with R&D surveys and facilitate the use of the R&D data
separately.
319. Software development is classified  as R&D if it involves making a
scientific or technological advance and/or resolving scientific/technological
uncertainty on a systematic basis. Servic es development is classified as R&D if
it results in new knowledge or involves the use of new knowledge to devisenew applications.
320. Construction and testing of a prot otype is classified as R&D if the
primary objective is to make further improvements. This is often the mostimportant phase of the experimental development of an innovation. A
prototype is an original model (or test si tuation) that includes all the technical
characteristics and performances of th e new product or process. Acceptance
of a prototype often means that the experimental development phase ends
and the next phase of the innovation process begin (further guidance may befound below and in the Frascati Manual ).
321. Intramural R&D comprises all R&D performed within the enterprise as
defined in the Frascati Manual  and as reported in R&D surveys. It includes both
R&D intended to contribute to the development and implementation of
product, process, marketing or organi sational innovations and basic research
that is not directly related to the de velopment of a specific innovation. Note
that, following the Frascati  definition, intramural R&D also includes the
acquisition of capital goods that is directly related to R&D.
322. Extramural R&D comprises the acquisition of R&D services. It also
includes the acquisition of R&D services from units of multinational
enterprises (MNEs) located abroad.

OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005932.2. Activities for product and process innovations
2.2.1. Acquisition of other external knowledge
323. In addition to R&D, enterprises may acquire technology and know-how
in a number of forms and from a vari ety of sources in connection with the
development and implementation of innovations. This also includesacquisitions from foreign units of MNEs.
324. Acquisition of external knowledge and technology may be in the form
of patents, non-patented inventions, licences, disclosures of know-how,trademarks, designs and patterns.
325. Acquisition of external knowledge may also include computer services
and other scientific and technical serv ices for product and process innovation
activities.
2.2.2. Acquisition of machinery, equipment and other capital goods
326. Innovation activities also involve the acquisition of capital goods, boththose with improved technological performance and those with no
improvement in technological performance that are required for the
implementation of new or improved prod ucts or processes. This category only
includes the acquisition of capital goods for innovation that is not included in
R&D activities. Note that this category  also includes acquisition of capital
goods from foreign units of MNEs (which is not included in R&D).
327. Capital goods for innovations ar e composed of acquisition of land and
buildings,  of machinery, instruments and equipment and, in line with the revised
System of National Accounts – SNA, of computer software , which is a
component of intangible investment and considered as capital formation.
2
328. Land and buildings includes the acquisition of  land and buildings for
product and process innovation activities including major improvements,
modifications and repairs.
329. Machinery, instruments and equipment  includes major instruments and
equipment acquired for use in product an d process innovation activities of the
firm.
330. Computer software , in line with the revised SNA, includes computer
software, programme descriptions and su pporting materials for both systems
and applications software for use in product and process innovation activities
of the firm. The acquisition, development or extension of computer databasesexpected to be used for more than one year in product and process innovation
activities of the firm are also included.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005942.2.3. Other preparations for product and process innovations
331. Enterprises’ development of innova tions may include a number of in-
house activities that are not incl uded in R&D as defined by the Frascati Manual .
They include both the later phases of development activities and, importantly,
the introduction of product and process innovations that are new to the firm,but not new to the market (or, in terms of the definition of R&D, do not
increase the stock of knowledge or cont ain an appreciable element of novelty).
Development and implementation activities for the adoption of new goods,services and processes may represen t an important share of innovation
activity.
332. Other preparations for product and process innovations  includes internal
activities involved in the developmen t and implementation of product and
process innovations that are not includ ed in R&D. They include development
activities that are either partially excl uded as R&D (such as industrial design,
engineering and set-up, and trial producti on) or fully excluded (such as patent
and licence work, production  start-up and testing), and development activities
for product or process innovations that do not meet the novelty requirementfor R&D ( i.e.they are new to the firm but not new to the market). Some of the
elements of this category are described in greater detail below.
333. Other development activities for services include internal activities
involved in the planning and development of new or significantly improved
services that are not included in R&D (see also Frascati Manual , §§ 145-151).
334. Design can include a wide range of activities aimed at planning and
designing procedures, technical specific ations and other user and functional
characteristics for new products and processes. Among them are initial
preparations for the planning of new products or processes, and work on their
design and implementation, including adjustments and further changes. Also
included is industrial design , as defined in the Frascati Manual , which involves
the planning of technical specifications for new products and processes. Some
elements of industrial design should be included as R&D (see Frascati Manual,
§§ 124-125) if they are required for R&D.
335. Testing and evaluation  comprise the testing of  new or significantly
improved products or processes, while testing of prototypes is part of R&D ,
and so is excluded here. For manufacturing, trial production and pilot plantsare included if they are not already included in R&D. Trial production is
included in R&D if production implies full-scale testing and subsequent
further design and engineer ing, while pilot plants are included in R&D if the
primary purpose is R&D. Also included he re are trials and testing activities for
the provision of services, such as tests of how the provision of services
functions with the use of new technologies or trials to examine theperformance of significant improvements in existing services.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200595336. Setup and engineering  concern changes in production and quality control
procedures, methods, standards and asso ciated software required to produce
the new or improved product or to us e the new or improved process. Also
included are changes in procedures an d software required for providing new
services or the use of new delivery methods.
2.2.4. Market preparation for product innovations
337. Market preparation for product innovations  can include preliminary market
research, market tests and launch ad vertising for new or significantly
improved goods and services.
2.2.5. Training
338. Training  is a product or process innovati on activity when it is required
for implementing a product or process innovation, for example so thatproduction workers are able to identify  the desired consistency of a new type
of yoghurt in a food factory, so that a marketing manager understands the
characteristics of an improved braking system on a new model of car in orderto prepare the market launch, or so that  staff are able to use different Linux
programmes after the introduction of a Linux-based PC network in the firm.
This category should exclude training  that is already included in R&D.
339. Training is not a product or process innovation activity when it is not
oriented towards a specific product or  process innovation in the firm. For
example, the following are not innovati on activities: trai ning in existing
production methods for new employees, general upgrading training for
individuals (supervisors, managers, etc .), ongoing computer training, and
language classes. Training for the firs t-time introduction of new marketing
methods or new organisational methods is  part of activities for marketing and
organisational innovations.
2.3. Activities for marketing and organisational innovations
2.3.1. Preparations for marketing innovations
340. Preparation for marketing innovations comprises activities related to
the development and implementation of new marketing methods notpreviously used by the firm. It includes development and planning of new
marketing methods and work involved in their implementation. Activities
related to marketing innovations include only those for developing andimplementing new marketing methods, not expenditures for using these
methods in daily business (such as expe nditures to run advertisements, event
marketing or sponsoring in the course of a newly introduced marketing
method). Note that this category also includes acquisition of other external
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200596knowledge and of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and training
activities that are specifically related to marketing innovations.
341. Preparations for marketing innovations may be related to the
development and implementation of the four types of marketing instruments
typically distinguished in the business world: preparation for the introduction
of new marketing methods in product design or packaging, in pricing
methods, in product placement and in product promotion.
2.3.2. Preparations for organisational innovations
342. Preparation for organisational innovations includes the developmentand planning of new organisational methods and the work involved in theirimplementation. Note that this category  also includes acquisition of other
external knowledge and of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and
training activities that are specifically  related to organisational innovations.
343. Preparation for organisational innovations may be distinguished by
new methods in business practices, in workplace organisation and in
organisation of external relations.
2.4. Design
344. The term product design ,  a s  u s e d  i n  t h e  d e f i n i t i o n  o f  m a r k e t i n g
innovations, refers to the form and appearance of products and not their
technical specifications or other user or functional characteristics. However,
design activities may be understood by enterprises in more general terms, asan integral part of the development an d implementation of product or process
innovations, as described in Section 2.2. 3 of this chapter. The categorisation of
design activities will thus depend on th e type of innovation they are related to.
345. All design activities for the development and im plementation of
product innovations (including work on  form and appearance) and of process
innovations should be included either in R&D  or in other preparations for product
and process innovations .
346. Work related to changes in product design that are marketing
innovations (and not product innovations, i.e.where the functional
characteristics or intended uses of the product in question are not
significantly improved) should be included in Preparations for marketing
innovations .
2.5. The borderline between R&D and non-R&D innovation activities
347. Enterprises may have difficulty differentiating between R&D
expenditure and other innovation activities, especially at the borderline
between R&D and non-R&D activity. Care must be taken to exclude from R&D
any activities that are part of the innovation process but rarely involve any
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200597R&D (e.g. patent work, licensing, market research, manufacturing start-up, process re-
engineering, tooling up) . At the same time, some activities are at least partly
counted as R&D (e.g. pilot plants, prototypes, industrial design, process
development) .
348. Distinguishing R&D and other inno vation activities is particularly
difficult for services (see Frascati Manual,  §§ 145-151), owing in part to the fact
that innovation activities in services tend to be less formally organised, and
that R&D is less well defined for services than for manufacturing.
349. The basic criteria for distinguis hing R&D activities from non-R&D
innovation activities are “the presence  in R&D of an appreciable element of
novelty and the resolution of scientific and/or technological uncertainty” or
that they “result in new knowledge or use of knowledge to devise new
applications” (see Frascati Manual , § 84 and § 146). These criteria imply “that a
particular project may be R&D if undert aken for one reason, but not if carried
out for another” ( Frascati Manual,  § 85). It is recommen ded that the guidelines
in the Frascati Manual , §§ 110-130 and §§ 145-151, should be applied to
innovation surveys.
2.6. The development and use of software in innovation activities
350. The development, acquisition, adap tation and use of software pervade
innovation activities. Developing new or substantially improved software,
either as a commercial product or for use as an in-house process (an
innovation in its own right), involves research and experimental development
and a range of post-R&D activities. In addition, all types of innovations may
involve the acquisition and adaptation of software; the software is not an
innovation in itself but is required for the development and implementation of
innovations.
3. Collecting data on innovation activities
351. Summarising the section above, innovation activities can be broken
down as follows:
Research and experimental development
Intramural (in-house) R&D: Creative work undertaken on a systematic basis
within the enterprise in order to increa se the stock of knowledge and use it to
devise new applications. Th is comprises all R&D conducted by the enterprise,
including basic research.
Acquisition of extramural R&D: Same activities as intramural R&D, but
purchased from public or private research organisations or from other
enterprises (including other en terprises within the group).
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200598Activities for product and process innovations
Acquisition of other external knowledge:  Acquisition of rights to use patents
and non-patented inventions, trademarks, know-how and other types of
knowledge from other enterprises and in stitutions such as universities and
government research institutions, other than R&D.
Acquisition of machinery, equipment and other capital goods:  Acquisition of
advanced machinery, equi pment, comput er hardware or software, and land
and buildings (including major improvements, modifications and repairs),
that are required to implement product or process innovations. Acquisition
of capital goods that is included in intramural R&D activities is excluded.
Other preparations for product and process innovations : Other activities
related to the development and implementation of product and process
innovations, such as design, planning  and testing for new products (goods
and services), production processes, and delivery methods that are not
already included in R&D.
Market preparations for product innovations:  Activities aimed at the market
introduction of new or significan tly improved goods or services.
Training:  Training (including external training) linked to the development of
product or process innovations and their implementation.
Activities for marketing and organisational innovations
●Preparations for marketing innovations:  Activities related to the
development and implementation of  new marketing methods. Includes
acquisition of other external knowle dge and other capital goods that is
specifically related to marketing innovations.
●Preparations for organisational innovations:  Activities undertaken for the
planning and implementation of new organisation methods. Includes
acquisition of other external knowle dge and other capital goods that is
specifically related to organisational innovations.
352. Total expenditure for innovation activities comprises current and
capital expenditure incurred for the innovation activities defined above.
Current innovation expenditures are composed of labour costs and othercurrent costs. Capital expenditures fo r innovations are composed of gross
expenditures on land and buildings, on instruments and equipment and on
computer software. Capital expenditures that are part of R&D are included in
intramural R&D , while non-R&D capital expenditures linked to product and
process innovations are included in acquisition of machinery, equipment and other
capital goods.  Non-R&D capital expenditures specifically linked to marketing or
organisational innovations are included in preparations for marketing innovations
and preparations for organisational innovations , respectively. The remaining
categories of innovation activity co nsist solely of current expenditure.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 200599353. Innovation surveys can collect both  qualitative and quantitative data
on innovation activities. Qualitative data  involves questions on whether or not
enterprises have engaged in an innovation activity. Quantitative data involve
questions on expenditures for an innovation activity.
354. Innovation expenditure data are among the most important and are in
demand both for research and policy. However, innovation expenditure
questions are also among the most diff icult and time-consuming to answer.
Innovation surveys may consider limiting the number of categories of
innovation activities for quantitative questions.
355. Difficulty in reporting innovation  expenditure raises two issues that
innovation surveys may consider when  designing quantitative questions on
innovation activities. The first is the re sponse burden. While activities such as
R&D may be confined to one department , innovation activi ty may take place
throughout the enterprise. In addition, expenditures on a number of activities
may not be directly available from enterprises’ accounting systems.
Expenditure questions are thus likely to be the most time-consuming toanswer, and detailed questions on expe nditure may therefore have an impact
on unit and item response rates. This is of particular concern for non-
mandatory surveys.
356. A second, related issue is the qualit y of the data. Data quality is likely
to be best for expenditures that can be  extracted from accounting information;
other expenditures may be rough estima tes, if given at all. Questionnaire
design, the number of expenditure categories and wording may be very
important for the quality of the data collected on innovation expenditure.
3.1. Qualitative data on innovation activity
357. I t  i s  r e commend ed tha t q ua l i ta ti v e  da ta  b e  col le ct ed on i nno v a ti o n
activities. Questions on whether or not firms have engaged in the aboveactivities can either refer to a single year or the entire observation period.
Surveys may wish to collect qualitative data on all categories of innovation
activities or on a subset of these. Th e multi-year approach has the advantage
of capturing innovation activity for enterprises that may not perform
innovation activity on a regular basis.
358. Additional information can also be collected on individual types of
innovation activities. Examples are wh ether R&D activity is continuous or
occasional, which types of external kn owledge the enterprise has acquired, or
a separate question on software expenditures.
3.1.1. Other qualitative indicators of innovation activity
359. Information on employee characteristics, such as the level of educationand number of technical staff, can also be collected in innovation surveys. For
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005100example, the share of employees with a higher education certificate or degree
(ISCED 5-6) and the share of personnel in volved in innovation or R&D activity
can be used as supplementary measures of the innovation capability of the
firm’s knowledge stock and employees. Furthermore, most enterprises arelikely to possess information on thei r employees’ level of education. An
additional qualitative indicator is whether enterprises participate in national
or supranational programmes that provide financial support for employeeeducation/training or for the employment of research personnel.
3.2. Quantitative data on innovation activity
360. For the collection of quantitative data on innovation expenditures, it
is recommended that a breakdown by type of activity should be used
(see Section 3 of this chapter). Surveys may wish to collect quantitative data
on all categories of innovation activiti es or, as innovation expenditures are
difficult to measure, surveys may opt to  collect data on a subset of these.
361. Innovation expenditure can also be broken down by type of
expenditure (current innovation ex penditure vs. capi tal expenditures
for innovations) and by source of funds. These are discussed in
Sections 3.4 and 3.5.
362. While collecting data on innovation  activities for a multi-year period
may be feasible for qualitative question s on innovation activities, restricted
availability of data within firms is  a serious obstacle to the multi-year
approach for quantitative data. Therefore, it is recommended that
quantitative questions on innovation expenditure refer only to the last year
of the observation period, the reference year.
363. Concerning capital purchases, expenditures for the category,
acquisition of machinery, equipment and other capital goods,  should exclude
purchases of capital goods th at are already included in intramural R&D.
Purchases of capital goods should be included in full for the period in which
they took place. All depreciation prov isions for building, plant and equipment,
whether real or imputed, should be  excluded from the measurement of
intramural expenditure.
364. Enterprises often face severe proble ms for supplying reliable estimates
of capital expenditure for innovation activities. To assist them, data on total
capital expenditure  (including capital expendit ure not related to innovation
activities) can be collected as well. This will help in checking the reliability of
innovation expenditure data.
365. Some innovations span more than one type of innovation. An example
is the implementation of  a marketing innovation that is connected to a
product innovation. In order to avoid double counting, innovation surveys
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005101should ensure that innovation expend itures are included in no more than
one category of innovation activities.
3.3. Other measurement issues
3.3.1. Intramural and extramural expenditure
366. While most innovation activities are separated according to intramural
and extramural expenditures, full separation may not be feasible for most
enterprises and is not recommended.
367. The inclusion of extramural expenditures is important at the micro
level for measuring expenditures for individual enterprises. However, special
care must be taken when aggregating  individual enterprise amounts to
industry or national figures, because of double counting.  Double counting is
most likely to occur for extramural R&D and acquisition of other external
knowledge.
3.4. Breakdown by type of expenditure
368. Expenditure for innovation activities may also be broken down intocurrent and capital expenditure. This can be useful if the data are to becompared with those on intangible investment, with which innovation
expenditure is sometimes confused (see Section 3.4.1 below). Among the
categories of innovation activities, ca pital expenditures for innovation are
included in intramural R&D , acquisition of machinery, equipment and other capital
goods, and potentially also in  preparations for marketing innovations  and
preparation for organisational innovations . All other categories consist solely of
current expenditures. Thus, it may be  possible to obtain a breakdown of
innovation expenditure by type of expend iture by asking enterprises to specify
R&D , preparations for marketing innovations  and preparations for organisational
innovations according to current and capital expenditures. However, given that
this would increase response burdens and that R&D expenditure is collectedin considerable detail through other surveys in most countries, this
breakdown is not recommended for general innovation surveys.
369. Current innovation expenditures  are composed of labour costs  and
other current costs:
●Labour costs  comprise annual wages and sala ries and all associated costs of
fringe benefits such as bonus payments, holiday pay, contributions topension funds and other social security payments and payroll taxes. The
labour costs of persons not involved in innovation activities (such as
security personnel and maintenance st aff) should be excluded here and
included under other current costs.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005102●Other current costs comprise non-capital purcha ses of materials, supplies,
services and equipment to support inno vation activities performed by the
firm in a given year.
370. Capital expenditures for innovations  are defined above.
3.4.1. The relation between intangible investment and innovation 
expenditure
371. Intangible investment  covers all non-capital expenditure for the firm’s
development which is expected to give a return over a longer period than theyear in which it is incurred. It is generally taken to cover expenditure on non-
routine marketing, training, software  and some other similar items, in
addition to current expenditure on R&D.
372. Current expenditure on innovation  is clearly a part of intangible
investment, but intangible investment comprises elements which are not part
of current innovation expenditure. For example, only training in connectionwith the introduction of innovations is  classified as innovation expenditure,
whereas intangible investment includes all of the firm’s training expenditure.
Marketing in connection with the in troduction of new products or the
development and implementation of ne w marketing methods is classified as
innovation expenditure. Intangible investment, on the other hand, includes all
marketing expenditure in general.
373. At the same time, innovation expenditure includes tangible investment
such as capital expenditure on R&D, and the acquisition of new machinery
and equipment related to innovations.
3.5. Breakdown by source of funds
374. It is important to know how inno vation expenditure is financed, for
instance in order to evaluate the role of public policy and internationalisation
in the innovation process. The following classification by source of funds  can
be used:
●Own funds.
●Funds from related companies (subsi diary or associated companies).
●Funds from other (non-financial) enterprises.
●Funds from financial companies (bank loans, venture capital, etc.).
●Funds from government (loans, grants, etc.).
●Funds from supranational and international organisations (EU, etc.).
●Other sources.
In addition, external sources of funds can be broken down into domestic and
international sources of funds.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005103375. Where survey designers wish to cover these topics, it may be enough,
for a variety of policy and research issues, to collect information on whether
or not each source is used, instead of seeking an estimate, probably imprecise,
of the amount (either in monetary or percentage terms) contributed by eachsource. This will considerably reduce the response burden on firms, and hence
increase the total survey response ra te and cut item non-response to this
question. Owing to concerns regarding response burdens for generalinnovations surveys, the Manual makes no recommendation on the extent of
coverage of sources of funds.
376. To evaluate the role of gove rnment procurement in innovation
processes, it is useful to know whether or not a firm participates in
government procurement of innovative products and processes at regional,
national or international levels.
3.6. The subject approach versus  the object approach
377. Survey questions on innovation expenditure may be formulated in two
ways:
●Total expenditure on innovation activities for the firm in a given year or
period (= the subject approach ).
●Total expenditure for specific innovations implemented in a given year or
during a given period regardless of the year in which the expenditure occurs
(=the object approach ).
378. There is a fundamental difference  between the two approaches and
they lead to different results. Since both have been used in innovation surveys,
it seems worthwhile to clarif y the relation between them.
379. The  subject approach  covers expenditure for implemented, potential
and abandoned innovation activities as de fined above. In this respect, it is a
straightforward extension of traditional R&D measurement.
380. In the object approach  the sum reported comprises total expenditure
on defined innovations, or on the main  innovation(s), im plemented during a
given period. It excludes expenditure on innovation projects that have beenabandoned or are in progress, and on general R&D not connected to a specific
application. This approach seems particularly suitable for innovation surveys
starting from a set of identified inno vations, but it could also be used in
surveys of the innovation activi ties of enterprises in general.
381. In light of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, the
subject approach is recommended for reporting on innovation expenditure.The Manual’s guidelines are therefor e oriented to the subject approach.

Objectives, Obstacles and Outcomes 
of Innovation
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051061. Introduction
382. This chapter discusses incentives  for and obstacles to engaging in
innovation activity and the impact of innovation. Identifying the factors thatdrive innovation and those that hinder it is of great value for understanding
the innovation process and for formulating innovation policy. Interest in
measuring innovation is due to its rela tion to the performance of enterprises,
industries and the economy as a whole. Measures of the impact of innovation
on enterprise performance are thus among the most important innovation
indicators, but they are also among the most difficult to obtain.
383. The impact of innovations on enterprise performance range from
effects on turnover and market share to changes in productivity and
efficiency. Among the significant impacts at industry and national levels arechanges in international competitivenes s and in total factor productivity,
knowledge spillovers of firm-level inno vations, and an increase in the amount
of knowledge flowing through networks.
384. Objectives and barriers vary by type of innovation. For example, the
objectives of product or marketing innovations will primarily relate to
demand ( e.g.improving product quality, incr easing market share, entering
new markets), while process or organisa tional innovations will tend to relate
to supply ( e.g.reducing costs, improving production capabilities). Some
barriers relate to all types of innovation ( e.g.cost factors) while others relate to
a subset of innovation types.
385. This chapter describes a number of indicators for innovation surveys
and discusses other measures which, while relevant, may be difficult toinclude in general innovation surveys but may be included in specialised
surveys. Surveys can choose to address questions on objectives, barriers and
other indicators to all types of innovations, to subsets such as product andprocess innovations, or to  individual types of innovation. This chapter is
designed to provide guidelines for all these approaches.
2. Objectives and effects of innovations
386. Enterprises may engage in innovation  activity for a number of reasons.
Their objectives  may relate to products, markets, efficiency, quality or the
ability to learn and to implement change s. Identifying enterprises’ motives for
innovating and their importance is helpful when examining the forces that
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005107drive innovation activity, such as competition and opportunities for entering
new markets. Data on objectives can also provide additional information on
the characteristics of types of innovations.
387. Enterprises may or may not succeed in achieving their objectives by
implementing innovations, or innovations may have other or additional
effects than those that initially mo tivated their implementation. While
objectives  concern enterprises’ motives for innovating, effects  concern the
actual observed outcomes of innovation s. The same factors may play a role in
both objectives and effects of innovation, although they will be interpreted
differently. Table 7.1 lists factors that ar e relevant to objectives and effects for
all four types of innovations. A number of the factors may be relevant for more
than one type of innovation. In particular, product and marketing innovations
or process and organisational innovations may have a number of factors incommon.
388. The factors listed aim to shed li ght on a number of forces driving
enterprises’ innovation activity. Competition, demand and markets  concern the
main incentives for product innovations and in some cases for marketing
innovations. The intent of questions on these factors is to determine the
importance of the motives for product in novations, such as: short product life
spans that necessitate the development of new products; the need to diversify
product portfolios; or efforts to increa se or avoid a decline in market share.
389. In addition, a number of factors ai m to identify the main motives for
changes in production and delivery , i.e.whether their main intent is to improve
quality, flexibility or efficiency/cost redu ction. In particular, factors relating to
cost reduction are made specific to en able better interpretation of results.
Factors concerning workplace organisation  identify the main forces behind
organisational change: whether they ar e oriented towards customer relations,
operational efficiency or  improving the capture and sharing of knowledge.
390. It is  recommended to collect data on the objectives or effects of
innovations implemented by enterprises during the period under review. It
is recommended to use an ordinal scale to ask enterprises whether thefactor is relevant and, if so, its importance . Questions on both the objectives
of innovation and their actual effect s can provide valuable information on
enterprises’ innovation activity. Howeve r, it may not be possible to include
both questions in innovation surveys.  The choice between the two questions
may depend on which is considered most useful for policy. However, a
drawback of questions on effects is that  the impact of recent innovations may
not be felt within the time  period of the survey. The disadvantage of questions
on objectives is that the actual effects may differ substantially from
expectations.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005108391. Questions on objectives or effect s may either refer to all types of
innovations or to a subset of these, such as product and process innovations.Limiting the types of innovations these questions refer to can facilitate
interpretation of the data (given that most factors are relevant for at least two
types, for example product and marketing innovations or process andorganisational innovations). An addition al option is to include questions for
each innovation type (or su bsets of types) separately.Table 7.1. Factors relating to the objectives and effects of innovation

 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051093. Other measures of impacts on enterprise performance
392. This section considers output indicators in addition to those discussed
in Section 2, in particular quantitative  indicators of innovation performance.
393. The success of an innovation may depend on a number of factors. It will
clearly depend on the quality of the innovation. The impact of innovations
may also vary greatly from sector to sector or region to region. In addition, itmay depend on other changes in the enterprise that support the innovations.
For example, the success of product innovations may depend to a large degree
on marketing initiatives to launch the pr oduct. Likewise, the impact of process
innovations may depend on organisational changes to take advantage of these
new processes. A well-documented example is the importance of
organisational changes for the impact of investments in information andcommunication technology (ICT) on productivity (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000;
OECD, 2004).
394. It is generally difficult to ask for quantitative measures of the effects of
innovations in surveys, even for very  rough estimates, as the calculations
often require substantial analysis on the part of the enterprise. This section
discusses some output indicators that might be used in innovation surveys.
395. An important aspect for all analyses of the impact of innovations is the
time lag between an innovation and its impact. Some effects may materialise
over the course of the observation period, while others may take longer. The
availability of innovation data on  a large cross-section over time ( i.e.panel
data) is of great value for such analyses . Panel surveys can open up interesting
possibilities for analysing the results of innovation.
396. To help create a view of how innovation affects overall performance,
some general data on the enterprise can be collected for the beginning and
end of the observation period, such as  data on turnover, exports, employees
and operating margins. These data can be used in subsequent analysis to
examine the effect of various indicato rs on these variables. Data can be
collected via the innovation survey or  taken from other available sources.
3.1. Impact on turnover
3.1.1. Proportion of turnover due to new or significantly improved 
products
397. An indicator on the proportion of turnover due to new or significantly
improved products provides important information on the impact of product
innovations on the overall makeup of turnover ( i.e.the share of turnover from
new products) and on the degree of innovativeness of the enterprise.
398. Questions on the proportion of tu rnover due to product innovations
should refer to the impact of product innovation over the observation period
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005110on turnover in the reference year ( i.e.the last year of the observation period).
It is recommended to ask enterprises to estimate the percentage share of
total turnover in the reference year that is due to:
●New or significantly improved goods and services introduced during the
observation period that were new to the market (as defined in Chapter 3).
●New and significantly improved goods and services introduced during the
observation period that were new to the firm,  though not new to the
market.
●Products that were unchanged or only marginally modified  during the
observation period.
399. A number of firms may have come into existence during the period
under review. This includes both newly established firms and firms that are
the result of mergers, demergers and other kinds of reorganisation. Thesefirms should be treated like all other firms when constructing this indicator.
400. Respondents should supply their be st estimates of actual percentages.
When presenting the results by industry, firm size, region or country, thepercentages should be calculated as the ratio of total turnover due to new
products to total turnover for the industry, etc.
Product life cycles401. Outcome indicators are directly affected by the length of product life
cycles. They are likely to be higher in product groups with short life cycles and
innovation is expected to take place more frequently.
402. In order to take the effects of product life cycles into account, an option
is to ask enterprises to estimate the average length of their products’ life
cycles. This information may be used to weight the outcome indicators for
turnover shares. An alternative way of formulating this question is to ask how
often the enterprise generally introduces innovations.
3.1.2. Process innovations
403. Innovation surveys can also ask enterprises to estimate the percentage
of turnover that is affected by pr ocess innovations. This can provide an
indication of how extensive process innovations are in terms of the
enterprise’s total operations.
3.1.3. Marketing innovations
404. The development and implementa tion of marketing innovations
constitutes an important innovation acti vity for many enterprises in terms of
impact on performance. To gain an  idea of the scope of marketing
innovations, enterprises might be asked to estimate the percentage of total
turnover that is affected by marketing innovations. Innovation surveys can
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005111ask two separate questions concerning marketing innovations. One asks for
an estimate of the percentage of tu rnover due to goods and services with
significant improvements in product design or packaging. The second asks for
an estimate of the share of turnover  affected by new marketing methods in
pricing, promotion or placement. Note th at questions on share of turnover due
to changes in product design should no t be combined with questions on share
of turnover due to product innovations ( i.e.these two questions should be
separate), since some new or improved  products might be both product and
marketing innovations. Nor should questions on new marketing methods in
product design be combined with ques tions on the share of turnover due to
other new marketing methods. As wi th other questions concerning the
impact on turnover, enterprises will lik ely only be able to provide rough
estimates at best.
3.2. The impact of process innovations on costs and employment
405. As described in Section 2, innovation surveys can include questions onthe effects of innovations and their relative importance. An option forobtaining additional information on pr ocess innovations is through questions
on their impacts on costs or employment.
406. There are a number of options for asking questions on the impact of
process innovations on costs. Enterprises can be asked first, whether process
innovations implemented during the obse rvation period led to an increase,
decrease or no change in costs. A “yes” response to a decrease or increase can
be followed by further questions to quantify the amount of change.
407. These questions can either be asked with respect to average costs or to
specific costs, for example changes in the cost of material, energy or labour
inputs. Quantitative questions can either  ask for an interval estimate of the
percentage change in costs, or ask enterprises to choose from a set of pre-defined categories ( e.g.an increase or decrease of less than 5%, 5% to 25%, over
25%). Experience from earlier surveys indicates that enterprises find the latter
method easier to answer and thus result s in much higher item response rates.
The same techniques can also be used to ask about the effect of process
innovations on employment, i.e.whether employment increased or
decreased, and by how much.
408. This approach can also be used for organisational innovations. In this
case, questions should be asked with respect to average costs as opposed to
specific costs.
3.3. The impact of innovation on productivity
409. Concerning impacts on productivity, a number of questions are of greatinterest, for example whether process inno vations or organisa tional innovations
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005112improve efficiency. A detailed examination of these issues would require separate
analyses using both innovation data and other economic data on firm
performance. In many cases, panel da ta on innovation would be necessary,
though some analysis can be performed using innovation data from a singlesurvey combined with economic data for more than one year . An example is
empirical analyses of ICT investments and organisational innovation, which
generally have found that the effects of ICT investments on productivity dependgreatly on organisational innova tions (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000).
4. Factors hampering innovation activities
410. Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be
reasons for not starting innovation activities at all, or factors that slow innovationactivity or have a negative effect on expected results. These include economic
factors, such as high costs or lack of demand, enterprise factors, such as a lack of
skilled personnel or knowledge, and legal fa ctors, such as regu lations or tax rules.
411. Questions on barriers to innovation can provide information on a number
of issues relevant for innovation policy. Small and medium sized enterprises
(SMEs) may identify a lack of availa ble finance as an important barrier to
investments in innovation. Enterprises ma y be concerned about a lack of demand
for new products at the prices that enterprises would need to charge to make the
innovation worthwhile. Enterprises may not have the skilled personnel needed toengage in innovation activities, or th eir innovation activities may be slowed
because they are unable to find the nece ssary personnel on the labour market. A
lack of infrastructure may be an important barrier to innovation, in particular
outside of large cities. Other reasons may be that the enterprise lacks knowledge
relating to technologies or markets that would be needed to develop aninnovation, or that the enterprise is unable to find suitable partners for joint
innovation projects. Table 7.2 lists factors that could act as barriers to innovation.
412. These barriers can be related to a spec ific type of innovation or to all types.
For example, cost factors can be relevant  for all types of innovations, and market
factors can affect both the development of product innovations and work on
product design ( i.e. marketing innovations). The ta ble also shows which types of
innovations are relevant for each barrier.
413. It is recommended to collect data on barriers to innovation activity and
their relative importance for the period under review. Questions on barriers toinnovation activity should be asked of both innovative and non-innovative
enterprises.  Questions on barriers can refer to all types of innovations or to a
subset of types, such as pr oduct and process innovations.

OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051145. Questions on the appropriability of innovations
414. The ability of enterprises to approp riate the gains from their innovation
activities is an important factor affecting innovation. If, for example,enterprises are unable to protect th eir innovations from imitations by
competitors, they will have less incentive to innovate. On the other hand, if an
industry functions well without formal  protection methods, promoting these
may slow the flow of knowledge and technology and lead to higher prices for
goods and services.
415. Policy plays a central role in the design of legal methods of protecting
innovations. Data on which types of methods are used and their relative
importance can help inform policies to maximise the economic and social
benefits from intellec tual property rights.
416. The following list of methods of protection is suggested:
Formal methods:
●Patents.
●Registration of design.
●Trademarks.
●Copyrights.
●Confidentiality agreements and trade secrecy.
Informal methods:
●Secrecy that is not covered by legal agreements.
●Complexity of product design.
●Lead time advantage over competitors.
An additional formal method that is us ed in some countries is petty patents or
utility patents, which are rights for protection of inventions that are granted
without any formal review.
417. Patent data, both applications and grants, function as an intermediate
output indicator for innovation activity and also provide information on the
innovative capabilities of the enterprise . For example, an enterprise that has
applied for patents can be assumed to be capable of developing innovations
that are new to the world (occasionall y only new to the market, depending on
the patent strategies of other firms). Data on whether or not enterprises haveapplied for or been granted a patent can thus provide useful data for
innovation surveys and be used in specialised surveys on intellectual property
rights (IPR). Note that patent data sh ould refer to the country where the patent
was developed and not the country where the patent application was made.
Patent data is discussed in greater detail in the Patent Manual  (OECD, 1994).

design of products, to prevent other en terprises from using it. Enterprises may
also register trademarks related to the enterprise as a whole or a product line,
thereby protecting the enterprise’s imag e and the association of products with
the enterprise. Copyrights relate to the final use of some types of products and
establish rights to claim payment for th e use of copyright-protected products.
419. Patents are methods for protecting research and development results.
Confidentiality agreements between en terprises and other organisations are
also designed to protect R&D work, while at the same time allowing the
enterprise to interact with other organisations on this work.
420. It is recommended to collect data on whether or not enterprises have
used various methods of protection for their innovations during the
observation period . Questions can either use a binary or an ordinal scale.
Protection methods can be relevant for all types of innovations, though asking
questions for all innovation types comb ined can make it more difficult to
interpret the data ( i.e.to link protection meth ods to specific types of
innovations).
421. Among the options for questions on methods of protection are:
●Refer to product and process innova tion only. A supplementary question
could be asked on marketing and organisational innovations ( e.g.whether
any formal methods of protection we re used for these innovations). An
ordinal scale can be used to ask about the relative importance of different
methods.
●Refer to all types of innovations comb ined. An ordinal scale could be used.
●Refer to each individual innovation type, allowing enterprises to choose
those innovations that are relevant for each protection method. This would
allow the greatest level of detail on the use of protection methods, such as
which formal methods are used for ma rketing methods, which innovations
patents are used for, and whether se crecy or other methods are used for
organisational or other innovations.

Survey Procedures
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051181. Introduction
422. The correct application of statisti cal methodology is crucial for the
collection and analysis of innovation data. Based on theoretical knowledgeand on practical experience in recent innovation surveys at national and
international levels, this chapter discusses and provides guidelines on central
elements of the collection and analysis of innovation data.
423. Following these guidelines will generally lead to comparable results
over time and across countries. Particular circumstances may require a
country to use another methodology. In such cases, the methods used shouldbe considered carefully so as to ensu re that the results remain comparable.
Divergence from the guidelines should be documented in sufficient detail to
explain comparability issues with data from other countries.
2. Populations
2.1. The target population
424. Innovation activities take plac e in all parts of an economy: in
manufacturing, the service industries , public administrations, the health
sector and even private households. In  reality, for various theoretical and
practical reasons, a survey will not cover all possible units. The concept of
innovation may be less clear in some pa rts of the economy, especially for non-
market-oriented activities.
425. As discussed in Chapter 1, it is therefore recommended that innovation
surveys should refer to innovation activi ties in the business enterprise sector.
Hence, the target population for innovation surveys concerns statistical units
(innovators and non-innovators, R&D performers and non-R&D performers) in
the business enterprise sector. This se ctor includes both goods-producing and
services industries. A proposed list of industrial classifications to be included
in the target population for innovation surveys is shown in Chapter 4.
426. Innovative activities take place in small and medium-sized units as
well as in large units. In order to capt ure innovation activity in these smaller
units, it is recommended that the target population should include, at a
minimum, all statistical units with at least ten employees.  This threshold
may be higher for specific industries, such as Construction and Retail trade.
Surveys may also find it useful to include units with fewer  than ten employees.
Innovation activities in these smaller units are of considerable policy interest
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005119for a number of sectors, such as high-technology manufacturing and
knowledge-intensive services.
2.2. The frame population
427. The units from which a survey sample or census is drawn form theframe population . When preparing a survey, the target and frame populations
should be as close as possible. In pr actice, the population from which the
sample or census is drawn may not be the same as the target population. Forexample, the frame population underlying the survey (such as a register) may
include units that no longer exist, or units that no longer belong to the target
population. At the same time, it may not contain units that in fact do belongto the target population.
428. The frame population is based on the last year of the observation
period for surveys. Special attention shou ld be paid to a number of changes to
units that may have taken place during  the observation pe riod. Among these
are: changes in industrial classification s, new units created during the period,
mergers, splits of un its, and units that ceased activities during the last year of
the period.
429. An ideal frame is an up-to-date offi cial business register established for
statistical purposes. National statistical offices usually keep such registers.Other registers can be used as well, provided their quality is comparable to
that of the official register. The units in the register will in many countries be
legal units, so the units may not all be statistical units in terms of the
innovation survey, as defined in Chapter 4. Guidelines to check the validity of
the responding statistical unit should be given in the questionnaire.
430. If the register forms the basis for several surveys, such as the
innovation survey, the R&D survey and the general business statistics survey,
the information collected in the innovation survey can be restricted to issuesspecific to innovation. Other information, for example on R&D or on general
economic variables such as employment, turnover, exports or investments,
can be taken directly from the other surveys based on the register.Accordingly, it is desirable to base different types of surveys on a single
business register compiled for statistical purposes.
3. Survey methods
3.1. Mandatory or voluntary survey
431. Innovation surveys can be either ma ndatory or voluntary. If they are
voluntary, higher non-response rates should be expected. Low response rates
mean a smaller sample than expected and thus higher variance. This can be
compensated to some extent, in the case of sample surveys, by higher
sampling fractions. However, increasing  the sampling fractions does not solve
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005120the basic problem of bias in the estimates for the target population that is due
to a high non-response rate, making further analyses less representative.
3.2. Census or sample survey
432. Innovation data can be collected through census or sample surveys.
Resource limitations and response bu rdens will in most cases rule out a
survey of the entire population (census). If sample surveys are utilised, the
units should be selected on the basi s of a random procedure (random sample
surveys with known selection probabilities). Sample surveys should be
representative of the basic characterist ics of the target population, such as
industry, size and region, so a stratified sample is necessary.
433. A census may be unavoidable in some cases. It may be a legal
requirement that all business surveys must  be censuses. In addition, when the
frame population is fairly small ( e.g.in small countries), proper sampling may
produce sample sizes for some strata that  are relatively close in size to the
frame population of the strata. In such cases censuses may be worth
considering. Finally, it may be decided that all units in the frame with morethan a given number of employees should be included.
434. For sample surveys, the sample of enterprises should be large enough
to give reliable results for the units in the target population and characteristicsof interest in the target population, such as specific sectors. Estimates of
acceptable coefficients of variation can be used to estimate the required
number of responses for reliable results.  The total sampling fraction will vary
depending on the size of the total frame population, while the sampling
fractions of each stratum will depend on the number of units, the size of theunits and the variability of the main indicators. In general, the necessary
sample fraction will decrease with the number of units in the population and
increase with the size of the units and the variability of the sample.
3.3. Domains
435. Particular subsets of the target popu lation may be of special interest to
users or users may need detailed inform ation at sector or regional levels.
These subsets are called domains (or sub-populations). To get representative
results for the domains, the domains must  be subsets of the sampling strata.
The most frequent approach is “over-allocation” in order to produce reliableresults for the domains. Additionally, establishing domains may allow for the
co-ordination of different business enterprise surveys, as well as for
comparisons over time between enterpri ses with similar ch aracteristics. Some
potential sub-populations that can be co nsidered are: industry groupings, size
classes, regions, units that engage in R&D and innovation-active units.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005121436. Some guidelines for the use of domains are:
●Statistical units and classifications should be the same in all parts of the
sample including domains.
●Methods used ( e.g.weighting methods) to calc ulate results for subsets
should be consistent with those used for results from the main sample.
●Deviations in data treatment or differ ences in the quality of the results from
the domains should be documented.
3.4. Sampling techniques
437. Innovation surveys are in general random sample surveys. The relevantliterature offers various sampling tech niques, such as the simple random
sample technique, stratification tec hniques, cluster sample techniques and
pps-sample
1 techniques. The techniques may even be combined. In the past,
stratified sample surveys have proved to lead to reliable results.
438. If stratification techniques are used, some general rules should be
observed with regard to the selectio n of the stratification variables. In
principle, stratification of the populati on should lead to strata that are as
homogeneous as possible in terms of their innovation or non-innovation
activities. Given that the innovation acti vities of units in different industries
and in different size classes ca n differ significantly, it is recommended that
the stratification of random sample innovation surveys should be based on
the size and principal activity of the units.
439. The size of units should be measured by number of employees.
Recommended size classes are provided in Chapter 4. Some
recommendations for analytical purposes, which might also be used forstratification, are given below.
440. The stratification of units accordin g to their principal activities should
be based on the ISIC Rev. 3.1/NACE Rev. 1.1 classifications. The classification
level largely depends on national circumstances. Take as an example an
economy specialised in the production of wood (Division 20 of ISIC Rev. 3.1/
NACE Rev. 1.1). For this country a further subdivision at group or even classlevel might be useful, but would not be useful in another economy in which
wood production is unimportant. However, sampling strata should not be
aggregated above the division level (second-digit level of ISIC Rev. 3.1/NACE Rev. 1.1).
441. If regional aspects are of import ance, the stratification should also
include a regional dimension. An approp riate regional classification should be
used. See the discussion of regional analyses in Chapter 4.
442. Sampling fractions should not be the same for all strata. It is generally
recommended that the sampling fraction  of a stratum should be higher for
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005122more heterogeneous strata (optimal allocation), and also higher for smaller
strata. The sampling fractions should be up to 100% in strata with only a few
units, as may be the case in strata consisting of large units in certain
industries (or certain regions). The size of the units should also be taken into
consideration by using the pps-samp ling approach and thus using lower
sampling fractions in strata with smalle r units. Also, the units in each stratum
may be sorted by size or turnover an d then sampled systematically. Another
factor, which should be taken into account when fixing the individual
sampling fractions, is the expected  response rate in each stratum.
3.5. Panel data surveys
443. The standard approach for innovation surveys is repeated cross-sections ,
where a new random sample is drawn from a given population for each
innovation survey. An alternative or supplementary approach is to impose anexplicit panel data structure, whereby a given sample of units is surveyed more
frequently and in every subsequent su rvey using the same set of questions.
444. Panel data provide the opportunity to follow the development over time
of the innovation process at the microeconomic level. In particular, it allows
for the analysis of effects of variou s innovation indicators over time on
economic variables such as sales, productivity, exports and employees.
445. Panel data surveys can be conduc ted in parallel to larger cross-
sectional innovation surveys. However, a number of guidelines should be
followed:
●Units should be integrated with full-s cale cross-sectional surveys in years in
which both are conducted, in order to reduce burdens on units and to
ensure an acceptable level of consistency between the results from the two
surveys.
●Panels should be constructed in such a way that they do not affect the main
cross-sectional survey.
●If possible, information from other surveys on employment, sales, value
added and investment should be linked to the panel survey as well as thelarger cross-sectional innovation survey for empirical analyses.
3.6. Survey methods and suitable respondents
446. A variety of methods can be used to conduct innovation surveys,including postal surveys and personal interviews. Each of these methods has
different strengths and weaknesses. Post al surveys are well established and
comparatively less expensive, but may present problems. Several reminders,including telephone reminders, are us ually necessary to increase response
rates to an acceptable level. Actions that can be taken to increase response
rates further include: contacting respon dents prior to conducting the survey,
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005123sending a cover letter from the minister, sending basic results of previous
innovation surveys, providing the possibility of reporting to an “intelligent
questionnaire” via the Internet or a promise to send respondents the main
findings from the current survey.2
447. Many of the problems with postal surveys can be avoided when data
are collected by personal interview, using for example, CATI or CAPI
techniques. Interviewers can give guid elines on answering the questionnaire.
The quality of the results for CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviews)
techniques is in general expected to be higher and item non-response rates
are expected to be lower. However, CAPI methods in particular are more costlythan postal surveys.
448. A drawback to CATI (computer-assi sted telephone interviews) is the
question of collecting quantitative data  on innovation activity. This generally
takes time to calculate, so that respondents may not be able to answer the
entire questionnaire in a single call. Additionally, in large units,
questionnaires are answered jointly by different offices or branches, so that
several calls may be needed to complete a single questionnaire.
449. An alternative approach is the use of online or automated data
exchange collection technologies. It pr esents a difference in terms of the use
of filtering questions. In  a paper questionnaire resp ondents see all questions
and are able to modify their responses to a filtering question. An electronic
questionnaire can be design ed so that respondents do not see all questions
and therefore cannot alter their answers in light of additional information (the
same may be true for CATI and CAPI form ats). One option could be to allow all
respondents to see the entire questionnaire, including the questions thatrespondents may not be required to answer. This approach also raises issues
of confidentiality and continuity ( e.g.returning to the questionnaire several
times before it is finished).
450. Choosing the unit’s most suitable respondent is particularly important
in innovation surveys, as the ques tions are very specialised and can be
answered by only a few people in the unit, often not those who complete other
statistical questionnaires. In small un its, managing directors are often good
respondents. In larger units, several people are often involved, but one must
be responsible for co-ordinating the replies. It is highly recommended to
make a special effort to identify resp ondents by name before data collection
starts.
3.7. The questionnaire
451. Some basic rules should be follow ed when designing the questionnaire
for an innovation survey. Each questionnaire should be tested before it is usedin the field (pre-test). Pre-testing can include interviewing a group of
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005124managers or experts concerning their understanding of the draft
questionnaire and sending the questionna ire to a small sample of units. Both
steps can be valuable for improving the quality of the questionnaire.
452. The questionnaire should be as simp le and short as possible, logically
structured, and have clear definitions and instructions. Generally, the longer
the questionnaire, the lower the unit and item response  rates. This effect can
be minimised by devoting special attention to design and layout and by givingclear and sufficient explanatory note s and examples. It is particularly
important to design the questionnair e in such a way that units with no
innovation activities will  nonetheless reply and answer the questions that are
relevant for them.
453. Respondents’ understand ing of the questionnair e may well increase as
they move from question to question. This means that their answers maydepend on the order of the questions. Adding or deleting a question may
influence subsequent answers.
454. Questions on a number of qualitativ e indicators can use either a binary
scale (yes or no), or an ordinal scale, e.g.when enterprises are asked whether
the factor is relevant and, if so, its importance. The binary scale has the
advantage of being simple and reliable, but it provides only limitedinformation on the factor s considered. However, it may introduce a high
degree of subjectivity if the answer  cannot be based on facts, owing to
differences in the interpretation of th e question. An ordinal scale allows the
ranking of factors in terms of their importance, although this also introduces
a degree of subjectivity. Analytical methods are available, however, to
minimise such problems with ordinal response scales.
455. In the case of international inno vation surveys, special attention
should be given to the translation and design of the questionnaire. Even minor
differences between national questionna ires can restrict the comparability of
the results. Such differences can stem, for example, from translation, from
changes in the order of questions, or from adding or deleting categories. A
sound translation which takes account of particular local circumstances (suchas a country’s legal system) will help avoid misunderstandings of concepts
and definitions.
3.7.1. Short-form questionnaires
456. For many small units and units in se ctors with little innovation activity,
the response burden for a full innovation questionnaire may be quite largerelative to their innovation activity . Unit non-response rates may also be
higher for these units. In such cases, shorter survey questionnaires that focus
on a set of core questions can be useful . Short-form questionnaires can also be
used in surveying units that have not reported innovation activity in previous
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005125innovation surveys. Conversely, for individual units in the above-mentioned
groups (small units or less innovative sectors) which have previously reported
substantial innovation activity, fu ll questionnaires may be used.
3.8. Innovation and R&D surveys
457. Because R&D and innovation are re lated phenomena, some countries
may consider the combination of R&D and innovation surveys. There are a
number of arguments for and against:
●With a combined survey, the overall re sponse burden of the reporting units
will be reduced (a single questionnaire, instead of two separate surveys
asking some of the same questions).
●If the length of the questionnaire for combined surveys is much longer than
for a separate survey, response rates may decline.
●A combined survey offers scope for analysing the relations between R&D
and innovation activities at the unit level. There is less scope for this with
separate surveys, especially when these are carried out by different
institutions.
●There is a risk that units not familiar with the concepts of R&D and
innovation may confuse them in a combined survey.
●Combined surveys offer an efficient method of increasing the frequency of
innovation surveys.
●Country experiences (for example, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands,
Norway and Spain) indicate that it is possible to obtain reliable results for
R&D expenditures in combined surveys.
●The frames for the two surveys are generally different. For example, the
frame population for innovation surveys may cover industrial
classifications (and sma ll units) that are not included in R&D surveys.
Combining them may involve sending questions about R&D to a largenumber of non-R&D performers that are included in the frame population
for the innovation survey. This would increase the cost of the joint survey.
458. In principle, business surveys othe r than for R&D can also be merged
with innovation surveys. Some experiences in merging innovation surveys
with structural business surveys have b een conducted (for example, Bulgaria,
Italy and the Netherlands). Additionally , business surveys on the diffusion of
ICTs, and on the adoption of knowledge management practices can be
considered for integration with innovation surveys.
459. While the Manual does not recomm end the use of combined surveys,
country experience indicates that they provide a feasible option for increasing
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005126the frequency of data collection. Some  guidelines for conducting combined
surveys are:
●In order to reduce the risk of co nceptual confusion between R&D and
innovation, the questionnaire should have two distinct sections. Separatesections should also be used when combining innovation with other types
of surveys.
●To avoid declines in response rate s, individual sections for R&D and
innovation should be smaller than in separate surveys, so that the overall
length of the combined survey is comp arable to that of a separate survey.
●Comparisons of results from combined surveys with those from separate
innovation surveys should be done  with care, and surveying methods
should be reported.
●Samples to carry out su ch surveys should be extracted from a common
business register in order to avoid in consistencies in the frame populations.
4. Estimation of results
4.1. Weighting methods
460. The results of sample surveys need to be weighted to obtain
information that is representative for the target population. There are various
methods for weighting sampling results. The simplest is weighting by the
inverse of the sampling fractions of th e sampling units, corrected by the unit
non-response. If a stratified sampling technique with different sampling
fractions is used, weights should be calculated individually for each stratum.
461. The weights can be further refined by calibration if the frame
population includes some quantitative or qualitative information on all units,
such as number of employees, turnover, legal status or region. The calibration
will ensure that the weighted sample  sums to the total population or
distribution and in that way will increa se precision and reduce bias. Effective
calibration software, in particular CLAN  from Statistics Sweden, CALMAR from
INSEE (France) and CALJACK from Statistics Canada, are available for use byother countries.
462. Weights are most commonly based on  the number of enterprises in a
stratum. However, it may be beneficial for quantitative variables to weight theresults by number of employees or turnover. In international and other
comparisons it is important to ensure  that the same weighting method is
used.
4.2. Non-response
463. In practice responses to innovati on surveys are always incomplete,
irrespective of the survey method used. T wo types of missing values can be
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005127distinguished: item and unit non-responses. Unit non-response  means that a
reporting unit does not reply at all. Possible reasons are, for example, that the
surveying institute cannot reach the reporting unit or that the reporting unit
refuses to answer. In contrast, item non-response  refers to the response rate to a
specific question and is equal to the percentage of blank or missing answers
among the reporting units. Item non-response rates are frequently higher for
quantitative questions than for questions using binary or ordinal responsecategories.
464. Item and unit non-responses woul d be less a problem if the missing
values were randomly distributed over all sampling units and all questions. In
reality, however, both types of missing values may be biased with respect to
certain characteristics of the po pulation and the questionnaire.
465. Disregarding missing values and applying simple weighting procedures
based only on the responses received implicitly assumes that non-
respondents are distributed in the same way as respondents. If non-
respondents do not follow the same di stribution, for example if non-response
units have a lower propensity to innovate, this practice will give biased results.
466. A number of methods can be used to minimise the problems of non-
response. As different methods may lead to different results, some generalguidelines should be followed. An ap propriate first step in dealing with
missing values is to contact the respon dent to collect the missing information.
467. For practical as well as theoretica l reasons, one way to minimise the
problem of item non-response is to  use imputation methods to estimate
missing values on the basis of additional information. The idea is that the use
of additional information will allow more accurate estimates of missingvalues than simply using the mean observed value and will minimise non-
response bias.
468. Among imputation methods, cold -deck techniques can be employed
first, in which missing information is estimated using data from other
statistical surveys (including previous surveys) or from other related sources.
For any remaining missing values, surveys may consider hot-deck methods.Hot-deck methods cover a large variety of options, such as replacing the
missing values for each variable by the mean of the strata, by predicting the
value using regression techniques, or by using nearest neighbour techniqueswhere the missing values are replaced by the values of the unit which is most
similar with respect to other relevant variables. The decision about the most
appropriate hot-deck method should al so be based on the type of variable
(quantitative or qualitative).
469. The choice of method to treat th e problem of unit non-response will
depend on the level of non-response. If  the non-response rate is fairly low,
3
the weighting should be calculated on th e basis of the units that replied. This
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005128procedure assumes that the innovative  behaviour of responding and non-
responding units is identical. The assumption can be tested through a non-
response analysis. Even if the assumption is wrong, the bias introduced can be
disregarded if the fraction of non- responding units is fairly small.
470. In contrast, if the unit non-response  rate is very high, no method can be
recommended to solve the problem. In such a case the results of the
innovation survey can only be used as case studies. No conclusions should be
drawn about the target population in general, as the bias may be too great.
471. In all other cases, i.e.when the unit non-response rate is above a lower
threshold but below an upper threshol d, some more complicated and partly
more expensive techniques can be used. One is to select reporting units that
have answered randomly until the response rate is 100%, i.e.to use the results
of randomly selected units twice or even more often.
472. Other methods are based on the results of a non-response analysis . The
objective of non-response analysis is to obtain information on why reporting
units did not answer. Non-reporting unit s should be contac ted by phone or by
mail (using a very simple questionnaire not exceeding one page) and should
be asked for general information such as their sector of activity and size (if not
already available from other sources), the reason why they did not answer.They should be asked to answer a few key questions in the original survey to
see whether the results are biased. This information can then be used to
adjust the weights. The results of the non-response analysis should only be
used if the response rate is very high.
5. Presentation of results
473. The results of innovation surveys can be used either for descriptive orfor inferential analysis. The objective of descriptive analysis  is to describe the
statistical units in terms of their i nnovative or non-innovative activities
without drawing any conclusions about the underlying survey or targetpopulation (if it is not a census). In this type of analysis the results are taken
without further weighting, as obse rved for the individual units. No
generalisation of the results at the leve l of the survey or target population is
possible, because the figures only refer to the participating units. For this kind
of analysis, unit non-response rate is of minor importance.
474. In contrast, the objective of inferential analysis  is to dr a w conclusions
about the target population. In this case the results should give a
representative estimation of the situ ation for the observed and unobserved
statistical units taken together. Inferential analysis requires weighted results.For this type of analysis, the unit non-re sponse rate is very important: if the
unit non-response rate exceeds a certai n threshold, the potential bias may be
so large that inferential analysis is useless.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005129475. As mentioned above, most innovation surveys are carried out as
random sample surveys. The results of these surveys will include two types of
error: random errors due to the random process used to select the units, and
systematic errors containing all non-random errors (bias). To get at least anidea of the variance for the results, it is recommended to calculate both
(average) values for innovation indicators and also their coefficients of
variation and/or confidence intervals.  Such intervals include the true but
unknown values in the survey population with a very high probability,
assuming no bias. Standard errors give a lower threshold for the unknown
total error of the indicators under consideration.
476. The presentation of results should contain metadata, including
information on the procedure used to collect data, sampling methods,
procedures for dealing with non-respon se and quality indicators. This will
allow users to better interpret the data and judge its quality.
6. Frequency of data collection
477. Theoretical and practical considerations, as well as user needs at theinternational, national and regional level, determine the frequency ofinnovation surveys. The increasing importance of innovation for the growth of
economies requires more frequent an d more up-to-date data. From this
viewpoint, information on innovation activities should ideally be collected
annually. Moreover, theoretical consid erations indicate that innovation
activities occur in waves so that th e results of less regular surveys very
dependent on the time when the survey is carried out. Only a few countries,
however, can afford or are willing to run innovation surveys every year.
478. Taking into account both practical considerations and user needs, it is
recommended to conduct innovation surveys every two years. However,
where this is not economically feasible , a frequency of three or four years
may be chosen.
479. To ensure comparability among re spondents, surveys must specify an
observation period  for questions on innovation. The choice of the length of
the observation period is a compromise between different requirements. Along observation period allows for th e collection of data on intermittent
innovation activities and the effects of  innovations. For example, firms with
products that have longer life cycles may innovate less frequently. Conversely,a short observation period improves resp ondent recall and the accuracy of the
results. For longer observation periods,  organisational memory may be poor,
owing either to staff turnover or to less  reliable respondent recall. Other issues
concern the relation between  the frequency of collection and the observation
period. An observation period that is longer than the frequency of collection
(creating overlap in the coverage of innovation surveys) has some drawbacks.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005130The overlap in coverage may make it difficult to attribute innovation fully to
the time period since the preceding surv ey. It can also affect comparison of
results over time, since it may be unclear whether changes in results are
mainly due to innovation activities in th e period since the last survey or in the
year that is also covered in the previous survey. As stated in Chapter 3, Section 8,
it is recommended that the length of  the observation period for innovation
surveys should not exceed three ye ars nor be less than one year.
Notes
1. pps-sampling = The units are included with Probabilities Proportional to their
Size, often measured as number of employees in the business sector.
2. Further guidelines for improving response rates for postal surveys can be found in
Dillman (1978) and in Moore and Baxter (1993). 
3. It is difficult, if not impossible, to define when a unit non-response rate is deemed
to be high or low. However, it is generally acknowledged that the higher the unit
non-response rate, the lower the comparability of the results of innovation
surveys.

Innovation Surveys in Developing Countries
1. Introduction
480. This annex provides guidelines fo r the implementation of innovation
surveys in developing countries. The term “developing countries” is used here
with the assumption that it does not refer to a homogeneous set of countries,
and that the annex needs to reflect the different characteristics of economies
and societies in a rapidly evolving “developing world”.
481. After the publication of the second edition of the Oslo Manual , many
developing countries in various regi ons of the world conducted innovation
surveys. The design of these surveys was usually intended to comply with Oslo
Manual  standards. However, almost all of these innovation measurement
exercises resulted in adaptations of th e proposed methodologies, in order to
capture the particular characteristics of innovation processes in countries
with economic and social structures different from those of the moredeveloped OECD countries. These adaptations were prepared by each country
and adopted different approaches. Outsid e the OECD and EU, the first effort to
compile these particularities and gu ide the design of cross-nationally
comparable innovation surveys was conducted in Latin America by RICYT
(Ibero-American Network on Scie nce and Technology Indicators – Red
Iberoamericana de Indicadores de Ciencia y Tecnología ) and resulted in the
publication of the Bogotá Manual, which was later used in most innovation
surveys conducted in Latin American countries and extended to other regions.
The importance and impact of this standard-setting work inspired theproduction of this annex.
482. Preparation of the annex was co-ord inated by the UNESCO Institute for
Statistics (UIS). A base document provided by RICYT
1 was submitted to a panel
of researchers and practitioners with experience in innovation surveys in
developing countries.2 This annex is based on the conclusions of this exercise.
Proposals and recommendations may be more or less applicable depending onthe characteristics of the region and countries concerned.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005136483. Recommendations in this  annex are mainly based on the experience of
countries that have already conducted innovation surveys, most of which are
among the higher- and me dium-income countries of the developing world,
where innovation has already become a policy issue. Nevertheless, the
knowledge gained by these countries sh ould help other developing countries
to acquire their own experience without having to build exclusively on
innovation measurement exercises carried out in developed countries.
2. The characteristics of innovation in developing countries
484. It is widely accepted that disse mination mechanisms and incremental
change account for most of the innovation occurring in developing countries,3
owing to the particular characteristics of the society and the economy in many
of these countries which influence innovation processes in many ways.
2.1. Size and structure of markets and firms
485. It is important to know about th e size and structure of firms and
markets in order to understand develo ping countries’ innovation processes.
While the sector of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is very
significant (including a large number of micro and small and, in some
countries, medium-sized businesses which are often not registered), evenenterprises considered “large” in most developing countries usually operate at
suboptimal production scales, with hi gher unit costs and far from optimal
efficiency. Competitiveness is mostly based on the exploitation of natural
resources or cheap labour, rather than on  efficiency or differentiated products.
This leads to an informal organisation of innovation and fewer R&D projects.
486. Important market failures rela ted to economies of scale and
externalities present high barriers to  innovation. For instance, productive
processes and, more specifically, i nnovation activities are subject to
indivisibilities and a lack of economie s of scale, and this influences the
viability of R&D projects.
2.2. The innovation landscape in developing countries
487. A number of exogenous system ic factors shape the innovation
landscape in developing countries, such as: macroeconomic uncertainty;
instability; physical infrastructure (lack of basic services such as electricity or“old” communications technologies); institutional fragility; lack of social
awareness about innovation; risk-averse nature of enterprises; lack of
entrepreneurs; existence of barriers to business start-up; lack of public policy
instruments for business support  and management training.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051372.2.1. Instability
488. Instability in micro and small bu sinesses may mean that some have
good potential to upgrade national i nnovative performance and function as
cradles of innovators, while some lack resources and support for any
innovation. Macro level uncertainty limits any long-term innovation activity.
2.2.2. Informality
489. Developing countries’ economies rely significantly on informal
practice. Informality is not a favo urable context for innovation. The
sometimes great creativity invested in solving problems in the informal
economy does not lead to systematic ap plication and thus tends to result in
isolated actions which neither increase capabilities nor help establish aninnovation-based development path.
2.2.3. Particular economic and innovation environments
490. Many enterprises in developing co untries operate in unusual economic
and innovation environments owing to  the existence, and in some cases
prevalence, of state-owned enterpri ses (China) or massive parastatal
enterprises (some Arab states), where a lack of competition sometimes
discourages innovation or drains loca l markets of innovative potential.,
although big state-owned enterprises (f or example in sectors such as oil,
aerospace or telecommunications) sometimes become technological leaders
through important investments in experimental development work (as in
some Latin American countries). Moreover, in countries with less developedeconomic systems, major government  S&T policies and programmes may
have more impact on innovation than the activities and strategies of private
enterprises.
491. Past techno-economic paradigms have continuing economic
importance in some cases; in others, a paradigm switch is delayed owing to
the high costs involved, insufficient supplies of local capital and lack of creditfor big technological investments.
492. Local markets in developing countries tend to be small, sometimes as a
result of a less developed infrastructu re, and this reduces the scope of the
enterprise’s actions and the relevance of actual innovations (“new to the
market” may have a different me aning in such environments).
493. Innovations in the agricultural se ctor have a high economic impact,
owing to the sector’s significant overall economic weight.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051382.2.4. Reduced innovation decision-making powers
494. The dominance of externally contro lled or multinational corporations
results in less decision making by local enterprises or subsidiaries (especially
in the area of innovation), mainly becaus e of the division of functions in these
organisations. In the last few years, th is division has even been extended to
independent local enterprises in the fr amework of international manufacturing
networks. Technology transfer from multinational corporations and from
abroad is therefore a fundamental source of innovation.
2.2.5. Weak innovation systems
495. Fewer resources are devoted to innovation activities system-wide,
thereby reducing the innovation potentia l of enterprises. The government is a
major player in R&D execution and funding, mainly owing to a low level of
resources devoted to R&D by businesses.
496. Flows of information within nati onal systems of innovation are
fragmented, and in some cases there is an absence of linkages between
science and enterprises. Weak or absent linkages challenge the capacities of
firms to overcome (technology-related) problems and draw firms towardssolutions that mostly rely on acquisition of embodied technology.
497. Barriers to accumulation of capabilities by enterprises are high and
difficult to tackle, particularly in the case of highly qualified human capital,
local and international linkages, and tacit knowledge incorporated in
organisational routines.
2.2.6. Characteristics of innovation
498. The acquisition of embodied technology (equipment) for both product
and process innovation is a major component of innovation.
499. Minor or incremental changes are th e most frequent type of innovation
activity in some developing countries, together with innovative applications
of existing products or processes.
500. Organisational change is an extremely significant aspect of the
innovation process. Besides its direct impact on enterprise performance, it
also contributes to the enterprise’s ability to absorb new technologiesincorporated in machiner y and other equipment (the  most frequent type of
innovation). Heterogeneity frequently prevails with regard to firms’
technological, organisational and managerial patterns, with “high-technology” firms coexisting with informal businesses, and with many
enterprises lacking a formal organisation al structure. This creates a need for
organisational change, often independen t of product and process innovation.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051393. Innovation measurement in developing countries
501. Innovation measurement in deve loping countries has to produce
results comparable to those obtained in developed countries that use the Oslo
Manual  in order to enable benchmarking and construct a coherent
international system of innovation in dicators. At the same time, innovation
surveys need to respect and be able to pick up the characteristics of innovation
in developing countries presented in Section 2. Therefore, the definition ofinnovation, its subtypes (product, process, marketing and organisational
innovation), innovation activities an d the innovative firm, as presented in
Chapter 3, should be applied in innova tions surveys in developing countries.
502. While most of the issues presented in Section 2 are addressed below,
some continue to present problems from the measurement point of view. This
is mainly due to the difficulty of applyi ng existing definitions. One of the main
issues, also mentioned in Section 5, is  the problem of measuring incremental
changes, which may not result in “new or significantly improved” products or
processes. Another pending issue is rela ted to the scope of innovations, since
concepts such as “new to the market” may have different interpretations in
environments with less developed infrastructure.
3.1. Specific needs for public policy and private strategies: 
the potentially innovative firms
503. Innovation surveys in developing countries need to be based on
methods and procedures that take into account the aspects mentioned inSection 1 in order to become useful instruments for public and private
decision making. In developing countries, the main reason for conducting
innovation surveys is to inform public policy making and the design ofbusiness strategies, with the main focus on the generation, diffusion,
appropriation and use of new knowledge in businesses. Less priority is given
to cross-country comparisons and benchmarking.
504. Measurement exercises should therefore focus on the innovation
process rather than its outputs and em phasise how capabilities, efforts and
results are dealt with. The efforts made by firms and organisations
(innovation activities) and capabilities (stocks and flows) are, for this reason,
equally or even more important to determine and analyse than the results
(innovations). Factors hampering or facilitating innovation are seen as keyindicators in this context.
505. A particular subject of interest in developing countries is the
“potentially innovative firm”. Innovation-active firms are those “that have hadinnovation activities during the period under review, including those with
ongoing and abandoned activities”. Potentially innovative firms are a subset of
t h e s e ,  t h o s e  t h a t  h a v e  m a d e  i n n o v a t i o n  e f f o r t s  ( i.e.conducted innovation
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005140activities) but have not achieved resu lts (innovations) during the period of
analysis.
506. Inside this group, might be found bu sinesses that have innovated in the
past, or businesses that may innovate  in the near future. Nevertheless,
considering that products and proces ses become obsolete rapidly, the
existence of a large number of potentially innovative enterprises may suggest
strong barriers to innovation, or premature attempts to innovate in theabsence of the necessary resources. A key element in innovation policies in
developing countries is to assist potentially innovative firms to overcome the
obstacles that prevent them  from being innovative and to convert their efforts
into innovations.
3.2. Measurement priorities
507. Measurement priorities in developing countries have to take into
account different responses to common questions ( why do we measure
innovation , what should we measure, and how should we measure ), which
result in different priorities when designing an innovation survey.  The first
question refers to the aims or the main  functions of these surveys. The second
and third help to clarify the object to be measured and the most suitable
methods and procedures. The third question  is closely related or even derived
from the first.
508. In developing countries, the respon ses sought from innovation surveys
are less the number of innovative enterp rises, or even innovation counts, than
information that will allow public an d private stakeholders to analyse the
various innovation strategies  present in the innovation system under
scrutiny, and to evaluate and unders tand how these patterns contribute to
strengthening the competitiveness of  particular enterprises and more
generally to economic and social development. These data also allow for theconstruction of different models of  technological behaviour followed by
enterprises.
509. This approach requires linking the analysis of micro, meso and
macroeconomic levels; relating innovati on data to the technological content
of exports; studying strengths and we aknesses of particular industries or
innovation systems in general; a ssessing the absorption capacity of
innovation systems; identifying networ ks; exploring the relationship between
the formal education sy stem and employment; an d obtaining indications
about the effectiveness of different public instruments for supporting andpromoting innovation.
510. In order to construct indicators  of potentially innovative firms,
measurement instruments need to take account of all enterprises ( i.e.both
innovative and non-innovative), particularly when addressing the main issues
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005141related to innovation strategies , such as  innovation activities , obstacles ,
capabilities , linkages  and results .
3.2.1. Innovation capabilities
511. Innovation capabilities are extremely helpful for classifying firms and
industrial sectors in developing coun tries. A firm’s capabilities are what
mainly allow it to take advantage of market opportunities. The mostsignificant innovation capability is the knowledge accumulated by the firm,
w h i c h  i s  m a i n l y  e m b e d d e d  i n  h u m a n  r e s o u r c e s ,  b u t  i s  a l s o  i n  p r o c e d u r e s ,
routines and other characteristics of the firm. Innovation capabilities , as well
as technological capabilities, are the result of learning processes, which are
conscious and purposeful, costly and time-consuming, non-linear and path-
dependent and cumulative. Because of the interactive , technology-specific
and culturally influenced nature of trajectories, a range of possible
development paths exists, particularly in developing countries where
innovativeness and entrepreneurship  may be infrequent and possess
particular characteristics.
512. Knowledge about innovation capabilities and the firm’s efforts to
increase these are key to understandin g its present and future performance.
Innovation capabilities condition the design of strategies to introduce
changes, improvements and/or innovations ( innovation strategies ). If
innovation strategies are at the heart of  policy interest, innovation capabilities
are the most important issue for the design of an innovation survey in
developing countries.
513. Many difficulties are involved in measuring innovation capabilities,
since it is necessary to measure knowledg e that is not codified, but “stored” in
individuals’ minds or organisational rout ines. At the same time, it is not easy
to obtain reliable data from firms about the exchange of knowledge with otheragents or organisations.
514. The priority given in developing countries to measuring innovation
capabilities  motivates placing additional emphasis on certain aspects of
surveys:
●Human resources.
●Linkages.
●Information and communication technologies (ICTs), their incorporation
and use.
515. There is also an increased need to examine more complex issues such
as the types of decision-making support  systems put in place by the firm’s
direction and management, as well as the firm’s actual potential for
knowledge absorption.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051423.2.2. Expenditure on innovation activities
516. In order to measure firms’ innovation efforts  appropriately, it is
essential to understand the intensity of innovation activities carried out. It is
therefore recommended to obtain more details about which innovation
activities were undertaken by the firm  in the reference period and, where
deemed feasible, to collect data on expenditure by innovation activity, as
indicated in Chapter 6. This indicator serves as a powerful discriminator of
firms’ behaviour and strategies. In order to explain firm development,
innovation expenditure needs to be complemented by more generalinformation on the development of the sector of economic activity in which
the firm is active. This informatio n can be obtained through innovation
surveys if it is not readily available th rough other sources at national statistics
offices.
3.2.3. Organisational innovation
517. The absorption of new technologies , mostly incorporated in machinery
and other equipment, can require significant organisational change for many
enterprises in developing countries. Since innovation in developing countrieshas a strong component of absorption of technologies generated in
industrialised countries, organisati onal change acquires substantive
relevance. The enterprise’s behaviour in this field therefore becomesimportant for explaining differences in performance and competitiveness.
4
518. In order to gain additional informat ion on the innovative capabilities of
enterprises in developing countries,  questions on the implementation of
organisational innovations can be supplemented by questions on human
resources and training and the incorporation of ICTs. Both would help to
provide an indication of an enterprise’s innovative capabilities.
4. Principal adaptations
519. Three main topics might be taken into account in adapting innovation
surveys for developing countries: ICTs , linkages and innovation activities.
4.1. ICTs in innovation surveys
520. The role of ICTs in innovation is  related both to “front-office” and
“back-office” applications (see Box A .1). In developing countries, the
incorporation of ICTs in enterpri ses has frequently been limited to
sophisticated “front-office” applications (such as Web page, call centre, e-mailor digital brochures and catalogues). However, it is considered that the main
impact on the enterprise’s performa nce can be obtained by implementing
ICTs to support or automate critical activities or processes (“back-office”).
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005143Thus, innovation surveys in developing countries should focus on the use of
ICTs , which is a powerful tool for differentiating situations, since even
medium and large firms frequently do not have a consolidated management
system, the lack of which constitutes a serious obstacle to achieving better
performance in the various areas of the business.
521. This analysis of the “deeper” dimensions of ICT implementation in
firms would help to expose the differen ces between enterpri se characteristics
in developing and in industrialised countries, especially in the medium-
income developing countries where th e difference may not be evident when
analysing only the more “superficial” fron t-office ICTs. It is still not possible to
carry out a definitive stat istical analysis of the re lation between deeper and
more complex integration of ICTs and business performance in developing
countries. However, partial evidence  and case studies have shown the
potential for further research, particularly through innovation surveys.
Further evidence will help to clarif y the relationship between ICTs and
innovation, complementing the more readily available literature on ICT andproductivity.
522. Taking into account the fact that questionnaires should be as short and
simple as possible, in cases where no sp ecific surveys on ICTs in businesses are
available, innovation surveys should enquire about available infrastructure; use
of ICTs (separating front- and back-office activities) and the ultimate purpose of
ICT usage; existence of internal ICT ma nagement and development capabilities;
ICT expenditure and its relationship with organisational innovation.
4.2. Linkages
523. Following the recommendations in Chapter 5, emphasis  should be put
on measuring linkages. In order to enable  the weighting of the firm’s different
linkages, a proxy measure of complexity can be developed by crossing “type”
and “objective” of the linkages. This can be done by establishing a matrix ofBox A.1. “Front office” vs. “back office”
Front-office applications include th ose focused on sales and marketing,
customer self service, Web portals and call centres. The common thread
is a high level of employee  or customer interaction.
A back-office is a part of most corp orations and carries out tasks needed
for the running of the company itself. Back-office activities are an
organisation’s internal operations that support core processes and are
not accessible or visible to the general public. Back-office applications
support or automate critical  activities or processes.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005144linkage agents  (i.e.universities, technical and vocational training institutions,
technological centres, test labs, suppli ers, clients, head office, enterprises
belonging to the same group, other firm s, consultants, R&D firms, public S&T
agencies), and types of linkage  (including open information sources,
acquisition of knowledge and technology, and innovation co-operation,
supplemented by complementary activities, particularly access to new sources of
financing and to commercial information ).
524. The innovation success of developed countries is related to the fact that
they offer regional environments in which firms can reach the knowledge
sources they need, combined with broa d access to leading global knowledge
bases. Firms in developing countries most frequently do not have access to
high-end knowledge, and therefore the local environment is very important
for them. Consequently, it is recommended to include questions on the
geographical location of linkages . One possible breakdown is local, regional,
national and international locations.
4.3. Innovation activities
525. The need to focus on the activities  and capabilities of firms leads to
more attention to some specific inno vation activities, as classified in
Chapter 6. In order to comply with th e priority criteria presented, it is
recommended to include activities such as:
●“Hardware purchase”, and “Softwar e purchase” (separately, not just
included in “Acquisition of mach inery, equipment and other capital
goods”).
●“Industrial design”, and “Engineerin g activities” (separately, not just

4.4. Additional adaptations
526. It is recommended to collect data on human resources, from the
perspective of both its composition (by qualification, type of occupation – see
Chapter 6 – and gender) and its management. From the point of view of human
resource management, it is particular ly important to collect information on
actions taken by firms with regard to training, including the resources involved.
In order to obtain information on the innovative capabilities of enterprises, data
can be collected not only on training acti vities that are linked to innovation, but
also on general training in areas such as management and administrative
training, ICT, industrial se curity and quality control.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 20051455. Methodological issues for developing country contexts
5.1. Information system specificities
527. The design and planning of innovation surveys in developing countries
needs to take into account the relative weakness of statistical systems .
Linkages between surveys and data sets  tend to be weak or nonexistent,
preventing the use of information from other surveys both in the design of the
exercise and in the analysis of its results. The weakness, or sometimes lack, ofofficial business registers, which are normally used as sample frames, is
another example of this type of problem.
528. It is particularly important to invo lve national statistics offices (NSOs)
in innovation surveys, even if such surv eys do not constitute a high priority in
the national statistical programmes of some developing countries.
Involvement of NSOs may sometime s include the signing of formal
agreements between the various institutions (which frequently include
government departments and universiti es). The participation of NSOs in
innovation surveys brings to the table experience in the design andapplication of surveys and allows the re solution of problems in registers and
other background information. It also helps to obtain higher response rates,
and raises the possibility of making th e survey compulsory. Moreover, if the
sample used is the same as for othe r economic surveys, it presents the
possibility of wider-ranging analysis.
529. Statistical systems in developing  countries frequently lack the
necessary information about firm pe rformance (such as data on sales,
investments, exports), only have outdated data or cannot provide data in a
suitable form for statistical analysis. In such cases, a number of basic variables
can be included in the innovation survey in order to enable analysis of the
relationship between actions taken by firms for innovation and market
performance (competitiveness). Howeve r, a tension between the need for
extra questions and the response bu rden exists. In order to maximise
response rates and improve coverage, a balance should be sought, taking into
account that operational simplicity an d fluidity may be detrimental to the
analytical potential of the exercise.
5.2. General methodological considerations
5.2.1. Application of the survey
530. Interviews made in person (instead of surveys by mail or by phone) and
by adequately trained staff (for instance, undergraduate or graduate students)
are recommended, since they have proved to have a positive impact on the
response rate and on the quality of the results obtained.5 This is particularly
important in developing country contexts where postal services may not be
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005146reliable. Moreover, interviews conducted by qualified staff provide the
respondent with immediate and releva nt assistance in completing the
questionnaire, thereby improving the quality of the results.
5.2.2. Questionnaire design
531. The questionnaire can be design ed so that the sections can be
separated to allow different persons in the firm to reply to different sections.This is particularly valid for questions relating to the firm’s general economic
data, which may be provided by the fi nance division, or specific questions
about the innovation process, which may be completed by the product or plant
manager. This may result in more reliable information.
6 It is nevertheless
important to avoid delaying the survey or losing a partially completed
questionnaire because of this strategy.
532. It is also advisable to include guidance in the main questionnaire, in
order to help the respondent understand  and avoid losing the instructions. It
is important to recognise that in some developing countries respondents maynot understand the concept of “innovation” or even the word. If this may be
the case, questions must include definitions.
533. Special attention has to be give n to the language in which the
questionnaire is written. The wordin g needs to be adapted to meet the
knowledge and experience of an “average ” respondent. In some cases, it may
be necessary to present questionnaires in more than one language to helprespondents.
7
5.2.3. Frequency and other recommendations
534. While Chapter 8 of the Manual re commends conducting innovation
surveys every two years, it is recognised that in developing country contexts
the periodicity should be every three or four years. If possible, the innovation
surveys should be timed to coincide with the major international innovation
surveys, such as the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) rounds in Europe, in
order to obtain comparable data for similar time periods. It is also convenientto update a minimum set of variables every year (the main quantitative ones,
for example), if resources permit. A less costly strategy is to attach a
significantly reduced qu estionnaire to an existing business survey.
535. The results of the innovation surveys should be published and
distributed widely, in order to encourag e further participation by businesses in
future rounds and to increase awareness and use by researchers and policymakers. Diffusion mechanisms need to be  included in the budget early in the
exercise.
OSLO MANUAL: GUIDELINES FOR COLLECTING AND INTERPRETING INNOVATION DATA
 ISBN 92-64-01308-3 – © OECD/EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES 2005147536. A frequent difficulty in obtaining reliable informatio n on innovation in
countries with a less developed statis tical tradition is business’s lack of
appreciation of the importance of innovation and the relevant public policy
instruments. Managers are frequently secretive about finance, and qualitativeinformation is sometimes more reliable  than quantitative information. The
purpose of surveys needs to be clea rly stated and the questions clearly
formulated. Under these circumstances, an adequate legislative base for the
collection of innovation statistics ca n help ensure the success of such an
exercise. In some cases, simplified qu estionnaires can be designed to cover
small firms, in order to encourage their participation in innovation surveys.
6. Thinking ahead
537. A number of important questions regarding innovation measurement
in developing countries remain unanswered. However, various approacheshave been tried out in different co untries and deserve further research,
involving issues such as:
●The role of entrepreneurs and their attitudes towards innovation.
●The intention to capture innovations driven by factors other than marketforces, and in particular innovations co nducted by the public sector (Salazar
and Holbrook, 2004).
●The adaptation of methodology to measure innovation in the primary
sector (particularly in agriculture).
●The development of indicators reflecting sub-national (regional) innovationsystems.
538. The application of the suggestion s made here can lead to broader
experience with innovation surveys in developing countries. It is expected
that some countries with better S&T statistics experience will soon go beyond
conducting R&D surveys and include inno vation surveys in their statistical
programmes. The consolidation of standards, concepts, formats and other
issues better suited for developing coun tries, such as those proposed in this
annex, should help build awareness and capacity. Further efforts in directcapacity building for innovation survey s will be key to the success of this
endeavour.

3. For example, the first South African inno vation survey found, for instance, that
86% of innovations in South African industry are of incremental nature.
4. In the particular case of many Latin American countries, the need for firms to
permanently adapt and adjust to recurrent alterations in the economic context
reinforces the idea that organisational change is an essential dimension of firms’
competitiveness.
5. This was found to be of particular importance in Latin America, and also in Africa,
where experience has shown that the response rate to mailed questionnaires is
extremely low.
6. The multiple informants approach has prov ed to increase reliability and validity of
the innovation survey in China.
7. In the case of the Thai survey, questions were presented in English and Thai, since
it was considered that sometimes people can understand technical terms in
English more easily than in their native language.

Examples of Innovations
1. Introduction
539. This annex provides a list of examples for each type of innovation.
These lists are intended as illustrations and should not by any means be
considered exhaustive. They are intended to give survey practitioners a better
understanding of each innovation type, but they are not designed to be shownto enterprises as examples of innovations. There are two reasons for this.
First, their inclusion might bias firms into excluding innovations that are not
on the list. Second, the list is date d, with many innovations impossible to
foresee. It is also worthwhile emphasising that two central criteria for
innovations are that they represent significant changes and that they are newto the firm. Thus, a change can be an innovation for one firm and not for
another. Often, more detailed descript ions are needed to determine whether a
change is to be classified as an innovation and of which type.
2. Examples of innovations
540. A  product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is
new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intendeduses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications,
