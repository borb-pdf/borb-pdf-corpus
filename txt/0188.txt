            To prevent occupational accidents:
               Clearly explain the basic rules that everyone should know  
               and apply.
               Strengthen prevention by encouraging people to step in whenever 
               they see something being done wrong.
               Stop work if the risk is not being properly managed.

    The Golden Rules
           The Golden Rules for safety at work are intended to be shared across Total’s 
           businesses and operations. They must be fully understood and obeyed  
           by everyone.
           These rules are intended for the people who organize work, the people who 
           carry it out and the people who inspect it.
           They are based on systematic processes for identifying, assessing  and 
           managing risks.
           They are one component of an appropriate identiifcation and sanction policy.
