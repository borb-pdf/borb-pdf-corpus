    An irresistible novel of food and desire, 
           based on a real-life love triangle between 
         a young woman, her husband, and his best friend.
  Los Angeles, 1934. Mary Frances is young, restlessly married, and returning from her ifrst sojourn in France. She is 
  hungry, and not just for food: she wants Tim, her husband Al’s charming friend, who encourages her writing and seems to 
  understand her better than anyone. After a night’s transgression, it’s only a matter of time before Mary Frances claims what 
  she truly desires, plunging all three of them into a tangled triangle of affection that will have far-reaching effects on their 
  families, their careers, and their lives. 
  Set in California, France, and the Swiss Alps, The Arrangement is a sparkling, sensual novel that explores the complexities 
  of a marriage and the many different ways in which we love. Writing at the top of her game, Ashley Warlick gives us a 
  completely mesmerizing story about a woman well ahead of her time, who would go on to become the legendary food 
  writer M. F. K. Fisher.

             M.F.K. Fisher’s Gingersnaps
             This recipe comes from a letter Fisher wrote to her biographer, Joan Reardon, that’s basically a run of apologies— 
             for not getting back to her more quickly, for not being in touch before the holidays, and for not sending the 
             gingersnap recipe, which is the recipe from Irma Rombauer’s The Joy of Cooking, but with triple the ginger. 
             “They are wonderful for parties at the end of any long meal or drinking bout…better than anything else for 
             traveling whether one is queasy or not.” She also speciifes that these should be made very small.
             INGREDIENTS
                 3⁄4 cup butter, softened
                 2 cups granulated sugar
                 2 eggs, well beaten
                 1⁄2 cup molasses
                 2 teaspoons vinegar (We used Champagne vinegar, but apple cider would work well, too.)
              3 3⁄4 cups all-purpose lfour
              1 1⁄2 teaspoons baking soda
                 6 teaspoons ground ginger
                 1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon
                 1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
             DIRECTIONS
             Preheat oven to 325°.
             In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and lfuffy. Add eggs, molasses and vinegar; beat well. 
             In a separate bowl, whisk together lfour, soda and spices. Gradually stir into wet ingredients, mixing to blend.
             With lfoured hands, roll into inch balls and place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 10-12 minutes, longer for crisp 
             cookies, less for chewy. 
             Makes about 15 dozen tiny cookies.
                Shrimp Pâté
                This recipe appears in How To Cook A Wolf, Fisher’s book on surviving wartime rationing, urging Americans 
                to shift their expectations at the table. “Balance the day,” she says, “not each meal in the day.” More than just 
                make-do attitude, she underscores how the scarcity of something can make us truly appreciate it when we 
                taste it, and with that appreciation, make us better people. 
                This recipe comes from the ifnal chapter “How To Practice True Economy,” wherein she recognizes enough 
                will be enough at some point and we will have to “throw discretion into the laundry bag,” and make one of 
                these indulgent recipes. Or until that day comes, and things like shrimp and butter are readily available again, 
                maybe just remember.
                INGREDIENTS
                    4 pounds fresh shrimp, cooked and shelled
                    1 medium onion, minced
                    1 cup melted butter
                    3 tablespoons lemon juice
                    1/2 cup mayonnaise
                    2 teaspoons dry mustard
                    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
                    Whatever other spice you want (I used 1/4 cup fresh minced parsley and 2 tablespoons minced                                  
                     chives, but if you’re keeping for longer than a few days, consider dried spices. I bet a good curry    
                     powder would be great.)
                DIRECTIONS
                Working in batches, grind shrimp and onion in a food processor until a ifne, pebbly mix. (No, Fisher didn’t 
                use a food processor. She calls for mashing shrimp and onion together with a potato masher. If you have that 
                patience and upper body strength, we’re sure sure it will result in a slightly different texture. We could not 
                seem to gather enough of either after the ifrst potato masher bit the dust.) 
                In a large bowl, mix ground shrimp mixture and melted butter with a wooden spoon until thoroughly 
                incorporated. Beat in lemon juice and mayonnaise; it will become a stiff paste. Add herbs and spices and 
                season to taste. (Fisher says to season highly, as it will be served cold.)
                If you’re lucky enough to have a pâté mold, pack it into that. If not, we used half pint mason jars, packing 
                tightly by spoonfuls and pressing out air bubbles. Refrigerate at least 24 hours, and up to one week. Serve 
                with crackers, crostini, or thinly sliced brown bread. 
                Makes 6-8 half pints.
             An Inanimate Martini
             Fisher was a good drinker, and her work is full of references to beautiful wine and classic, elegant cocktails, none 
             so lovely as her classiifcations for Martinis: “the safe, the perfect, and the intimate (and therefore pluperfect).” 
             The ifrst, you drink with strangers. The second, you order out at a restaurant from a barman you trust. The third 
             kind, she says, “should never be served in public, nor to any but the one or two people you know in the world. 
             It should never be drunk when weariness or the moon’s tides or the press of worldly business is too evident, nor 
             when red wine is to follow. But given an easy, airy evening, a pleasurable quitting of the day’s chores, and the 
             prospect of uninterrupted and peaceful communion with the One, it can be a ifne thing indeed.”
             INGREDIENTS
                 4 parts London-dry gin
                 1 eyedropper of vermouth (An eyedropper is a little less than half a teaspoon)
             DIRECTIONS
             Add gin and vermouth to a shaker or pitcher full of ice. Stir until very cold, and strain into a generous wine goblet. 
             Makes one.
                                                         Music
          I do listen to music while I write, often the same album over and over, until it becomes texture rather than 
          sound, a thing to focus me. I don’t think I’m very unique in that, amongst writers or inmates or penitents either. 
          Previous books have all had their unlikely soundtracks: Mary Chapin Carpenter, Tom Waits’ Small Change, 
          Palace Music. In general, single albums played again and again and again. 
          What happens when you write something for the better part of a decade is that the trick wears thin. You get 
          really really sick of the draft, the desk, and most of all, whatever damn song is playing. So I skipped around 
          more than ever before. The Arrangement was different, too, in that it’s set in the 1930s, in Los Angeles and 
          Europe, a landscape as lost to us as the Jurassic. Music was something of a moody tool to make scenes with.
                                          Here’s a selection of the decade’s greatest hits:
          THE THINGS WE DID AND DIDN’, The Magnetic Fields: Basically the whole book could be T DO
          scored by Stephen Merritt and I would happily just stretch out on the rug and listen for three days straight. This 
          song, “Busby Berkley’s Dreams”, “The Book Of Love”— all so off-center romantic, so lovely and lush in their 
          own weird and rather timeless ways. 
          A RECORD YEAR FOR RAINF, The Decemberists: This is one of those songs that I can catch ALL
          in my phrasing, certain lines that made it all the way to the book, or knocked around in scenes for four or ifve 
          drafts to be cut away in the end, even though I can still hear them in the space that’s left behind. In particular: 
          “temper set for tender,” and “to remember you in the entire.” There’s something so old-school, loosened-tie-
          and-dinner-jacket suggestive about remembering someone in the entire. The entire what, darling?
          A LITTLE SUGAR IN MY BO, Nina Simone: This is song is sexy like a woman on her thirWL             d martini. 
          There’s not much guessing to be done here. It’s a song with some layers to it for me though, as I came to Nina 
          Simone late in life, after college, when my best friend began dating a woman who liked to have Nina Simone 
          playing in the bedroom. She was the sort of woman who called him “Captain” in private, and that’s about the 
          only thing I know about what all they did in private, which would have been the ifrst time he kept anything 
          private. Which some twenty-ifve years later, still makes me blush a little bit. Or something like that.
          LET’S DANCE, M. Ward: This version is the kind of reimagining I love, in that it takes something that 
          was once dialed up high with teenage angst and middle school electricity, and makes it soft and romantic and 
          sad and even a little eerie. The way the chorus resolves sweetly, instead of racing towards hysterical the way it 
          does in Bowie’s hands. Plus, dancing. My mom always said she that’s what she thought you did on dates from a 
          childhood of growing up with Hollywood musicals, you danced and you sang to each other. 
          CALGARY Bon Iv,      er: The summer this album was released, it stayed in my headphones constantly. The line 
          here is “one piece swimmer stuck to you.” It’s just so tactile. There’s a moment in The Arrangement when Mary 
          Frances offers her husband an afternoon swim, and it’s kind of an olive branch, a possible distraction from the 
          blackness that’s swamping him, the best she can offer at the time. That swimmer, that suit sticking, that physical 
          reveal became part of how I saw it.
     ROMANCE IN THE D, Dinah Washington:ARK The sway of this song is just bone-deep powerful. But 
     too, I think Dinah does a perfect job of getting at the isolation, the privacy that makes for a really passionate 
     love affair. The darkness encapsulates. “It’s just you and I. There’s not a sound, and there’s not one sigh. There’s 
     just the beat of my poor heart…”
     LATE NIGHT GRADE HO, Nancy Griiffth: When I wTEL as a kid, and we’d get dressed up, my dad 
     used to tell us we looked like Gretta Garbo. Which was just a thing to say, of course— no real live girl ever 
     looked like Gretta Garbo, but there’s this tender overlay of an extended compliment when I hear this song. And 
     late night, lonesome hotels go with love triangles like peanut butter and jelly.
     OLD PERFUME, Weeping Tile: One of the things I became fascinated with while writing The Arrangement 
     was the perfume reviews of Chandler Burr in T magazine. It’s so hard to describe sensory experiences. It was 
     something Fisher was gifted at, and Burr in another, more fabulous, lforid way. The description that sticks with 
     me was a gentlemen’s scent where “the tar and smoke were transformed into a fascinating manliness with a 
     touch of engine oil, like the cold air clinging to a leather-clad guy who’s just dismounted his Moto Guzzi in 
     December.” Do I know what a Moto Guzzi is? Do I wear perfume myself? I don’t have to.
     ANOTHER ONE GOES B, The Walkmen: AYgain, this is a song that just physically sways you. And that 
     drive of piano keys pushing forward… This is less like the private world Dinah Washington makes and more 
     about taking up your own space, spreading out, that last summer of freedom for Tim and Mary Frances before 
     the war, before the leg, before it all began to come apart. 
     LIVED IN BARS, Cat Power: I listened to this album a lot at the beginning of writing The Arrangement. 
     This song sticks for the throaty bedroom quality of her voice, and the table dancing. I always knew there’d be a 
     table-dancing scene in this book.
     WORK HARD, PLAY HARD, Palace Music: And this is the song that makes me want to make 
     something. Every time I hear it, and for the past 20 years, it just makes me want to write. I hope that feeling 
     never wears thin.
         A conversation with Ashley Warlick,
             Author of The Arrangement
      Q: What inspired you to make M.F.K. Fisher the subject of your novel? 
      I’m a passionate, obstinate home cook, as happy to read a cookbook as a novel. They strike me as fairly 
      equal acts of imagination, and escape. I had always known M.F.K. Fisher’s writing in that light, but quickly 
      came to admire her as a line-by-line stylist. When her ifrst big biography came out (Joan Reardon’s Poet of 
      the Appetites, 2004) I had just ifnished working on my third novel, and I was grateful to fall into the life of 
      someone else.
      Fisher is fascinating and enigmatic, in the way of many who seem to choose themselves as their principal 
      subject. And she was arguably the ifrst woman to write about her own life through the lens of food, at a 
      time when the only outlets women considered in this arena were cookbooks and housekeeping manuals. 
      Even by today’s standards, Fisher’s essays are intimate and sexy, lfirtatious, lush. Her path to ifnding her own 
      voice was instantly compelling. I ifnished the biography and ordered all her books in print.
      Q: Other than reading Fisher’s own writing, how did you research for the book? How much of her 
      story is based on biographical information, and how much is ifctional elaboration? 
      Research can be a slow process of iflling a novel’s pockets with stones. Even as I’d never written historically-
      based ifction before, I knew there’s certain safety in history, and as the idea to use real life as material began 
      to take shape, I knew that I had to be careful. 
      I was also stalled by Fisher’s gatekeepers. Her papers are only available with permission, and when I began 
      the project that would become The Arrangement, they were not available to me. Exclusive rights had 
      already been promised to an author at work on another biography. 
      Initially, this was crushing. There’s an incredible drive to get the details right, and I felt hamstrung by not 
      having everything at my ifngertips. The internet will do that to you, I think. But slowly, as I began to focus 
      more carefully, I understood how this divide was vital. Much of my book is concerned about the boundaries 
      between private and public, truth and invention. It was a line that Fisher skated. Rather than report what I 
      found, I wanted to wring the truth from what she crafted of it.
      One of the things that made this period of her life so compelling was the lack of primary sources. This 
      decade comprises about 40 pages of Reardon’s biography, and it’s not for lack of event or signiifcance. 
      Fisher was a religious keeper of journals, and a beautiful correspondent, but after Tim’s death, a lot of paper 
      went up in lfame.
      Q: The love triangle between Mary Frances, Al, and Tim is very complex. Did you always plan on 
      making these tangled relationships central to the book, or did it grow out of your research? 
      The relationships were what drew me to the story. There’s a famous essay in Serve It Forth called “The 
      Standing and the Waiting” about a meal M.F.K. shared with Chexbres, the name she gave Tim in her 
      writing. After reading her biography, I had a timeline that made for surprising context. This dinner 
      happened on the tail end of Tim and M.F.K.’s interlude in France, and I now understood she would return 
      to Al and her marriage after sharing this moment with her lover, in a Dijon restaurant that was sentimental 
      to her and Al, where they’d celebrated anniversaries, where she had learned about the cuisine that was the 
      basis of her gastronomic education. The understory of that essay is how she’s showing Tim her truest self, 
      but it many ways, it’s also the truest betrayal of her marriage to Al.
      And to further devolve the moment, Tim was instrumental in helping her shape her book. He would have 
      read and commented on this essay while the three of them were living together at Le Paquis…
      And there’s moment after moment like that. I began to see the ways the elasticity of marriage was perhaps 
      for M.F.K. something similar to the elasticity of storytelling. The truth is what you make of it.
      Q: You describe many mouthwatering meals in the book. Are you a good cook? Have you made any 
      of the dishes you write about? 
      I am a dedicated cook. I don’t come from cooks. I come from eaters, and I taught myself to cook at 
      a young age, and I taught myself in part through travel. I recognized this same trajectory in Fisher’s 
      education— her mother, as a late Victorian, hired cooks and Fisher understood the importance of the table 
      as a child, but it was her stretch in Dijon with Al that shaped her life in the kitchen.
      It was my stretch in central Pennsylvania that shaped me. I was newly married, then newly pregnant, and if 
      I wanted Mexican food like the Mexican food I’d had in Mexico, I was on my own. We lived through one 
      winter where it snowed every Wednesday from October through May. I learned how to make tamales, 
      crepes, rilletes, jam, salsa, pastry. And I learned how to immerse myself in cooking. In almost all ways, 
      making a meal is more satisfying than making a book, but it uses the same energy. It’s a wonderfully 
      immediate outlet. 
      I’ve made many of Fisher’s recipes over the last ten years. Her shrimp paste is exceptional. Her description 
      of what she would serve to seduce a lover wonderfully instructive. Her gingersnaps come straight from The 
      Joy of Cooking, but she triples the ginger. I learned that in one of her letters.
      Q: Was it unusual in Fisher’s time to be a woman writing and publishing her own work, particularly 
      about something that would be seen to reside in the “women’s sphere?”
      There were certainly women writing and publishing in the 1930s, when Fisher came of age. However, most 
      women writing about food were writing cookbooks. Fisher was always after something more universal, 
      which I think was unusual. 
      Gender is an interesting question when it comes to Fisher. She told the story several different ways of 
      how her ifrst editors thought her initials represented a man’s name, and how surprised they were to ifnd 
      a woman at the helm of these essays. And yet she would go on later in life to live very independently, to 
      make radically independent decisions when it came to her children, to live with another woman, to go and 
      do and be exactly who she wanted to be at the time. It’s easy for me to imagine she didn’t think about her 
      place as a woman overmuch. She just was.
      Q: The novel’s setting includes Los Angeles, France, and the Swiss Alps. Did you do any traveling to 
      these locations before or while writing the book? 
      I’ve been to all the regions mentioned in the book, but probably sometime in the 1980s. I love to travel, and 
      planned several times to go to Switzerland, to get a clear, ifrst-hand picture of what would have been Le 
      Paquis. But really what I wanted was a picture of a countryside long gone. Old Hollywood, Laguna, even 
      Dijon— none of these places exist as they did for her. I think that lent an inherent sense of longing to the 
      settings of The Arrangement I was lucky to be able to draw upon. 
      Q: This novel has some steamy romantic scenes. How did you approach writing love scenes for such a 
      well-known writer?
      This book was always going to be about sex and food. And that comes straight from Fisher’s writing— her 
      persona on the page is earthy and lfirtatious and sensual, and I think that’s born of the way she sort of 
      sprang into independence with her ifrst book, from her well-heeled, tight knit family, from her marriage to 
      Al. So the approach began, as with all things, with her work itself.
      But too, I understood her relationship with Tim had been a sexual awakening, and that sex was a vital part 
      of their connection, their physical conversation. The scenes between them were effortless to write, and 
      changed little in the process of editing this much-edited manuscript. You know what’s hard? Figuring out 
      what happens before and after. Just what makes a smart woman circle back on an evening and invite herself 
      into the bedroom of a man who’s not her husband? Once she gets there, there’s only one thing left to do.
      Q: You recently opened a bookstore in Greenville, SC. How has this adventure changed your 
      perspective on books and writing? 
      I am terribly proud to be a bookseller. It makes me more sympathetic to everyone involved across the 
      spectrum of publishing. Readers want to be compelled to discover, writers want to be loved, publishers 
      want both these things to happen. It’s the bookseller who’s at the juncture. 
      I’m the buyer for M. Judson. We’re a focused bookstore, and we carry cookbooks and food books, 
      children’s books, and books about the South or written by authors from here, along with a very tight 
      selection of new releases of all kinds.  My job is to ifll a dream bookshelf. 
      At the same time, I now know there’s something on order of 150,000 adult titles published through the 
      usual channels every year.  There was a Tuesday last October that saw the release of 2,000 books. One 
      day! What I choose to represent in my store is vitally important. 
      Q: The book, with its lush settings in Europe and old Hollywood, has a cinematic feel. Can you 
      imagine a movie based on your novel? Who would play Fisher? 
      I think every writer alive has imagined how their book might translate to the movies. And too, I became 
      very interested in the atmosphere in Hollywood at the time, the changes that were shaping that industry, 
      and the ways in which Fisher was living against them. 
      She was such a distinctively beautiful woman. The May Ray photographs of her are just stunning— you can 
      see all that cleverness and tease in her face, her magniifcent eyebrows!
      I think Carrie Mulligan would be a great Fisher, or perhaps Rachel Weisz. Benedict Cumberbatch could be 
      Tim, but I might just be fantasizing now. He has that intensity, and that same off-center attractiveness. Al 
      was handsome and tousled and soft, until he wasn’t. Poor Al. Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
      Q: What do you hope readers will take away from The Arrangement?
      I hope everyone will read The Gastronomical Me. It is a lfat masterpiece of autobiographical storytelling.
