. IMPORTANT  NOTICE  
The AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement  is a user guide  that aims to explain to applicants  
and beneficiaries  the General Model Grant Agreement (General MGA) and the different specific Model 
Grant Agreements (‘Specific MGAs’) for the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for 2014 -2020 
(H2020).  
The purpose of this document is to help users understand and interpret the GAs, by avoiding technical 
vocabulary, legal references and jargon, and seeking to help readers find answers to any practical 
questions they may have about particular parts of the GAs.  
In the same spirit, the document’s structure mirrors that of the GAs. I t explains each GA Article and 
includes examples where appropriate.  
Since the Specific MGAs have a similar set -up and provisions as the General MGA (i.e. they are all 
derived from the General MGA), the annotations will focus mainly on the General MGA (and the 
annotations of the other MGAs will be limited to major differences from that MGA). The key provisions on 
the amount, cost forms and eligibility conditions of your grant are however explained for all MGAs (see 
Articles 4 -6 of each MGA) . 
The annotations are — with some exceptions — done on the multi -beneficiary versions. The multi - and 
mono -beneficiary versions are largely identical.  
Our approach  
1. The text of the article  appears in a grey text box — to differentiate it from the annotations.  
The concepts  that are annotated are in bold and underlined.  
The annotations to the article are immediately underneath.  
Long articles are split into different parts, so the annotatio ns can be placed below the relevant 
parts.  
Examples , best practices  are in bold and green.  
Lists and procedures  are in bold and red.  
Specific  cases  and exceptions  are in bold and orange.  
New explanations (compared to the last update) will be marked with: 
  
New rules  that do not apply to all signed grant agreements (but instead only to those signed 
after a certain version, e.g. version 3.0), will be marked with: 
 and 
  
2. As the AGA intends to be comprehensive, it will cover all possible options envisaged in the 
different GA articles.  
Many of these options may not be relevant to your grant (and will not appear in the grant 
agreement you sign, or will be marked ‘not applicable’).  
The chosen options will appear in italics (without brackets and without the option title), to allow 
you to easily spot that a specific rule applies.  
Updates  
With version 2.0, the AGA was reformatted into a clickab le online version.  
It will be periodically updated with new examples and explanations, based on practical experience and 
on-going developments.

5 The person representing the Commission/Agency must be an author ising officer (by delegation or sub -delegation), designated in 
accordance with document 60008 of 22.02.2001 ‘ Mise en place de la Charte des ordonnateurs ’. 
 
 The term  participant  is used in this document in a wider meaning than in the definition of 
Article 1.1(15) of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 . It covers n ormally 
beneficiaries and linked third parties (and sometimes also other third parties involved in the 
action).

H2020  18 action, comply with their own obligations under the GA and support the 
coordinator in his obligations).  
The signature arrangements  are the following:  
 the coordinator  directly signs the GA  
 the other beneficiaries sign the GA by signing the Accession Form (see Article 56 ).  
Amendments to the GA, if any, will be signed by the coordinator on their behalf.  
Applicant s who accept  the grant (by signing the GA ) become beneficiar ies of the grant and 
are bound by the entirety of its terms and conditions . 
This means that the beneficiaries must:  
 carry out the action  (and especially the research work) as detailed in Annex 1 
(technical implementation) and  
 comply with all the other provisions of the GA and all the applicable provisions  of 
EU, international and national law.  
Other  entities which participate in the action but do not sign the GA (including linked third 
parties , international partners, subcontractors, third parties giving in -kind contributions, etc .) 
are considered as third parties involved in the action  (for the definitions and conditions,  see 
Article s 8 and 9-14a).  
Their involvement in the action varies depending on the role.  
Since there is n o formal contractual link with them , they are formally speaking not bound by 
the terms and conditions of the GA . However , by participating in the action and via the 
obligations on their beneficiary, they are indirectly bound to most of the GA obligations .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Name  and address — Legal entity data   
 The consortium set -up must follow the roles of the GA. Participants should be attributed their roles 
according to their real contribution to the project. The main actors should be the beneficiaries. All other 
roles (third parties) should perform secondary  tasks.  
This means for instance that:  
o linked third parties — are allowed to fully participate in the action, like the beneficiary they are 
linked to; they will therefore be treated for many issues (including cost eligibility; see Article 
6.3) like beneficiaries  
o subcontracting — beneficiaries/linked third parties may NOT subcontract tasks to other 
beneficiaries/linked third parties  (see Article 13 ) 
o coordinator tasks — the key coordinator tasks listed in the GA may NOT be subcontracted or 
delegated to an y other beneficiary  or linked third party  (except, under certain circumstances, 
to an entity with ‘authorisation to administer’ ; see Article 41 .2)  
o in-kind contributions between beneficiaries/linked third parties — if beneficiaries/linked third 
parties give in -kind contributions to other beneficiaries/linked third parties, their cost should  
normally simply be declared by the contributing benefici ary/linked third party (if the 
contributions are particularly important for the project, it may however be advisable  to 
specifically mention them in the description of the action) .  
For an overview on the different types of third parties and their GA roles , rights and obligations, see the 
table in Article 8 . 
 If you are a ‘sole beneficiar y’ (Article 187(2)  Financial Regulation  No 2018/1046 , e.g. European 
Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) or joint venture ) or a ‘beneficiar y without legal personality’ (Article 
197(2)(c) Financial Regulation  No 2018/1046 ; e.g. association ) and will implement the project with the 
help of your members, you should make sure that the members participate as linked third parties, so 
that they will be able to charge their costs to the project.

 CHAPTER 2  ACTION  
ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED [— COMPLEMENTARY GRANT] [ — JOINTLY 
FUNDED ACTION]  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled [insert title of the action ] — [insert  acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in Annex 1.  
[OPTION for complementary grants if foreseen in the work programme : The grant is a  ‘complementary 
grant ’ to [the grant agreement(s) under the call(s) for proposals [ call identifier(s): H2020 — theme —]] [the 
following complementary grant agreement(s) No(s):  
- [insert number ] [insert acronym ] 
- [insert number ] [insert acronym ]].] 
[OPTION for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation) : The action is 
a ‘jointly funded action ’ which must be coordinated with the ‘joint action’  called [ insert the name of the 
third country or international organisation action ], as described in Annex 1. ] 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 2 > Article 2  22  
 
 
RIA, IA and CSA actions are mono - or multi -beneficiary actions.  
They are funded in all Parts  of Horizon 2020 (e.g. H2020 -FETOPEN -2014-2015-RIA; H2020 -
WIDESPREAD -2014-3). 
 
 
2. Complementary grants  
‘Complementary grants ’ are different EU grants which are linked  by the work programme/calls 
by identif ying them  as complementary actions.  
The beneficiaries and those of the complementary grants must cooperate and provide access to 
their results . 
They must conclude a written collaboration agreement  regarding the coordination of the 
complementary grants and the work of the action (see Article 41.4 ). (It covers the case included 
under Special Clause 41  in FP7 .) 
3. Joint ly funded  actions  (‘joint actions’)  
‘Joint actions ’ are the result of  joint or coordinated calls for proposals , launched in parallel by 
the EU and a non-associated third country (i.e. a third country not associated to Horizon 2020) 
or international organisation (in policy areas of common interest and expected mutual benefit 
where there is a clear added value for the EU).4  
For joint calls: the applicants prepare a joint proposal which is submitted to both the EU and 
the third country/IO; the proposals  are evaluated and selected through joint evaluation and 
selection procedures, involving a balanced group of independent experts appointed by e ach 
party.  
For coordinated  calls: the applicants submit separate proposals (to the EU and the third 
country/IO), together with a summary of the work to be done under the coordinated 
proposal . The Commission/Agency will only evaluate the proposals for the EU action ; 
however, t he evaluation may be coordinated  (i.e. include experts from the third country/IO  
use the same  expert panels ; apply the same evaluation criteria , etc.).  
For both types of calls, t he EU participants sign a GA with the EU , while the third country 
participants sign one with their funding agency /IO. The description of the action (Annex 1  of 
the GA ) contains the research carried out under the EU action (but will also include detailed 
explanations about the research to be carried out unde r the third country/IO  action ). 
To ensure coordination, t he participants of the two actions must conclude a coordination 
agreement  (see Article 41.5 ) to link the action s (although legally separate ) and ensure  a 
smooth and successful project implementation.  
 
                                                                                                                                            
infrastructure, and may also include complementary activities of networking and coordination between 
programmes in different countries.  
4  See Article 12 of the Rules for Participation  Regulation No 1290/2013 . 
 The term action  comes from  the Financial Regulation No 966/2012  and means  project . (Previous 
EU Research Framework Programmes used project.)

ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Action s tarting date  
The action starting date  is fixed by the Commission/Agency in the GA.  
It is usually the first day of the month following the date when the GA enters into force. The GA 
enters into force when the last party signs it  (see Article 58 ).  
A fixed starting date may also be agreed between  the Commission/Agency and the c onsortium.  
Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency may agree that the action starts  on another day than 
the first day of the month , if the consortium requests it (usually in i ts proposal) and can show 
that there is a need to start the action at that moment  (e.g. an action that is dependent on 
environmental conditions) .  
That starting date can be either:  
 before the entry into force  of the GA , i.e. before the grant agreement is s igned 
by both parties (retroactive)  
Example: GA signed by the coordinator on 3 0.12.2014. Commission signs on 5.1.2015. The 
action starting d ate would normally be the 1.2.2015, but the consortium  has requested a 
fixed start ing date of 1.9.2014  in its proposal (submitted by the consortium  on 15.5.2014) , 
since the action funded is the continuation of a previous FP7 project. Upon consideration of 
the reasons, this fixed start ing date is approved.  
If the consortium requests  a fixed starting date before the entry into force of the 
GA, it assume s the risks implied by starting the action  before the GA is signed  (in 
particular not being reimbursed for the costs incurred , e.g. if the proposal is not 
successful or that the GA is not signed ). 
 
 
 after the entry into for ce of the GA , i.e. after the grant agreement is signed 
by both parties, but on another day than the first day of the following month   
A starting date fixed  much  later in time (e.g. 2 -3 months after the signature of 
the GA) will have an impact on the timing of the pre -financing payment and will 
delay it.  
 
 
 The action starting date can  NEVER  be before the submission  of the proposal.   
 ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
The duration of the action will be [insert number ] months  as of [OPTION 1 by default:  the first day of the 
month following the date the Agreement enters into force (see Article 58 )] [OPTION 2 if needed for the 
action: [insert date ]]6 (‘starting date of the action ’). 
 
6 This date must be the first day of a month and it must be later than the date of entry into force of the agreement, unless authorised 
otherwise by the authorising officer, if the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the action before the entry into for ce of the grant  
agreement or the need to start the action on another day than the first day of the month. In any case, the starting date should not be earlier 
than the date of the submission of the grant application (Article 130 FR).  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 2 > Article 4.1  24 2. Action duration  
The action duration is fixed by the Commission/Agency in the GA.  
It is expressed as a number of months, running from the action starting date until the end date 
of the action .  
 The action duration relates only to the period during which  the action tasks  (set out in Annex 1) are  
implemented . 
The end date of the action is therefore NOT the same as project closure  or the end of the GA .  
After the end date of the action, the beneficiaries still have to submit their final report and the 
Commission/Agency has to make the payment of the balance. Moreover, certain obligations under the GA 
continue even afterwards.

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Estim ated b udget  
The estimated budget of the action is calculated on the basis of the estimated  eligible  costs 
submitted by the consortium  and is annexed to the GA (Annex 2) .  
These estimated eligible costs are used to determine the ‘maximum grant amount ’ of the action 
(called ‘EU/Euratom financial contribution’ in FP7 projects ; see Article 5. 1).  
Costs of bene ficiaries not receiving EU funding and costs of international partners will be 
indicated in Annex 2, but will not be included in the total eligible costs  and will not count for the 
maximum amount of the grant (see Article 9  and Article 14a ).  
 
2. Budget categories  
The budget categories are listed in Article 6.2  and reflected in the table in Annex 2.  
Budget categories of the General MGA:  
 direct personnel costs  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment  
 costs for SME owners without salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary  
 personn el costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  
 direct costs of subcontracting   ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
party)]  and budget category  (see Articles 5 , 6, [and  14]). [OPTION  to be used if Article 9 or 14a applies: 
It also shows the estimated costs of the beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see  Article 
9)][and][international partners ( see Article 14a )].] 
4.2  Budget transfers   
The estimated budget breakdown indicated in Annex 2 may be adjusted — without an amendment (see 
Article 55) — by transfers of amounts between beneficiaries, budget categories and/or forms of costs set out 
in Annex 2, if the action is  implemented as described in Annex 1.  
However, the b eneficiaries may not add costs relating to subcontracts not provided for in Annex 1, unless 
such additional subcontracts are approved by an amendment or in accordance with Article 13.  
[OPTION  if lump sum  foreseen in Article 5.2 : Moreover,  lump sums set out in Annex 2 can never be 
adjusted. ] 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 2 > Article 4.2  26  direct costs of providing financial support to third parties  (if option applies)  
 other direct costs  
 travel costs and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure  
 indirect costs  
 specific cost  categorie s (if option applies ).  
This budget category (specific cost  categorie s) applies  ONLY  where specific activities are 
reimbursed by unit costs or lump sum costs. For the General MGA , this  is currently the 
case for ‘ access costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure ’, ‘costs 
for energy efficiency measures in buildings’  and ‘costs for clinical studies’.  
 
H2020 >  Chapter 2 > Article 4.2  
3. Budget transfers  (budget flexibility)  
The budget in Annex 2 is an estimation .  
 
 
 
Beneficiaries  may transfer budget among themselves , between linked third parties  or between 
budget categories (without requesting an amendment ; see Article 55 ) and — at the time of 
reporting  — declare costs that are different from the estimated budget.  
 
 
What?  If the incurred eligible costs are lower than the estimated eligible costs, the difference 
can be allocated to another beneficiary or another budget category. The amount reimbursed for 
the other beneficiary (by application of its reimbursement rate) or for the other budget category 
(to which the budget transfer is intended) may thus be higher than plan ned. 
Example: The estimated budget includes personnel costs of EUR 60 000 for beneficiary A and EUR 75 000 for 
beneficiary B. However, at the end of the action, the actual personnel costs of beneficiary A are EUR 75 000 
due to an increase in salaries or to  the need to employ additional personnel to carry out the tasks mentioned in 
Annex 1 while the actual personnel costs of beneficiary B are EUR 60 000. This may be acceptable provided the 
additional costs of beneficiary A fulfil the eligibility requirements  of Article 6  and up to the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1  (at the level of the action).  
Unit costs  — If the GA foresees unit costs, transferring amounts declared as unit costs to other 
categories or other beneficiaries is possible if the actual number of units used (or produced) by 
the beneficiary is less than the number estimated in Annex 2. The cost per unit cannot be 
changed.  
Example:  
Total estimated unit costs for beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (100 units x 100 EUR/unit)  
Total actual unit costs used (or produced) by beneficiary A: EUR 8 000 (80 units x 100 EUR/unit)  
 The maximum g rant amount (see Article 5.1 ) can however NOT be increased . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).  
 Costs for personnel, equipment, goods or services that are in -kind contributions by a third party  (for free or 
against payment) can in practice simply be added to the budget category they correspond to (i.e.  personnel 
costs or other direct costs) — if they comply with the eligibility rules set out in Articles 6  and 11 and 12. 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Budget flexibility  — The budget is in principle flexible  (with the exceptions set out below) .  
Be however aware that the budget table will be used for the calculation of grant reductions (see Article 43 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 2 > Article 4.2  27 Total possible transfer to another budget category: EUR 2 000  
What not?  The GA allows transfers of budget, NOT of tasks.  
Moreover, a  beneficiary can  NOT transfer budget to a form of costs  that it did not set out in its 
estimated budget  — except within the personnel costs  category  and to costs of internally 
invoiced goods and services ( Article 6.2.D.5 ).  
Example  (allowed transfer) : A beneficiary bu dgets all its direct personnel costs as ‘actual costs ’ in the 
estimated budget (column A (a) of Annex 2). However, at the end of the first reporting period, the beneficiary 
declares its direct personnel costs as ‘unit costs determined according to its usual cost accounting practices ’ 
(average personnel costs,  in column A (b) of Annex 2). This is acceptable without an amendment of the GA.  
Example (not allowed transfer): A beneficiary budgets all its costs as ‘actual costs’ in the estimated 
budget. However, at the end of the first reporting period, the beneficia ry wants to declare part of the costs by 
using a specific unit cost allowed in the call (e.g. unit cost for clinical studies). This is NOT possible without an 
amendment of the GA.  
If the budget transfer is due to a significant change in Annex 1, an amendment to the GA is 
needed. A significant change is a change that affects the technical work (‘action tasks’) of Annex 
1.  
Best practice:  The coordinator  can contact the Commission/Agency to ask whether the transfer 
of budget reflects a significant ch ange in Annex 1 which requires an amendment.  
Lump sums  — If the GA provides for a lump sum, the lump sum set out in Annex 2 cannot be 
transferred to another category or to another beneficiary.  
Furthermore, the amount of the lump sum can  never be increased, decreased or split.  
Example: EUR 30 000 lump sum foreseen for travel in Annex 2 (under ‘ other direct costs ’) cannot be turned 
into a EUR 15 000 lump sum for travel and EUR 15 000 for personnel costs   
New subcontracts  — The transfer of budget intended to increase the eligible costs for 
‘subcontracting’ is considered to reflect a significant change of Annex 1 normally requires an 
amendment (unless the beneficiary uses the simplified approval procedure without formal 
amendm ent provided for in Article 13 ).  
Example  (amendment) : Beneficiary A s ubcontract s an action  task during the action implement ation, 
because it decided not to recruit additional personnel as initially foreseen , but to use a subcontractor . It 
requests an ex -ante approval via an amendment (see Article 55 )  
Example (simplified approval procedure):  A beneficiary wants to subcontract a task that originally it was 
going to carry out by itself. It wants to transfer EUR 100 000 from personnel costs to subcontracting. In order 
to make sure that this new subcontracting is possible and its cost is eligible, this will require an amendment to 
the GA before the subcontracting takes place. However, the beneficiar y doesn’t request an amendment, but 
declares the change only with the next periodic technical report (at its own risk). Since the Commission 
approves the report, the costs of the additional subcontract are eligible.  
 
 
 
 Benefic iaries that rely on  the simplified approval procedure  bear the  full risk  of non -approval and 
rejection by the Commission/Agency (see Article 13 ).

grant ’) (see Annex 2).  
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]. 
Eligible costs (see  Article 6 ) must be declared under the following forms (‘ forms of costs ’): 
(a) for direct personnel costs [(excluding direct personnel costs covered by the unit cost[/lump sum] 
under Point (f))]10:  
- as actually incurred costs (‘ actual costs ’) or  
- on the basis of an amount per unit calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual 
cost accounting practices (‘ unit costs ’).  
Personnel costs for  SME owners  or beneficiaries that are natural persons  not receiving a salary 
(see Article 6.2,  Points A.4 and A.5) must be declared on the basis of the amount per unit set out in 
Annex 2a ( unit costs ); 
(b) for direct costs of  subcontracting [(excluding subcontracting costs covered by the unit cost[/lump

2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in "Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and 
Innovation (2014 -2020)" ('Rules for Partic ipation Regulation No  1290/2013 ') (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013 p.81) : ‘innovation action ’ 
means an action primarily consisting of activities directly aiming at p roducing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or 
improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, la rge-scale 
product validation and market replication.

‘access costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructures’; costs for ‘clinical studies’; costs for ‘energy efficiency  
measures in buildings’.  
16 Annex 2a must clearly show, for each beneficiary (and linked third party) concerned, all the parameters for the unit cost (i .e. the unit(s), 
the amount(s) per unit, the research installation/infrastructure for which it is used, the clinical study for which it is use d, etc.).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 5.2  30 In exceptional cases fixed in the work programme /call, lower reimbursement  rates may 
apply.  
As a general principle there is only one funding (reimbursement) rate per action, the same for all 
activities and all beneficiaries of the action  (one project — one funding rate ). 
However, i f non-profit beneficiaries /linked third parties are in the same innovation action  
together with  profit beneficiaries /linked third parties , their eligible costs will be reimbursed 
according to the ir different reimbursement rates.  
The reimbursement rate of a beneficiary does NOT condition the reimbursement rate of its 
linked third parties.  
Example: The beneficiary is entitled to 70 % but it has a linked third party entitled to 100 %. The linked 
third party will have a reimbursement rate of 100 % — despite the lower reimbursement rate of the 
beneficiary to which it is link ed. 
The reimbursement rates apply to all forms of costs (actual, unit, lump sums and flat -rates 
costs)8 and all budget categories .  
 
 
 
3. Cost forms  
The General MGA foresees options for all four cost forms (i.e. actual, unit, flat -rate and lump  
sum costs)9. In practice, they are currently all used, except for lump sums.  
Cost forms of the General MGA:  
 actual costs  (i.e. costs which are real and not  estimated  or budgeted)  for: 
 personnel  costs ( — unless declared as unit cost ; see below ) 
Example:  EUR 62 500 actual yearly salary for senior researcher A  
 subcontracting  costs   
Example:  The actual price paid for the subcontracting of a clinical study  
 costs of providing financial support  to third parties (if option applies)  
Example:  The financial support actually paid to third parties  
 other direct costs (— unless declared as unit cost; see below ) 
Example:  EUR 2  000 actual price for a computer  
 unit costs  (i.e. an amount per unit) for:  
 personnel costs of SME owners /natural persons  not receiving a salary10  
 personnel costs calculated by the beneficiaries in accordance with their usual cost 
accounting practices ( average personnel costs )11 
 costs of  internally invoiced goods and services  calculated by the beneficiaries 
in accordance with  their usual cost accounting practices

 flat-rate costs  (i.e. costs calculated by applying a percentage fixed in advance to other 
types of eligible costs ) for: 
 indirect costs (25% flat -rate for indirect costs ;

 lump sum costs  (i.e. a global amount deemed to cover all costs of the action or a 
specific category of costs).  
Example:  EUR 150 000 to carry out a study within an action  
The General MGA currently does NOT use any lump sum costs .  
Within a grant, different forms of costs can be used.   
Example:  a budget category (e.g. personnel) covered by unit costs and another (e.g. equipment) by actual 
costs.

 5.3  Final grant amount  — Calculation  
The ‘final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action  is implemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions .  
This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  — when the payment of the balance is made (see  
Article 21.4 ) — in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs  
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 — Reduction due to the no -profit rule  
Step 4 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1   Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate(s) (see  Article 5.2 ) are applied to the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs and flat -
rate costs [and lump sum costs] ; see Article 6 ) declared by the beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  (see 
Article 20 ) and approved by the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 21 ). 
5.3.2   Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
will be limited to the latter.  
5.3.3  Step 3 — Reduction due to the no -profit rule  
The grant must not produce a profit.  
 ‘Profit ’ means the surplus of the amount  obtained following Steps 1 and 2 plus the action’s total receipts, 
over the action’s total eligible costs.  
The ‘ action’s total eligible costs ’ are the consolidated total eligible costs approved by the 
[Commission][Agency] . 
The ‘ action’s total receipts ’ are the consolidated total receipts generated during its duration (see  Article 3 ).  
The following are considered receipts : 
(a) income generated by the action; if the income is generated from selling equipment or other assets 
purchased under the Agreement, the receipt is up to the amount declared as eligible under the 
Agreement;  
(b) financial contributions given by third parties to the beneficiary [or to a linked third party]  
specifically to be used for the action, and  
(c) in-kind cont ributions provided by third parties free of charge and specifically to be used for the 
action, if they have been declared as eligible costs.  
The following are however not considered receipts:  
(a) income generated by exploiting the action’s results (see Article 28 ); 
(b) financial contributions by third parties, if they may be used to cover costs other than the eligible 
costs (see  Article 6 );

1. Final grant amount   
The final grant amount will be calculated by the  Commission/Agency — at the end of the action —  
as part of the calculation of the payment of the balance .  
The final grant amount will depend on two types of criteria:  
 work implementation criteria , i.e. was the work carried out as described in Annex 
1 
This is a technical analysis by the Commission/Agency of the work performed during 
the action, as compared with the activities set out in Annex 1 of the GA.  
 financial criteria , including:  
 the amount of eligible costs  
 the reimbursement rates  
 the maximum grant amount  (see Article 5.1 ). 
The procedure for the final payment and detailed calculations are described in Article 21 . (c) financial contributions by third parties with no obligation to repay any amount unused at the end of 
the period set out in Article 3.  
If there is a profit, it will be deducted from the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2.  
5.3.4  Step 4 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irre gularities or fraud  or serious breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43 ), the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the reduced grant amount  
by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fraud  or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1 . 
The final grant a mount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 to 3 or  
- the reduced grant amount following Step 4.

1. Revised final grant amount  
If the Commission/Agency finds — after the payment of the balance  — ineligible  costs,  
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations (and therefore rejects 
costs  and/or reduces the grant ), it will revise the final grant amount, for the beneficiary 
concerned and, if needed, make a recovery . 
The detailed calculat ions are described in Article 21 .  5.4  Revised final grant amount  — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see  
Article 22 ) — the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs (see  Article 42 ) or reduces the grant (see Article 43 ), 
it will calculate the ‘ revised final grant amount ’ for the beneficiary concerned by the findings.  
This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  on the basis of the findings , as follows:  
- in case of rejection of costs : by applying the reimbursement rate to the revised eligible costs 
approved by the [Commission][Agency]  for the beneficiary concerned ; 
- in case of reduction of the grant : by calculating the concerned beneficiary’s shar e in the grant 
amount reduced in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of 
obligations (see Article 43.2 ).  
In case of rejection of costs and reduction  of the grant , the revised final grant amount for the beneficiary 
concerned will be the lower of the two amounts above.

 ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible   
‘Eligible costs ’ are costs that meet the following criteria:   
(a) for actual costs : 
(i) they must be actually incurred by the beneficiary;  
(ii) they must be incurred in the period set out in Article 3, with the exception of costs relating to the 
submission of the periodic report for the last reporting period and the final report (see Article 20 );  
(iii) they must be indicated in the estimated budget set out in Annex 2;  
(iv) they must be incurred  in connection with the action as described in Annex 1 and necessary for its 
implementation;  
(v) they must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts in 
accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the countr y where the beneficiary is 
established and with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices;  
(vi) they must comply with the applicable national law on taxes, labour and social security, and  
(vii) they must be reasonable, justified and must comply with the prin ciple of sound financial 
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency;  
(b) for unit costs :  
(i) they must be calculated as follows:  
{amounts per unit set out in Annex 2a or calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual cost 
accounting p ractices (see  Article 6.2, Point A  and Article 6.2.D.5 ) 
multiplied by  
the number of actual units }; 
(ii) the number of actual units must comply with the following conditions:  
- the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
- the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and  
- the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records 
and documentation (see Article 18 ); 
(c) for flat -rate costs :  
(i) they must be calculated by applying the flat -rate set out in Annex 2, and  
(ii) the costs (actual costs or unit costs [or lump  sum costs] ) to which the flat -rate is applied must 
comply with the conditions for eligibility set out in this Article [;][.]   
(d) [OPTION  if lump sum foreseen in Article 5.2 : for lump sum costs :  
(i) the eligible amount is equal to the amount set out in Annex 2, and  
(ii) the corresponding tasks or parts of the action must have been properly implemented in accordance 
with Annex 1. ]

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.1  37 
 
1. Eligible costs  
The grant can only reimburse  eligible costs  (i.e. costs that comply with the general and 
specific conditions set out in this Article) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a beneficiary declares ineligible costs , the ineligible costs will be rejected and, if 
needed, other measures specified in Chapter 6 (e.g. suspension, termination, grant 
reduction, etc.)  may be taken.  
Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions , applicable per cost  form (see Article 5 ).  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category  (see Article 4 ). 
 
 
 
2. General eligibility conditions f or actual costs  
In order to be eligible , actual costs must be:  
 actually incurred by the beneficiary (i.e.: 
o real and not estimated, budgeted or imputed and  
o definitively and genuinely borne by the beneficiary  (not by any other entity))  
 incurred during the action duration (i.e. the generating event that triggers the costs 
must take place during the action duration)  
The ‘action duration ’ is the period running from the action starting date to the end 
date of the action (see Article 3 ).  
If costs are invoiced or  paid later  than the end date , they are eligible only if the debt 
existed already  during the action duration  (supported by documentary eviden ce) and the 
final cost was known  at the moment of the financial report .  
Costs of services or equipment supplied to a beneficiary (or to its linked third party) 
may be invoiced and paid after the end date of the action if the services or 
equipment were used by the beneficiary (or to its linked third party) during the action 
 ONLY eligible costs  may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4 ) and 
declared  in the financial statements (see Article 20 ). 
Record -keeping & burden of proof  — The burden on proof  for eligibility is on the beneficiaries (and 
linked third parties). They must keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18 ) to show that the 
costs they declare are eligible.  
Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit  by the Commission/Agency. Any 
ineligible costs found will be rejected  (see Article 42 ). 
Cost eligibility is NOT the same as beneficiary/action eligibility. The latter are normally checked 
upstream (before Grant Agreement/Amendment signature ) in order to make sure that only eligible 
beneficiaries/actions are selected for a grant. Loss of eligibility during an ongoing grant normally leads 
to termin ation or change of status (see Articles 50  and 55); costs become automatically ineligible as 
from the date of loss of eligibility . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For a consolidated list of eligibility issue s relating to specific situations/legal framework in individual 
countries , see the List of issues applicable to particular countries . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.1  38 duration.  By contrast, costs of services or equipment supplied after the end of the 
action (or after GA termination ) are not eligible.  
Example:  A conference for which costs are claimed must take place during the action duration.  
 entered as eligible costs in the estimated budget of the action , under the relevant 
budget category (see Annex 2)   
When the final amount of the grant is calculated, the eligible costs cannot include costs 
under budget categories that did not appear in the action estimated budget, unless the 
initial estimated budget was amended or if these additional costs were approved  in 
accordance with Articles 11  to 13.  
Costs included in the estimated budget may be transferred between beneficiaries and 
budget categories without amending the GA under the conditions set out in Article 4.2 . 
 connected to the action as described in Annex 1 (i.e. necessary to achieve the 
action’s objectives)  
The EU/Euratom grant cannot be used to finance activities other than t hose approved by 
the Commission.  
 
 
 identifiable and verifiable  (i.e. come directly from the beneficiary’s accounts (be 
directly reconcilable with them) and supported by documentation)  
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting documents; see 
Article  18) the actua l costs of the work, i.e. what was actually paid for the work (and for 
depreciation costs: what is actually recorded in the beneficiary’s profit and loss 
accounts).  
Costs must be calculated according to the applicable accounting rules of the country in 
which the beneficiary is established and according to the beneficiary’s usual cost 
accounting practices.  
Example:  if a beneficiary always charges a particular cost as an indirect cost, it must do so also for 
H2020 actions, and should not charge it as a direc t cost.  
This may  NOT be used as an excuse  for non -compliance with other GA provisions. A 
beneficiary must make any changes needed  to bring its usual cost accounting 
practices in line with all GA provisions.  
Examples:  conditions for calculation of productive hours (see below) ; conditions  for the eligibility of 
depreciation costs (in line with the international accounting standards, which may deviate from the 
accounting rules of the country)  
 new in Horizon 2020 : Accounting documentation is necessar y only for direct costs. 
Indirect costs do not need supporting evidence because they are declared using a flat -
rate. 
 in compliance with applicable national laws on taxes, labour and social security  
AND 
 reasonable, justified and must comply with the princip les of sound financial 
management, in particular regarding economy and efficiency (i.e. be in line with 
good housekeeping practice when spending public money and not be excessive)  
‘Economy’ means minimising the costs of resources used for an activity (inp ut), while

used to produce them.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.1  39 Examples:   
1. The beneficiary may NOT increase the remuneration of its personnel, upgrade its travel policy or 
its purchasing rules because of the Commission/Agency support . 
2. Entertainment or hospitality expenses (including gifts, special meals and dinners) are generally 
not eligible.  
3. Tips which are not obligatory are not eligible. By contrast, in some countries the invoice of the 
restaurant includes a certain mandatory amount as payment for the ‘service ’. In this case,  the 
amount  may be considered eligible — if the other eligibility c onditions  are fulfilled.  
 
Specific cases  (actual costs) : 
In-kind contributions  free of charge  and costs of linked third parties  — For in -kind 
contributions provided by third parties free of charge and costs of linked third parties, the eligibility 
rules apply mutatis mutandi s (see Article 6.3  and 6.4).  
Thus, the  costs must be : 
 actually incurred by the third part y 
 recorded in the third party’s accounting records  
 calculated  in accordance with the accounting standards applicable in the country in which 
the third party is established  
 calculated according to the third party’s usual cost accounting practices.  
Depreciation costs for equipment used for the action , but bought befor e the action’s start  — 
If the equipment has not yet been fully depreciated according to the beneficiary’s usual cost 
accounting practices, the remaining depreciation costs may be eligible (only for the portion 
corresponding to the action duration and for t he rate of actual use for the action; see Article 6.2.D.2 ). 
Costs related to preparing, submitting and negotiating the proposals  — Cannot be declared as 
eligible for the action (they are incurred before the action starts).  
Costs related to drafting the consortium agreement  — Are not eligible because the consortium 
agreement  should be signed before the action starts. However, costs related to updating the 
consortium agreement are eligible if incurred during the action durati on. 
Travel costs for the kick -off meeting  — Even i f the first leg of the journey takes place before the 
action starting date (e.g. the day before the kick -off meeting) , the costs may be eligible , if the 
meeting is held during the action duration.  
Costs for  reporting at end of the action — Costs related to drafting and submitting the periodic 
report for the last reporting period and the final report are eligible  even if they are incurred after the 
action duration.  
Those costs include the cost of certificates on the financial statements  (CFS)  required by the GA and 
the cost of participating in a final review carried out by the Commission/Agency before the submission 
of the final reports. They may also include the cost of personnel necessary to prepare  the periodic 
report for the last reporting period and the final report. However, t hey do NOT include research or 
innovation activities undertaken after the end date of the action.  
Personnel costs for ERA chairs — Are eligible even if the salary is above national salaries, provided 
that it does not go beyond  normal EU/international salaries for similar positions (since the ERA chairs 
aim to incentivise international mobility for internationally outstanding researchers and research 
managers. When the level of remuneration of the ERA Chair is indicated in Annex 1, this will be duly 
taken into account in case of check s, audits  or reviews . 
Costs to allow for  the participation of disabled people (e.g. costs for sign language interpreters 
required for dissemination events organised under the action)  — May be eligible if they fulfil the 
general and specific eligibility conditions listed under Articles 6.1  and 6.2. The beneficiaries must keep 
records (see Article 18 ) to prove in case of  an audit, check or review the actual costs incurred and 
that they were necessary for the implementation of the action .  
 
3. General eligibility conditions f or unit costs  
In order to be eligible , unit costs must be:  
 calculated by multiplying  the number of actual units  used to carry out the work (e.g. 
number of hours worked on the action, number of tests performed, etc.)  or produced 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.1  40 (e.g. number of square meters for energy e fficiency in buildings)  by the amount per 
unit 
Example:  A Commission decision that sets the amount per unit  for laboratory analyse s at EUR 300 
per test. This amount per unit is also set out  in Annex 2 a.  
 the number of units  must be necessary for the action  
 the units must be used or produced  during the  action  duration   
AND 
 the beneficiaries must be able to show the link  between the number of units declared  
and the work on the action .  
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting eviden ce; see Article 
18) that the number of units declared was actually used for the action . (The actual costs of 
the work  are not relevant .) 
Example: A beneficiary which is a SME declares for its owner who does not receive a salary  300 hours 
worked for an action in 2014. If there is an audit, the SME beneficiary must be able to show a record of 
the number of hours worked by the owner for the action.  
 
Specific case s (unit costs) : 
Costs declared on the basis of the usual accounting practices — For two budget categories (A. 
personnel costs and D.5 costs of internally invoiced goods and services), costs may be declared not as 
a fixed unit cost, but on the basis of the beneficiary's usual cost accounting practices . In this case ,: 
 the beneficiary:  
 must calculate the costs according to its usual accounting practices  
 must budget and declare a total amount  (not the units used)  
 the amount per unit is not  fixed in Annex 2 a. 
Other costs may NOT be declared according to the usual cost accounting practices. For them, the 
amounts per unit will be fixed by the Commission/Agency and set out in  Annex 2 a of the GA  (see 
Article 5.2 ).  
 
4. General eligibility conditions f or flat -rate costs  
In order to be eligible , flat-rate costs must be : 
 calculated by applying a flat rate  to certain  costs  (whether actual, unit or lump  sum 
costs).  
Example (25  % flat rate for indirect costs):  
A SME beneficiary that charges costs of its owner without a salary is working on an innovation 
action and uses the EUR  30 per hour unit cost fixed in Annex 2 for personnel costs. The SME 
beneficiary declares as eligible 300 hours of direct personnel costs for its owner + EUR 1 400 for 
other direct costs + EUR 1 500 for subcontractin g for work in an innovation action during the first 
reporting period.  
Eligible direct costs: (30 X 300 = 9 000) + 1 400 + 1 500 = 11 900  
Eligible indirect cost: 25  % flat -rate of 9 000 + 1 400 (not the 1 500 for subcontracting) = EUR 2 
600 
Total eligible costs: 11 900 + 2 600 = EUR 14 500.  
Reimbursement rate of 70  % (innovation action, ‘for profit’ beneficiary) = EUR 10 150.   
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence ; see Article 
18) that the costs to which the flat -rate is applied  are eligible . (The actual indirect costs are 
not relevant .)

In order to be eligible :  
 the lump sum costs must correspond  to the amount of lump sum  costs set out in 
Annex 2 and  
 the work must have been carried out  in accordance to Annex 1 of the GA.  
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence ; see Article 
18) that the action tasks have bee n carried out as described in Annex 1 . (The actual costs  of 
the work  are not relevant) .

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility  conditions , applicable per budget category.  
For ease of reference, the annotations for  Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget category 
— the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
1. types of costs covered by the budget category  
2. cost form under which the costs must be declared (i.e. actual costs, unit costs, flat ra te)  
3. eligibility conditions  
4. how the costs must be calculated.  
 
2. Direct costs  
‘Direct costs ’ are specific costs directly linked to the perfor mance of the action and which can 
therefore be directly booked to it.  
They are : 
 either  costs that have been caused in full by the activities of the action   6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the  specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. direct personnel costs;  
B. direct costs of subcontracting;  
C. [OPTION 1 to be used if Article 15 applies: direct costs of providing financial support to third 
parties; ] [OPTION 2:  not applicable ;] 
D. other direct costs;  
E. indirect costs;  
F. [OPTION 1 for specific unit[/lump sum] costs : [insert name(s) of specific cost 
category(ies)16]][OPTION 2: not applicable ].  
‘Direct costs ’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation  and can therefore be attributed 
to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see  Point E  below).  
‘Indirect costs ’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed directly to it.  
 
16 Insert precise name of the cost  category ( as in the Commission decision authorising the use of the unit cost /lump sum. For example: 
‘access costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure’ , costs for ‘clinical studies’ , costs for ‘energy efficiency 
measures in buildings’ .

the attribution of which to a single action  can, and has been, directly measured (i.e. 
not attributed indirectly via an allocation key, a cost driver or a proxy).  
The beneficiaries must be able to show (with records and supporting evidence) the link to 
the action . 
 
3. Indirect costs  
‘Indirect costs ’ are costs  that can not be identifi ed as specific costs directly linked to the 
performance of the action.  
In practice, they are costs whose link to the action can  NOT be (or has not been ) measured 
directly, but only by means of cost drivers or a proxy (i.e. parameters that apportion the 
total indirect costs (overheads) among the different activities  of the beneficiary ).  
 
 
 
  In Horizon 2020, indirect c osts are declared  as a 25% fixed flat -rate of the eligible direct costs (minus 
certain direct eligible costs; see Article 6.2.E ).

 A. Direct personnel costs  [(not covered by  Point F)]  
Types of eligible personnel costs   
A.1 Personnel costs  are eligible, if they are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an 
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the action (‘ costs for employees (or 
equivalent )’). They must be limited to salaries (including during parental leave), social security 
contributions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration , if they arise from national law or the 
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act).   
Beneficiaries that are non -profit legal entities17 may also declare as personnel costs additional 
remuneration  for personnel assigned to the action (including payments on the basis of supplementary 
contracts regardless of their nature), if:  
(a) it is part o f the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner 
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required;  
(b) the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the 
beneficiary, r egardless of the source of funding used.  
‘Additional remuneration’ means any part of the remuneration which exceeds what the person would be 
paid for time worked in projects funded by national schemes.  
Additional remuneration for personnel assigned to the  action is eligible up to the following amount:  
(a) if the person works full time and exclusively on the action during the full year: up to EUR 8 000;  
(b) if the person works exclusively on the action but not full -time or not for the full year: up to the 
correspo nding pro -rata amount of EUR 8 000, or  
(c) if the person does not work exclusively on the action: up to a pro -rata amount calculated as follows:  
{{EUR 8 000  
divided by  
the number of annual productive hours (see below)},  
multiplied by  
the number of hours th at the person has worked on the action during the year }. 
 A.2 The costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  with the beneficiary other than an 
employment contract are eligible personnel costs, if:  
(a) the person works under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way 
the work is organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed);  
(b) the result of the work carried out belongs to the beneficiary (unless exceptionally agreed otherwise), 
and 
(c) the costs are not significantly different from those for personnel performing similar tasks under an 
employment contract with the beneficiary.  
A.3 The costs of  personnel seconded  by a third party against payment  are eligible personnel costs if the 
cond itions in Article 11.1 are met.  
 
 17  For the definition, see Article 2.1(14) of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 : ‘non -profit legal entity’ means a legal 
entity which by its legal form is non -profit -making or which has a legal or statutory obligation not to distribute profits to its shareholders 
or individual members .

 A.4 Costs of owners  of beneficiaries that are small and medium -sized enterprises (‘ SME  owners ’), who are 
working on the action and who do not receive a salary are eligible personnel costs, if they correspond to the 
amount per unit set out in Annex 2a multiplied by the number of actual hours worked on the action.  
  
A.5 Costs of ‘beneficiaries that are natural persons ’ not receiving a salary are eligible  personnel costs, if 
they correspond to the amount per unit set out in Annex 2a  multiplied by the number of actual hours worked  
on the action.  
 
[A.6 [ OPTION to be used for trans -national access to research infrastructure: Personnel costs  for 
providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  are eligible only if also the conditions set out in 
Article 16.1.1 are met.] [ OPTION to be used for virtual access to research infrastructure: Personnel costs 
for providing virtual access to research infrastructure are eligible only if also the conditions set out in 
Article 16.2 are met.] ] 
Calculation  
Personnel costs must be calculated by the beneficiaries as follows:  
{{hourly rate  
multiplied by  
number of actual hours worked on the action},  
plus   
for non -profit legal entities: additional remuneration to personnel assigned to the action under the conditions set out 
above (P oint A.1) }. 
The number of actual hours declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see  Article 18 ).  
The total number of hours declared in EU or Euratom grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than 
the annual productive hours used for the calculations of the hourly rate. Therefore, the maximum number of 
hours that can be declared for the grant are:  
{number of annual productive hours for the year (see below)  
minus  
total number of hours declared by the ben eficiary, for that person for that year, for other EU or Euratom grants} . 
The ‘ hourly rate ’ is one of the following:  
(a) for personnel costs declared as actual costs (i.e. budget categories A.1, A.2, A.3 [ and A.6 ]): the hourly 
rate is calculated per full finan cial year, as follows:  
{actual annual personnel costs (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
divided by  
number of annual productive hours}  
using the personnel costs and the number of productive hours for each full financial year covered by th e 
reporting period concerned. If a financial year is not closed at the end of the reporting period, the 
beneficiaries must use the hourly rate of the last closed financial year available.  
For the ‘number of annual productive hours’, the beneficiaries may choose one of the following:  
(i) ‘fixed number of hours’: 1 720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro -rata 
for persons not working full time);  
(ii) ‘individual annual productive  hours’: the total number of hours worked by the person in the 
year for the beneficiary, calculated as follows:

 {annual workable hours of the person (according to the employment contract, applicable collective labour 
agreement or national law)  
plus  
overtime worked  
minus  
absences (such as sick leave and special leave)} . 
‘Annual workable hours’ means the period during which the personnel must be working, at the 
employer’s disposal and carrying out his/her activity or duties under the employment contract, 
applicable collective labour agreement or national working time legislation.  
If the contract (or applicable collective labour agreement or national working time legislation) 
does not allow to determine the annual workable hours, this option cannot be used;  
(iii) ‘standard annual productive hours’: the standard number of annual hours generally applied by 
the beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices. This 
number must be at least 90% of the ‘standard annual workable hours’.  
If there is no applicable reference for the standard annual workable hours, this option cannot be 
used.  
For all options, the actual time spent on  parental leave by a person assigned to the action may be 
deducted from the number of annual productive hours.  
 
As an alternative, beneficiaries may calculate the hourly rate per month , as follows:  
 
{actual monthly personnel cost (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
 
divided by  
 
{number of annual pr oductive hours / 12} } 
 
using the personnel costs for each month and (one twelfth of) the annual productive hours calculated 
according to either option (i) or (iii) above, i.e.:  
 
- fixed number of hours or  
 
- standard annual productive hours.  
 
Time spent on  parental leave may not be deducted when calculating the hourly rate per month. 
However, beneficiaries may declare personnel costs incurred in periods of parental leave in 
proportion to the time the person worked on the action in that financial year.  
 
If parts of a basic remuneration are generated over a period longer than a month, the beneficiaries 
may include only the share which is generated in the month (irrespective of the amount actually paid 
for that month).  
 
Each beneficiary must use only one option  (per full financial year or per month) for each full 
financial year;  
(b) for personnel costs declared on the basis of unit costs (i.e. budget categories A.1, A.2, A.4, A.5 [ and 
A.6]): the hourly rate is one of the following:  
(ii) for SME owners or beneficiaries t hat are natural persons: the  hourly rate  set out in Annex 2a (see 
Points A.4 and A.5 above), or

This budget category applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants under the General MGA.  
An additional option for access to research infrastructure (together with the corresponding 
Article  16 and other provisions) will be inserted into the GA if the action also involves access to 
research infrastructur e. 
The benefici aries may declare the following types of costs  as ‘direct personnel costs’ : 
 costs for  employees (or equivalent):  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs for personnel seconded by a third party  
 costs for beneficiaries that are SMEs for their  owners not receiving a salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons not receiving a salary  
 personnel  costs for providing trans -national or virtual access to research 
infrastructure  (if option applies).  
 
1.1 Direct personnel costs: Employees (or equivalent)  (A.1)  
1.1.1  What?  Personnel costs for employees or equivalent (i.e. persons working for the 
beneficiary on the basis of  an employment contract or equivalent appointing act ) that worked in 
the action.  
 
 (ii) for personnel costs declared on the basis of the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices: the 
hourly rate  calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices,  if:  
- the cost accounting practices used are applied in a consistent manner, based on objective 
criteria, regardless of the source of funding;  
- the hourly rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary ’s 
accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget categories.  
The actual personnel costs may be adjusted by the beneficiary on the basis of budgeted or 
estima ted elements. Those elements must be relevant for calculating the personnel costs, 
reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information;  
and 
- the hourly rate is calculated using the number of annual productive hours (see above).  
 ‘Equivalent appointing  act’ means the appointing acts of civil servants (who do not sign employment 
contract s but receive official nomination s for their post s).

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2. A.1 48  
It covers  (and is limited to):  
 basic remuneration  (i.e. the payments for the employee 's normal work and 
participation in projects — up to what is the beneficiary's usual remuneration practice for 
national projects)  
and, in addition:  
 for non -profit legal entities: additional remuneration  (i.e. e xtra payments made for 
the participation in projects — above the beneficiary's usual remuneration practice for 
national projects).  
 
 
Both basic remuneration and additional remuneration do not only cover the payment itself 
(salary or bonus), but also the social security contributions (mandatory employer and employee 
contributions) , taxes included in the remuneration (e.g. income tax) and other costs and 
payments included in the remuneration (e.g. a fee paid by the beneficiary for a complementary 
health insurance scheme for the employee).  
What not?  Cost of persons  who work for the beneficiary , but NOT with an employment contract 
or equival ent appointing act (e.g. staff provided by a temporary work agency, seconded staff, 
self-employed persons with a direct contract with the beneficiary) . 
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — A contract with a temporary work agency 
qualifies typically as a purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out 
directly some task of the action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting). 
Thus, although NOT eligible as p ersonnel costs, the  costs can be charged under other budget 
categories (i.e. D.3 other goods and services or B. subcontracting), if they comply with the 
eligibility conditions  (e.g. best value for money and no conflict of interest; see Articles 10  
and 13). 
Seconded staff  and self-employed persons with a direct contract  — Can also be 
declared under other categories within the personnel costs (see below, points 1.2 and 1.3) .  
1.1.2 Costs for employees (or equivalent) must be declared  as: 
 actual personnel costs (most common case)  
OR 
 unit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices ( average personnel 
costs; see Article 5.2(a) ). 
1.1.3 The costs for employees (or equivalent) must comply with the following eligibility  
conditions : 
 
 
 National projects  are to be understood in the large sense, meaning all types of projects funded 
under any type of national (public or private) funding scheme  (including projects co -financed by EU 
funds that are managed by the Member States, e.g. regional funds, agricultural and fisheries funds ). 
Projects from EU programmes directly managed by the Com mission/Agencies or their funding bodies 
(e.g. LIFE, ERASMUS, Health, etc .) do not, however, qualify  as national projects (but as 
EU/international projects).  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  ONLY costs for personnel  assigned to the action  (i.e. working for the action according to internal written 
instructions, organisation chart or other documented management decision) can be eligible. Reliable time 
records will normally be sufficient proof of the assignment to the action  — unless there is  other contradicting 
evidence (e.g. the employment contract indicates that the person was hired to work on another project)   
 
.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  49 For basic remuneration : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action 
duration, necessary, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and (b) )  
Payment s of dividends to employees (profit distribution) are NOT eligible under Article 
6.5(a)(i) . However, bonuses  based on the overall financial performance  of the 
organisation  (e.g. profitability or surplus ) may be accepted , if they fulfil the conditions 
set out  below , i.e. as part of the usual remuneration practices for national projects and 
thus eligible as basic remuneration .  
Examples ( positive ): 
If the profit of the company  at the end of the year is more that x € (or more than x %), each 
employee will receive a bonus of z % of his/her basic remuneration  (or a fixed bonus  of x € more as 
part of the gross salary) .  
Examples ( negative ): 
If the profit of the company at the end of the year is more that X €  (or more than X %) , z % of that 
profit will be distributed to employees trough extra remuneration . 
Any part of the remuneration which is based on  commercial targets or fund raising 
targets is NOT eligible  (because n either incur red in connection with the work described in 
Annex 1 of the action nor necessary for its implementation ). 
Example s: x € for reaching a sales target; x % on sales; x € premium per externally funded project 
gained; x % of the external funding gained  
 be paid in accordance with national law, the collective labour agreement and the 
employment contract/ equivalent appointing act  
Examples:   
1. The collective labour agreement establishes that all researchers may receive a bonus  between EUR 
100 and EUR 200 pe r month based on their seniority.  
2. The national law authorises public universities to pay a bonus  based on merit of the employees.  
3. The contract fixes a premium of EUR 1  000 for each research paper published in peer -reviewed 
international research jou rnals.  
 exclude arbitrary bonuses  (i.e. bonuses  which are not part of the beneficiary's  usual 
remuneration practices and/or which are not based on objective conditions ). 
For additional remuneration  (in addition to the conditions above ): 
 be a non-profit legal entity   
 be paid for the performance of additional work  or different expertise than his/her 
usual tasks  
This is usually the case, since additional remuneration aims precisely to reimburse the 
additional work/expertise that is required for E U and international projects.  
 be consistently applied  whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required  and 
regardless of the source of funding  used 
The additional remuneration may not differ according to where  the funds come from. In 
particular, it cannot be set up for actions funded by a specific donor ; additional 
remuneration schemes that are applicable only to EU projects are not acceptable.  
Example (not acceptable): All professors carrying out research will be paid 10  % more when 
they work on EU-funded actions.  
Also, they may not be subject to budget availability (i.e. only to be paid if there is 
remaining funds in the project budget).

working in the same project  (provide d that objective criteria are used to determine the 
differences) . 
 
 
 
 
Specific cases  (direct personnel costs  for employees (or equivalent)  (A.1) ): 
Teleworking — Remuneration costs of personnel  not working on t he premises of the beneficiary ( i.e. 
teleworking ) may be accepted as eligible , if it is the beneficiary’s usual practice (i.e. if clear rules are 
available). The system in place must make it possible to both identify and record the hours worked for 
the action . 
Benefits in kind — Costs of benefits in -kind provide d by the beneficiary to its personnel (e.g. costs 
of a company car made available to certain categories of employees for their own use)  or of quasi -
financial benefits (e.g. costs of lunch vouchers) may be accepted as eligible , if they are justified and 
registered as personnel costs in conformity with the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices. Like 
all costs, they must fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6 . 
Recruitment costs — Recruitment costs are  generally  NOT eligible as direct costs, because the 
beneficiary is required to have the necessary human resources  to implement the action . If a 
beneficiary needs to recruit additional personnel during the action, the related costs would be 
considered part of the en tity’s normal indirect costs, which are covered by the 25 % flat -rate.  
Costs for students , PhDs and other researchers  under scholarship, internship or similar 
agreement s (not employees) — Costs of students  that work for the beneficiary  can be  accepted , if 
the agreement is work -oriented (not training -oriented : i.e. not aimed at helping the student to 
acquire professional skills ).  
PhD agreements will be considered work -oriented. However, time for training, if any, may NOT be 
charged to the action.  
Fellowshi ps/scholarship s/stipends  — Can be charged to the action (as personnel costs), if 
they fulfil the conditions set out Article 6.1  and  6.2.A.2 , and in particular : 
 the remuneration complies with the application national law on taxes, labour and social 
security  
 the assignment of tasks respect s the laws in force in the country  of the beneficiary  
 the students have the necessary qualifications to carry out  the tasks allocat ed to them 
under  the action.   
Cost for e xemption s from a cademic fees — The fees (or part of them) are eligible as 
personnel cost , if the student’s contract include s the amount of waived fees as part of his/her 
remuneration. The other conditions set out in Article 6  have to be fulfilled as well (e.g. the full 
remuneration, included the value of the waived fees, must be recorded in the university’s 
accounts) .  
Parental leave — Salaries and social security contributions paid during  parental leave (either 
maternity leave or parental leave) are eligible as part of the basic remuneration only if:  
 they are mandatory under national law , under the relevant collective labour agreement (e.g. 
statutory maternity pay ) or under the employment contract  
 the beneficiary has actually incurred them  
 they are not reimbursed by national (central,  regional or local) authorities (i.e. only the net 
amount s paid by the beneficiary are eligible) .  
Costs related to public officials — For public bodies, the  costs related to public officials paid 
directly from central, regional or local government budgets may be considered eligible, if they fulfil 
the conditions set out in Article 6  (applied to the central, regional or local gover nment employing the 
public officials). In this case , the public officials will be considered as in -kind contributions (resources 
made available) provided by a third party (the government) free of charge  (see Article 1 2). 
Supplementary contracts  — Supplementary contracts  for participation in projects (whatever their 
form) are acceptable if it is the beneficiary’s usual practice and compatible with  national law. The 
remuneration will be qualified as basic or additional remu neration, depending on the scope (national 
  8000 EUR c eiling — Additional remuneration is eligible ONLY up to  a ceiling of 8000 EUR annual 
costs; see point  1.1.4 ).

projects).  
 
1.1.4 The costs  must be calculated  as follows:  
In general, personnel costs for H2020 actions are calcula ted (for each person assigned to the 
action, including persons working exclusively on the action) as follows:  
 
 
In practice, the calculation will differ (per type of beneficiary/employee) depending on  the 
remuneration practices  of the beneficiary : 
Case 1 : beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as actual costs  
Case 1A : employee whose remuneration is not project -based (i.e. same 
remuneration, regardless if they are involved or not in specific projects)  
Case 1B : employee whose remuneration is project -based (i.e. different remuneration 
levels, depending on whether they work  in specific projects or not)  
Examples:  
1. The beneficiary and the researcher sign a separate employment contract for the work of the 
person in the Horizon 2020 action. The hourly rate resulting from that additional employment 
contract is different from th e hourly rate of the other employment contract of the person with the 
beneficiary.  
2.The beneficiary has a remuneration scheme which includes the payment of a bonus for work in 
specific projects. The bonus is paid as part of the total salary of the person in addition to the 
basic salary and other general bonuses.  
3. The employment contract of the person fixes a specific hourly rate to be paid for work in 
specific projects. This hourly rate replaces the standard salary of the person while it works in 
those p rojects.  
Case 2 : beneficiaries declaring personnel costs as unit costs in accordance with the usual 
cost accounting practices ( average personnel costs).  
Additional remuneration is in practice an issue ONLY for case 1B beneficiaries. All other 
beneficiaries will automatically fall under ‘basic remuneration only’ and therefore are not 
concerned by the provisions on additional remuneration.    
Case 1B benefic iaries need to differentiate between payments that are basic remuneration and 
payments that are additional remuneration. For them, the hourly rate charged to the action 
must be calculated using only basic remuneration (i.e. excluding any part that qualifie s as 
additional remuneration). Additional remuneration may be charged (separately and on top), if 
the beneficiary is a non -profit entity, if th at remuneration is eligible and only up to a ceiling of 
8000 EUR per year.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  52  
How to calculate  direct personnel costs  for employees (or equivalent) : 
For case 1A beneficiaries (actual costs, not project -based remuneration): 2 steps  
Step 1 —  Calculation of the hourly rate  (for each employee ) 
The beneficiary must calculate, for each employee, the hourly rate  to be charge d to 
the action  by using one of the following methods:  
 per full financial yea r (main method ): single hourly rate for each  person for 
each full financial year  
 per month (alternative method): one hourly rate for each  person for each  
month  (i.e. 12 hourly rates per person for each financial year ). 
Each beneficiary may choose any of the two options. However, the option chosen 
must be applied during the full financial year to all its personnel in all H2020 
grants. If the beneficiary wants to change option, it can do so for the next financial 
year ( — again for all its personnel in all its H2020 grants).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Recalculations & adjustments of financial statements (exceptional)  — To 
benefit from this new option (i.e. hourly rate per month) beneficiaries may apply it 
retroactively for all grants on -going (i.e. for which the final report has not been 
submitted) on 20 July 2016 (i.e. date of adopti on of the H2020 MGA version 3.0). The 
beneficiary may re -calculate costs already declared on the basis the full financial year by 
using the monthly calculation method. However, in that case it must do the recalculation 
for ALL personnel costs declared for that/those financial year(s) in ALL on-going H2020 
grants. The beneficiary must declare the differences, either positive or negative, as 
adjustments in the next reporting period.  
 The grant agreement formulas  for the hourly rates are mandatory . Those 
formulas may lead to minor/temporary differences with the personnel cost recorded in 
the accounts. Those differences have no impact on the eligibility of the costs , provided 
that the formula ha s been correctly applied and  that the double ceiling  explained above 
has been respected.  
  ONLY hours actually worked on  the action  can be counted. Such hours must be 
registered via time records or, if the person works exclusively in the action, via a declaration 
(see Article 18.1.2 ). 
  Double ceiling — Beneficiaries must  ensure that:  
 the total number of hours  worked declared  in EU and Euratom grants for a person 
for a year is NOT higher than th e number of annual productive hours  used for the 
calculation of the hourly rate (see below)  
Example:  Beneficiary using 1 720 as annual productive hours. According to the time-records, 
during the financial year 2017 employee Z worked 900 hours in a H2020 action and 900 
hours in another EU project. The total hours worked for EU projects by employee Z would 
therefore be 1 800 (900 + 900). However, the beneficiary cannot declare more than 1 720 
hours, since this  is the number of annual productive hours it used for the calculation of the 
hourly  rate. Therefore, for 2017 , the beneficiary can only charge 820 hours to the H2020 
action  (i.e. 1 720 – 900 hours declared to other EU grant) , even if  the person worked 900 
hours in the action.  
 the total amount of  personnel costs  declared  (for reimbursement as actual costs) in 
EU and Euratom grants for a person for a year  is NOT higher than the total personnel 
costs recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts  (for that person for that year ). 
Example:  The total personnel costs recorded in the 201 7 accounts of the beneficiary for 
employee Z is EUR 18 000. The beneficiary already declared EUR 9 000 to the other EU  grant. 
The hourly rate for employee Z according to  the formula in the H2020 Grant Agreement is 11 
EUR/hour and employee Z worked 900 hour s for the action in 2017. The eligible personnel 
costs for the H2020 action would  therefore  be: 11 EUR/hour x 900 hours =  EUR 9 900. 
However, since the beneficiary already declared EUR 9 000 to the other EU grant, the 
maximum that it can declare to the H2020 action is: EUR 18 000 (total personnel costs for 
employee Z) – EUR 9 000 (already declared to other EU grant) = EUR 9 000. The beneficiary 
can therefore declare only EUR 9 000 , even if  the result of the formula for personnel costs 
would be EUR 9 900 .

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  53  
Calculation of the hourly rate per full financial year  
Annual  hourly rate s must be calculated as follows:  
for each person:  
{actual annual personnel costs  for the person  
divided by  
number of annual productive hours }. 
The rate must be calculated by full financial  year (i.e. the 12 -month period covered 
by the annual accounts  of the entity ).  
Example:  When the financial year matches the calendar year , i.e. 1st January – 31st 
December, the hourly rate for the hours worked in 2014 will be calculated using the 
personnel costs and the productive hours from January to December 2014.  
When at the end of  the reporting period there are months for which the financial 
year is not closed  yet (e.g. the financial year is still on -going ; necessary 
information  for that year is  not yet available, etc.), the beneficiar y must use the 
figures of the last closed financial  year available to declare th e costs for those 
months  (i.e. use the hourly rate of the last closed financial year available also to 
calculate the personnel costs for the hours worked on those months ).  
Example:  Action with 1 reporting period of 18 months from 1.10.201 5 to 31.3.201 7. 
The beneficiary ’s financial year closes on 31 December of every year.  
Calculation of the hourly rate:  
For hours worked on the action from 1.10.2015 - 31.12.2015: the hourly rate of 
2015 must be used; i.e. hourly rate calculated on the basis of the annual personnel 
costs and annual productive hours of the closed financial year 2015.  
For hours worked on the action from 1.1.2016 – 31.12.2016: the hourly r ate of 2016 
must be used; i.e. hourly rate calculated on the basis of the annual personnel costs 
and annual productive hours of the closed financial year 2016.  
For hours worked on the action from 1.1.2017 – 31.3.2017: the hourly rate 
calculated for the las t closed financial year available must be used, e.g. the one of 
the year 2016. Therefore, the beneficiary will not calculate another hourly rate for 
the period from 1.1.2017 - 31.3.2017. Instead, it will simply continue applying the 
hourly rate calculated for 2016 for the hours worked in 2017 until 31.03 .  
Last closed financial year available refers to the most recent full financial year for 
which all information necessary to calculate the hourly rates in accordance with 
the GA is available  at the end of th e reporting period . Therefore, it is NOT 
necessary to wait until the annual accounts have been audited.  
Financial year different from fiscal year — If the financial year is different 
from the fiscal year  (i.e. the 12 -month period used to calculate the income taxes) , 
the entity may use the fiscal yea r instead of the financial year for calculating the 
hourly rate. The method must however be consistently applied and can NOT be 
changed within the same grant.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  54  
The annual personnel costs may include only eligible personnel costs.  
Any part of the remuneration which is paid once a year (e.g. holiday pay)  will be 
taken into consider ation for the hourly rate of the year in which it was  accrued in 
the accounts.  
For calculating the annual productive hours , the beneficiary must use one of the 
following three options:  
 option 1:  1 720 hours for pers ons working full time (or corresponding pro -
rata for persons not working full time) (‘ 1720 fixed hours ’) 
 option 2:  the total number of hours worked by the person in the year for the 
beneficiary  (‘individual annual productive hours ’)  
 option 3:  the ‘standar d number of annual hours’ generally applied by the 
beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting 
practices  (‘standard annual productive hours ’). 
In principle, t he same option (1, 2 or 3)  must be applied to all personnel  working 
in H2020 actions. However , the beneficiary may use different options for different 
types  of personnel , if: 
 the same option is applie d at least per group of personnel  employed under 
similar conditions (e.g. same staff category, same type of contract, same 
cost-centre, etc.) and 
 the options are applied consistently (e.g. the choice of the option is not 
changed ad-hoc for specific employees) . 
The beneficiary must keep the same option(s) for the full financial year . It can 
only change its option (s) for the next financial year.   
  Recalculations & adjustments  of financial statements ( exceptional)   — 
Adjustments to the hourly rate are normally  allowed ONLY for mistakes (e.g. incorrect 
accounting information; error in the calculation; etc .) and must be done using the hourly 
rate which would have had to be used at the end of the reporting period concerned.  
Example s:  
1. An internal audit on the annual accounts of the beneficiary finds later errors in the 
accounting information  used to calculate the hourly rates.   
2. Reporting period 1 runs from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017. The beneficiary used the 
hourly rate 2016 for the entire period (i.e. also for the part from 01/01/2017 – 
30/06/2017) because the financial year 2017 was still on -going at the end of the reporting 
period . In 2018, the beneficiary realises that the 2016 hourly rate was incorrectly 
calculated and that it has to declare an adjustment for reporting period 1. To calculate the 
adjustment, the beneficiary must use  the correct hourly rate for 2016 for the whole 
reporting period 1, including the period from January to June 2017.   
Otherwise, costs that have already been declared can normally NOT be adjusted/changed 
(even if a recalculation of the hourly rate after the  closure of the financial year would give 
another result).

Calculation of the hourly rate per month  
Monthly hourly rate s must be calculated as follows:  
for each person:  
{actual monthly personnel costs   
divided by  
{number of annual productive hours/12 }}. 
The rate must be calculated for each  month . 
The monthly personnel costs may include only eligible personnel costs.  
If a part of the remuneration is generated over a period longer than a month (e.g. 
the thirteenth salary) , only the entitlement generated in the month can be included 
in the monthly personnel costs (— irrespectively of how much is  actua lly paid in that 
month ). 
Example:  
In accordance with the collective labour agreement , Ms T is entitled to a thirteenth salary 
(another full month salary in addition to her 12 monthly salaries ) to be paid in July  each 
year. The monthly salary of MS T is EUR 3 000.  
The monthly personnel costs in July  will be:  
EUR 3 000 + {EUR 3 000 / 12} = 3 000 + 250 = EUR 3  250 
The beneficiary can therefore NOT include the total of the thirteenth salary in the 
personnel costs for July , but must distribute it over the months in which it was generated 
(in this example 1/12 per month). Otherwise, the hours of July would be incorrectly priced 
at the double of the hours worked in  normal months.  
 Absences & overtime — 
Absences : the three options treat absences (leave) in different ways:  
 under option 1 (1720 fixed): ONLY actual time spent on parental leave (maternity and parental 
leave) may be deducted from the 17 20 fixed hours. NO other leave (e.g. sick leave, special leave, 
annual leave, etc.) can be deducted.  
 under option 2 (individual): the beneficiary must deduct all leaves (i.e. actual time  on sick leave, 
parental leave or special leave, etc.) to calculate the annual productive hours.  
 In order to calculate the annual workable hours, the beneficiary has to deduct the annual 
leave entitlement (see example i n the table of options ). However, i f the employment contract 
allows end -of-year transfers for leave entitlements (i.e. the days not taken one year can be 
taken the next one; days not taken are not paid out), the beneficiary may opt for deducting 
instead actual time  of annual leave (if this is done consistently throughout the years).  
 under option 3 (standard): the standard annual productive hours defined by the beneficiary normally 
take into account the standard time of absence in the organisation. However, the beneficiary may 
deduct on top the actual time spent on parental leave (maternity and parental leave) by the 
individual employee.  
Overtime : all three options include potential overtime in the annual productive hours, either implicitly 
(options 1 and 3) or explicitly (option 2):  
 under o ption 1  (1720 fixed) : NO overtime may be added to the 1720 fixed hours  
 under option 2  (individual) : all overtime worked (paid or unpaid) must be added to the annual 
workable hours  to calculate the annual productive hours  
 under option 3  (standard) : the stan dard annual productive hours defined by  the beneficiary normally 
take into account the standard overtime hours in the organisation (if any).   
  No impact on the hours worked  — The rules on the calculation of the hourly rate have no impact on 
the hours that can be declared as hours worked on the action . ALL hours  worked on the action  can be 
declared (normal hours and overtime ) and  all at the same hourly rate .  
However,  beneficiaries must make sure that they don’t reach th e double ceiling  (i.e. number of annual 
productive hours used and costs recorded in accounts; see above) . If the overtime results in more hours 
worked /more costs declared over the ceiling , the exceeding can  NOT be charged to the action  (they must be 
capped  at the ceilings ).

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  56  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For calculating the annual productive hours , the beneficiary must use one of the 
following two options (see the table of options above for the details on each option) : 
 option 1:  1 720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro -rata 
for persons not working full time) (‘ 1720 fixed hours ’) 
 option 3:  the ‘standard number of annual hours’ generally applied by the 
beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting 
practices  (‘standard annual productive hours ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In principle, the same option (1 or 3) must be applied to all personnel  working in 
H2020 actions. However, the beneficiary may use different options for different 
types of personnel, if:  
 the same option is applied at least per group of personnel employed under 
similar conditions (e.g. same staff category, same type of contract, etc.)  
and 
 the options are applied consistently (e.g. the choice of the option is not 
changed at -hoc for specific employees) . 
The beneficiary must keep the same option(s) during the entire  financial year . It 
can only change its option(s) for the next financial year.  
  Recalculations & adjustments  of financial statements ( exceptional)  — If a 
later event (e.g. the unexpected leave of the employee)  means that the payment s made 
for the employee are actually lower (i.e. that the monthly hourly rates were overstated ) 
the beneficiary must recalculate the hourly rates with the correct amount . If some of  the 
related personnel costs were already declared, the beneficiary must declare  the difference 
as adjustment in the n ext reporting period.   
If the monthly entitlement of an extra salary is not known in advance (for example for an 
annual merit pay whose amount is decided in December  — if eligible as basic 
remuneration —) the beneficiary cannot take into account the extra salary until the 
amount is known . It may therefore recalculate the hourly rates at that moment and, if 
needed, declare the difference as adjustment in the next reporting period.  
 
Beneficiaries  may re -calculate costs already declared on the basis the new monthly 
calculation method , provided that it is done for  all personnel costs declared for th e 
financial year(s) AND for all (on-going ) H2020 grants. The beneficiary can declare the 
differences (either positive or negative ) as adjustments in the next reporting period.  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Option 2 can NOT be used for monthly hourly rates because the individual annual 
productive hours — and thus also the monthl y hours, i.e. 1/12  of the annual  — are known 
only at the end of the financial year. It would be therefore impossible to calculate the 
hourly rates at the end of each month .

Step 2 —  Multiplying the hourly rate s by the hours worked on the action  
The hourly rate for the employee must be multipl ied by the number of hours  s/he 
actually worked  on the action  and this gives the amount that can be charged to the 
action . 
 
For case 1B beneficiaries (actual costs, project -based remuneration): 4 steps  
Step 1 — Checking the nature of the remuneration (basic or additional ) for each 
employee)  
The beneficiary must first find out, for each employee, if the remuneration it is paying is 
all basic remuneration or contains also additional remuneration.  
To do this, the beneficiary must calculate two reference hourly rates : 
 reference rate for the work on the H2020 action ( ‘action reference ’) 
and 
 reference rate for the usual remuneration practice for national projects 
(‘national projects reference ’). 
If the action reference is equal or below  the national projects reference, the 
remuneration is all basic remuneration. If it is higher , the exceeding part is additional 
 Absences & overtime — 
The same rules on the treatment of absences and overtime apply as for annual  hourly 
rates, except that  time spent on parental leave  can NOT be deducted from the annual 
productive hours . 
However, beneficiaries may charge to the action the costs incurred for parental leave (as 
personnel costs ) in proportion to the time the person worked for the action during the 
financial year  (time worked on the action over total producti ve hours for the year) . This 
must be done separately and on top of the personnel costs declared by multiplying the 
hours worked for the action by the monthly hourly rates . 
Example:  
In 2015 Ms T has been five months in parental leave. During that time the s ocial security 
reimbursed to the beneficiary 50 % of her salary. Her monthly salary was EUR 3 000 
(reimbursement EUR 1  500). The beneficiary used option 1 (1720 fixed hours) for the 
annual productive hours and Ms T worked in 2015 320 hours on the H2020 act ion.  
Personnel costs incurred during parental leave= {EUR 3 000 x 5} - {EUR 1 500 x 5} = 15 
000 – 7 500 = EUR 7 500  
(Note: amounts reimbursed to the beneficiary by the social security are not actual costs for 
it and, therefore, must be deducted)  
Proportion of time worked for the action in 2015 = Time worked for the action / Total  
productive hours  excluding the parental leave = 320 / {1720 - {1 720 x 5/12}} = 320 / {1 
720 – 716,7} = 320 / 1 003,3 = 31,89 %  
Cost of parental leave for the H2020 action = EUR 7 500 x 31,89 % = EUR 2 391,75  
 No impact on the hours worked  — The rules on the calculation of the hourly rate  
have no impact on the hours that can be declared as hours worked on the action . ALL 
hours  worked on the action  can be declared (normal hours and overtime ) and  all at the 
same hourly rate .  
However,  beneficiaries must make sure that they don’t reach the double ceiling  (i.e. 
number of annual productive hours used and costs recorded in accounts; see above) . If 
the overtime results in more hours worked /more costs declared over the ceiling , the 
exceeding can  NOT be charged to the action  (they must be capped  at the ceilings ). The 
ceilings apply per full financial year, not per month.  
However, do not forget that your personnel costs must comply with national labour law.   
Example : 
If the national law provides for a prohibition for employees to work more than 48 hours per 
week, it is not possible to charge to the H2020 action 250 hours in a month for an  
employee.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  58 remuneration and must be taken out for the calculation of the hourly rate to be charged 
to the action.  
Step 1a — Calculation of  the reference hourly rates  
For the action reference : the beneficiary must calculate an hourly rate (either annual  
or monthly ) based on the remuneration paid to the employee for his/her work in the 
H2020 action.  
For annual  reference rates:  
{annual personne l costs for the person for his/her work in the action  
divided by  
number of hours worked for the action in the financial year }.  
If the reporting period ends before the end of the financial year, the beneficiary 
must use the personnel costs and the hours f rom the beginning of the year until 
the end of the reporting period.  
For monthly  reference rates:  
{monthly personnel costs for the person for his/her work on the action  
divided by  
number of hours worked for the action in the month }.  
For the national project s reference : the beneficiary must calculate an hourly rate 
based on either:  
 regulatory requirements (e.g. national law or collective labour agreements)  
setting up the level of remuneration to be paid for work in projects funded 
under national scheme s — if those amounts were actually paid at least once 
before the submission of the H2020 proposal for work in a national project  
Example:  The national law establishes that the maximum monthly salary of engineers 
acceptable for national grants is EUR 4 000.  Beneficiary A has paid that salary to its 
engineers while working in national grants. Beneficiary B has signed a collective labour 
agreement whereby the monthly salary to be paid for work under national grants is fixed 
at EUR 3 500. Beneficiary B has paid  that salary to its engineers working in national 
grants.  
Maximum amount acceptable as basic remuneration for beneficiary A = EUR 4  000/month 
for a person working full -time. If the remuneration of the person for the work in the 
H2020 action is more than th is ceiling, the excess will qualify as additional remuneration.  
Maximum amount acceptable as basic remuneration for beneficiary B = EUR 3  500/month 
for a person working full -time. If the remuneration of the person for the work in the 
H2020 action was more than this ceiling, the excess will qualify as additional 
remuneration.  
 internal rules setting up the level of remuneration to be paid for work in projects 
funded under national schemes — if those amounts were actually paid at least 
once before the submissi on of the H2020 proposal for work in a national project  
Example:  The internal rules of University Z provide that a professor working in 
externally -funded projects may get an extra salary of up to 50 % for the time its works 
for those projects. The maximum extra salary University Z has actually paid for work in 
national projects was 30 %.  
Maximum amount acceptable as basic remuneration = salary of the person + 30 % (for 
the time worked in the H2020 action). If the remuneration of the person for the work in 
the H2020 action is more than this ceiling, the excess will qualify as additional 
remuneration.  
or 
 if none of these are available  or if the beneficiary never had any national 
projects  before the submission of the H2020 proposal : the average 
remuneration of the employee in the previous financial year.  
The hourly rate of the national project reference must be calculated using 1720 
fixed annual productive hours (unless there is an hourly rate directly set in the law, 
collective la bour agreement or internal rules).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  59 For the average remuneration of the employee, the beneficiary must moreover 
exclude remuneration that came from H2020 actions ; i.e.: 
{total annual personnel costs* for the person for year n -1 excluding remuneration 
paid for work in H2020 actions  
divided by  
1720** minus hours worked in H2020 actions in year n -1} 
* The total annual personnel costs include all remuneration paid by the beneficiary to 
the person for work, irrespectively of the tasks of the person and the proj ects for 
which the person was working; but excludes all remuneration paid for work in H2020 
actions. If the remuneration included ineligible items (e.g. profit distribution)  those 
must also be removed.   
** 1720 is the fixed number of annual productive hour s. The beneficiary must remove 
from those annual productive hours the hours worked in H2020 actions. If in year n -1 
the person worked exclusively in H2020 actions, the beneficiary must use the average 
salary of the last year in which the person did not wor k exclusively in H2020 actions 
(e.g. year n -2 or year n -3). If in year n -1 the person was on long -term sick leave,  the 
beneficiary may use the average of year n -2 (instead of n -1). 
If the national law or the internal rules set up different levels of remuneration for 
different categories of staff, the reference will be the one of the category to which 
the person belongs.  
If the national law or the internal rules set up different remuneration levels for 
different types of national projects (or for diffe rent work within the projects), the 
reference will be the one applicable to the type of project/work that is closest to the 
H2020 action.  
Example:  The internal rules of University Z provide that a professor working in basic 
research projects will receive 1 0 % extra salary; while a professor working in applied 
research projects will receive 15 % extra salary. Both extra salaries are systematically 
paid also for projects funded by national schemes. The H2020 action is an innovation 
action. The reference that would apply in this case is the extra salary for applied research 
projects (15 %) as the type of project is closer to the H2020 innovation action than basic 
research projects.  
The beneficiary must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence to support the act ion and 
national project references used (see Article 18 ).  
Example:  If the beneficiary uses the internal rules it must keep documental evidence of the 
internal rules applied, the category of the person (if applicable), and the  payslip and payment 
documents proving that such remuneration was paid at least once prior to the submission of 
the proposal.  
Step 1b —  Comparing the action reference with the national project reference  
If the action reference is higher than the national project reference, the exceeding part 
is additional remuneration:  
{total  additional remuneration = difference between the two reference rates * number of 
hours worked on the action } 
{total basic remuneration = national project reference rate * number of hours worked on the 
action } 
If the action reference is equal or lower  than the national project reference, there is no 
additional remuneration; the remuneration paid to the employee is all basic 
remuneration.  
Example personnel costs with a dditional remuneration (Part 1 of 3):   
1. Ms R is employed full -time as professor at University X. She has a basic annual gross salary of 
EUR 24 000. The internal rules of the university provide that professors involved in research 
projects financed by ext ernal funders can get up to EUR 6 000 per month of full dedication to the 
project. However, due to budgetary restrictions the maximum that has been paid to any professor 
in a national project was EUR 4 800. Ms R worked in 2017 for the H2020 action 200 hour s. For 
those hours she received an extra salary of EUR 6 500. She also participated in other projects 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  60 generating other extras for her. So, her total gross annual salary was EUR 36 000. The hourly rate 
for the H2020 action is as follows:  
The salary of Ms R varies depending on her participation in certain projects. Therefore, the 
beneficiary must assess if any part of that salary qualifies as additional remuneration. For that, it 
must compare the action reference with the national project reference:  
Action re ference rate = basic salary corresponding to the 200 hours worked for the action ((24 000 
/ 1720) x 200 = 2 790,70 €) + bonus paid for the action (6 500 €)  = 9 290,70 € / 200 (hours 
worked in the action) = 46,45 €/hour (hourly rate)  
National project refer ence rate (in this example based on the internal rules of the university 
applicable to national projects) = maximum salary paid for any professor working in a national 
project in accordance with the internal rules = 4 800 € / (1720 annual productive hour s / 12 
months) = 4 800 € / 143,33 hours = 33,49 €/hour  
The Action reference (i.e. 46,45) is higher than the national project reference (i.e. 33,49). The 
excess (46,45 – 33,49 = 12,96 €/hour) qualifies as additional remuneration. Therefore:  
The total basic r emuneration  = 33,49 €/hour x 200 (hours worked in the action) = 6 698 €  
The total additional remuneration  = 12,96 €/hour x 200 (hours worked in the action) = 2 592 €  
(This example continues here for the calculation of the hourly rate)  
2. Same situation as above, but in this case the work in the action has been done under a 
supplementary employment contract covering additional working hours (on top of the full -time 
contract of the professor).  
Action reference rate = 6 500 € (remuneration of the supplementary employment contract) / 200 
hours (covered by that supplementary contract) = 32,50 €/hour  
National project reference rate = 4 800 € / (1720 annual productive hour s / 12 months) = 4 800 € 
/ 143,3 3 hours = 33,49 €/hour  
In this case, the action  reference (i.e. 32,50) is lower than the national project reference (i.e. 
33,49). Therefore, the beneficiary is NOT paying additional remuneration.  
The total basic remuneration = 32,50 €/hour x 200 (hours w orked in the action) = 6 500 €.  
Step 2 —  Calculation of the hourly rate (for each  employee; on the basis of basic 
remuneration)  
The beneficiary must then calculate the hourly rate to be charged to the action for the 
employee:  
 If there is  additional remuneration , the beneficiary must calculate the hourly 
rate using only  the basic remuneration. In practice, this will be the action 
reference, capped at the national project reference (i.e. the hourly rate will 
normally be equal to the nationa l project reference rate).  
Example personnel costs with additional remuneration (Part 2 of 3):  
1. Ms R worked 200 hours over the financial year in the action. For that time she received 
a remuneration of 9 290,70 €. In the calculations made in part 1 of the example we 
identified that 2 592 € qualify as additional remuneration.  
The hourly rate applicable to the action will be, therefore:  
(Actual annual personnel costs for the action - additional remuneration) / hours worked in 
the action over the year = (9  290,70 € - 2 592 €) / 200 = 33,49 €/hour.  
Personnel costs resulting from the hourly rate = 33,49 €/hour x 200 = 6 698 €.  
(This example continues here for the eligibility of additional remuneration)   
 If there is NO additional remuneration  (i.e. all is basic remuneration), the 
beneficiary can simply use the action reference as hourly rate to charge to the 
H2020 action.  
Example personnel costs without additional remuneration (Part 2 of 3):  
Ms R worked 200 hours over the financia l year in the action. For that time she received a 
remuneration of EUR 6 500 through an additional contract.  
Action reference rate = 6 500 € (remuneration of the supplementary employment 
contract) / 200 hours (covered by that supplementary contract) = 32, 50 €/hour  
National project reference rate = 4 800 € / (1720 annual productive hour s / 12 months) = 
4 800 € / 143,33 hours = 33,49 €/hour  
In this case, the action reference (i.e. 32,50) is lower than the national project reference 
(i.e. 33,49). Therefore, the beneficiary must use the action reference as hourly rate to 
charge to the H2020 action:  
Total personnel costs to be declared = 32,50 €/hour x 200 (hours worked in the action) = 
6 500 €.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  61 Step 3 —  Multiplying the hourly rate by the hours worked on the action  
After that, the hourly rate for the employee must be multiplied by the number of hours 
s/he actually worked on the action  and thi s gives the amount of basic remuneration that 
can be charged to the action (see examples in Step 2 above) . 
Step 4 —  For non -profit legal entities: addition of the additional remuneration  (if any )  
If the beneficiary is a non -profit entity and the payments  that are additional 
remuneration are eligible , it may also declare them to the action.  
If the resulting amount  (for the year)  is above the 8000 EUR  ceiling , it must be 
capped:  
 
Occupation  Contract  
hired full time during the 
entire year  NOT hired full time during the 
entire year  
working 
exclusively for 
the EU action  
during the full 
financial year  EUR 8 000  pro-rata amount of  EUR 8  000 
NOT working 
exclusively for the 
EU action  during 
the full financial 
year  {8 000 / annual productive hours FTE} * hours worked for the 
action over the 
year  
 
The ceiling is fixed at EUR 8 000 per year for each full  time equivalent (FTE), i.e. EUR 
8 000 for a full-time employee working exclusively for the action during the 
entire year .  
This ceiling  covers not only the additional payment (bonus) but also the additional 
taxes, costs and social security contributions triggered by the additional payment .  
For an employee working exclusively for the action  but not hired full time 
during the entire year , the ceiling is reduced pro -rata.  
Example s: 
1. A researcher employed part time by the beneficiary to work four days a week during the 
entire  year would correspond to 0.8 FTE  the ceiling would be fixed at EUR 8 000* 0 ,8 = 
EUR 6 400 per year.   
2. A researcher employed full time to work for the action from January to March (i.e. for 
three months) would correspond to 0.25 FTE (3 out of 12 months)  the ceiling would be 
fixed at EUR 8 000 * 0 ,25 = EUR 2 000.  
If the researcher was employed part time ( e.g. 80  %)  the ceiling would be adjusted as 
follows: 8 000 * 0 ,25 * 0 ,80 = EUR 1 600.  
For an employee not working exclusively for the action , the ceiling is calculated 
pro-rata, based on the hours worked for the action. Therefore, additional remuneration  
is eligible up to a maximum of:  
EUR 8 000  X hours worked by the employee for the 
action over the year  annual productive hours of an FTE

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Articl e 6.2.A.1  62 Example personnel costs with additional remuneration (Part 3 of 3):  
1. Ms R worked 200 hours over the financial year. For that work she received 6 698 € of 
basic remuneration and 2 592 € of additional remuneration.  
If the beneficiary is a for -profit legal entity, the 2 592 € of additional remuneration would be 
automatically ineli gible. The personnel costs which the beneficiary can charge to the action 
would be therefore 6 698 €.  
If the beneficiary is a non -profit legal entity, additional remuneration may be eligible up to 
the ceiling. To calculate the eligibly part, you need to de termine the pro -rata of the cap which 
corresponds to the 200 hours worked for the action:  
(8 000 / 1 720) x 200 = 930,23 €  
Although the beneficiary paid 2 592 € of additional remuneration, only 930,23 € are eligible. 
The difference (2 592 – 930, 23 = 1 661,77 €) is ineligible, since it  exceeds the ceiling.  
Therefore, the personnel costs which the beneficiary could charge to the action would be: 6 
698 € of basic remuneration + 930,23 € of additional remuneration = 7 628,23 €.  
 
For case 2 beneficiaries (u nit costs in accordance with the usual cost accounting 
practices): 2 step s 
Step 1 —  Calculation of the hourly rate (for each  employee)  
The beneficiary can use the hourly rate(s) that it uses normally (usual cost accounting 
practices) as average personnel costs, provided that:  
 the cost accounting practices are applied in a consistent  manner, based on 
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding  
 the hourly rate is calculated using the actual personnel  costs recorded  in the 
beneficiary’s accounts , excluding any ineligible cost or costs already included in 
other budget categories and  
 the hourly rate is calculated using one of the three options  provided in the 
MGA for the number of annual productive hours  (e.g. option 3 ‘standard 
annual productive hou rs’). 
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices, based on 
objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is an audit. It must do this no matter 
who is funding the action.  
This does not mean that cost accounting practices must be the same for all types of 
employees, departments or cost centres of the beneficiary. If, for instance, the 
beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices include different calculation methods 
for per manent personnel and temporary personnel, this is acceptable. However, the 
beneficiary cannot use different methods for specific research actions or projects on 
an ad -hoc basis.  
Example (acceptable usual cost accounting practices):  Individual (actual) pers onnel 
costs are used for researchers, average personnel costs (unit costs calculated in accordance 
with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) are used for technical support staff.  
Example (unacceptable usual cost accounting practices):  Average  personnel costs are 
used to calculate costs in externally -funded projects only.  
If necessary, the hourly rate must be adjusted to remove:  
 cost elements that are ineligible under the GA (even if they are part of the 
beneficiary’s usual methodology for dete rmining the hourly rate).  
Example:  A beneficiary calculates the hourly rate in accordance with its usual cost 
accounting practices and includes taxes not included in remuneration. These are ineligible 
and must therefore be removed from the hourly rate dec lared for personnel working on 
the action.  
 costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of the 
same costs;  
Example:  Beneficiaries whose cost accounting practices include for the calculation of the 
hourly rate indirect costs u nder Article 6.2. These indirect costs must be removed from 
the pool of costs used to calculate the hourly rate charged to H2020 actions. In H2020 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  63 actions, indirect costs must be declared using a flat rate of 25  %, so personnel costs 
cannot include any ind irect costs.  
Budgeted or estimated elements used to calculate the hourly rate can only be accepted 
if they:  
 are relevant, i.e. clearly related to personnel costs  
 are used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not play a major role in calculating the 
hourly rate)  
 correspond to objective and verifiable information (i.e. their basis is clearly 
defined and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated)  
Example:  Calculating average 2014 hourly rates by using 2013 payroll data and 
increasing them by adding the CPI (consumer price index) on which the basic salaries are 
indexed.  
Beneficiaries may request the approval of the methodology  used by them, by 
submitting (v ia the following address: EC-H2020 -UNIT-COST -METHODOLOGY -
CERTIFICATION@ec.europa.eu ) an audit certificate on their usual cost accounting 
practices (see Article 18.1.2(b)  and Annex 6) . Costs declared in line with an approved 
methodology will not be challenged subsequently (unless the beneficiaries concealed 
information for the purpose of the approval).  
Step 2 —  Multiplying the h ourly rate by the hours worked on the action  
After that, t he hourly rate for the employee must be multiplied by the number of hours 
s/he actually worked on the action  and this gives the amount that can be charged to the 
action . 
 
Specific cases  (direct personnel costs  for employees (or equivalent)  (A.1) ):  
Persons working exclusively on the action — There is NO different calculation method for staff 
working 100 % on the action. (The percentage of time dedicated to the action does NOT make a 
difference for the way how personnel costs must be calculated; it matters only for the types of records 
that mu st be kept (see Article 18.1.2 )). Therefore, the calculation method for personnel costs of 
Article  6.2.A  (as chosen by the beneficiary) applies.  
Since  there is no obligation to keep time -sheets for periods covered by a declaration on exclusive work , 
beneficiaries should report:  
 
 for annual hourly rates: a pro -rata of the annual productive hours corresponding to the period 
covered by the declaration (at the annual hourly rate)  
 
 for monthly hourly rates: 1/12 of the annual productive hours for each month actually worked 
for the action in the period covered by the declaration (at the monthly hourly rate).  
 
Example:  
1a Researcher Y worked exclusively in the action during the reporting period running f rom 1.10.2014 to 
31.03.2016. Its actual annual personnel costs were EUR 32 000 for 2014 and EUR 34 400 for 2015. The 
beneficiary applies 1720 as annual productive hours  and calculates annual hourly rates.  
The personnel cost to be reported would be calculat ed as follows:  
 Hourly rate  Hours worked for the project  
2014  (32 000 / 1720)   x [(1720 / 12 months) x 3 (Oct, Nov, Dec)]  
 18,60   x 430 = 8 000  
2015  (34 400 / 1720)   x 1720 
 20  x 1720 = 34 400  
2016   The financial year is not completed so we use the 2015 hourly rate  
 20 x [(1720 / 12 months) x 3 (Jan, Feb, Mar)]  = 8 600  
 TOTAL  = 51 000  
1b Researcher Y worked exclusively in the action during the reporting period running from 1.10.2014 to 
31.03.2016. Its monthly personnel cost were 2 666,66 EUR in 2014, 2 860 EUR from January 2015 until October 
2015 and 2 900 EUR from then on. The beneficiar y applies 1720 as annual productive hours  and calculates 
monthly hourly rates.

If the declaration covers months in which the person was absent  for more than half of the working 
days those months can NOT be taken into account to calculate the hours worked in the action  (— unless 
the absence is linked to annual leave AND the duration does not exceed the pro -rata of annual leave 
entitlements corresponding to  the period covered by the declaration).  
Example:  
1. Researcher Y worked exclusively in the action from1 July 2014 t o 31 October 2014. In August it took 
three weeks of holidays and in September it was 10 days on sick leave. The beneficiary applies 1720 as 
annual productive hours  
Number of hours that can be charged to the action based on the declaration = 3 months (July,  September 
and October) x (1720 / 12) = 3 x 143,33 = 430 hours  
August is not taken into account because the person was absent more than half of the working days, since 
s/he took three weeks of holidays.  
2. The person has the right to two working days of annual leave per month worked. The period covered by 
the declaration is from January to September (i.e. 9 months). Therefore, the leave entitlement of the 
person for that period is 9 x 2 = 18 working days. Th e person takes 3 weeks of annual leave in August. 
August could also be counted because the leave taken (i.e. 15 working days) is less that the leave 
entitlement for that period (i.e. 18 working days).  
Employees  hired during on -going financial year  (at the  end of the reporting period) — Since these 
employees did not work for the beneficiary during the last financial year, the annual hourly rate can 
only be calculated on the basis of the personnel costs incurred during the ongoing financial year .  
Example:  The reporting period runs from 1.10.2014 to 31.03.2016. The beneficiary hires a new employee 
on 1.2.2016  the hourly rate would be calculated taking into account his/her personnel costs for February 
and March 2016.   
In order to avoid calculation errors, it is particular ly important to determine the pro -rata of the 
annual productive hours correctly  (e.g. if  option 1   - 1 720 fixed hours are used, the productive 
hours for the period February -March would be 1 720 /12 * 2 = 286,66;  if option 2 -individual 
annual productive hours - is used, the productive hours for the period February -March would be the 
actual productive hours for the period February -March; if option 3 – standard annual productive 
hours - is used, the productive hours for the period February -March would be the standard annual 
productive hours/12*2) .  
End-of-contract indemnities  — Since the entitlement to end -of-contract indemnities is most often 
generated over a period of time longer than a financial year, the beneficiary may charge the indemnity  
in the reporting period in which the employee’s contract ends  — but outside the hourly rate (i.e. 
separately and on top of the personnel costs declared on the basis of the hourly rate)  AND only for  the 
part that corresponds to the time worked by the person on the action (i.e. pro -rata of the total time 
during which the entitlement was generated).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  65 Moreover , the indemnity can be accepted ONLY  if it: 
 arises from the applicable national labour law  and 
 is recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary and  
 is incurred during the action duration (although the actual payment may take place latter).  
Employment contract remunerated per hour — For employment contracts that do not establish a 
fixed salary and a number of hours to be worked but only an amount to be paid for each hour worked 
by the employee , individual annual productive hours (i.e. option 2) can only be applied if all of the 
following conditions are fulfilled:  
 the employment contract explicitly fix es the hourly rate to be paid  
 the employment contract established that the salary is the result of multiplying the hourly rate 
by the number of hours worked  
 the total salary paid under the employment contract is identifiable and supported by auditable 
documents (e.g. payslips and declarations to the tax authorities)  
 the employment contract is the only contract between the person and the entity (i.e. there is no 
other parallel contract).  
If those  conditions are fulfilled, the individual annual productive hou rs can be calculated as follows:  
{total salary paid to the employee in the financial year  
divided by  
hourly rate fixed in the employment contract} .

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  66 This summary table explains the three different options  for annual productive hours (for case 1A  and case 2  beneficiaries) : 
Options  What does it mean?  When can it be used? How should it be used?  What happens if you make a mistake?  
Option 1 
1 720 
fixed 
hours  The number of hours is fixed for 
full-time employees (and it is 
pro-rata for employees working 
part -time or working only part 
of the year for the beneficiary).  Can be used in all cases ; any beneficiary can use this option.  
A pro -rata of 1720 hours can be used if:  
 the employee has not worked the full year for the 
beneficiary or  
 the employee’s contract explicitly states (or allows to 
determine) a pr ecise percentage of a full  time 
equivalent  (FTE)  covered by such contract.  
Examples (pro -rata calculations):  
1. Researcher X worked for Beneficiary Z from 1 October to 31 
December; i.e. 3 full months. The pro -rata of the annual 
productive hors would be calculated as follows:  
1720 / 12 (months) * 3 (October, November, December) = 
430 produ ctive hours  
2. The contract of Researcher Y with Beneficiary Z establishes 
that it must work 20 hours per week, while a full -time employee 
at Beneficiary Z works 40 hours per week. Working days and 
leave entitlements are the same. The annual productive hou rs 
would be calculated as follows:  
1720 * [20 hours (Researcher Y) / 40 hours (full -time 
employee)] = 1720 * 50 % (part -time percentage) = 860 
productive hours    
Option 2  
Individual 
annual 
productive 
hours  
 
 The number of hours is 
calculated on the basis of the 
‘annual workable hours’ of the 
employee (i.e. the total number 
of hours for which a employee is 
working for the beneficiary, 
including the overtime worked 
and absences (such as sick leave 
or other types  of special leave) . This option can be used, if:  
 the number of ‘individual annual productive hours’ is 
calculated according to the formula specified in the GA  
{annual workable hours of the person (according to the 
employment contract, applicable labour agreement or 
national law)  
plus  
overtime worked  If our the auditors find that a beneficiary made 
a mistake, the Commission/Agency will 
recalculate the eligible costs as follows:  
 if the calculation method was not 
consistently applied (e.g. the beneficiary 
used option 2 for one employee and option 
3 for another employee employed under 
similar conditions) : the auditors will adjust  
the number of annual productive hours by 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Art icle 6.2.A.1  67  
 minus  
absences (such as sick leave and special leave)}  
 the ‘annual workable hours’ are established according to 
one of the following:  
 employment contract of the person concerned  
 applicable collective labou r agreement  
 national law on working time.  
Example:  contract stipulating 35 hours of work per week  
 this calculation method is consistently applied (per group 
of personnel under similar conditions).  
Example for calculation of individual annual workable hours:  
X is a full -time researcher (working eight hours per day, from 
Monday to Friday) at Research Centre Z. X’s contract includes 22 
working days of annual leave, plus 8 days of public holidays. In the 
financial year covered by the reporting period in qu estion, X 
worked 29 hours of overtime and was on sick leave for 5 days.  
The individual annual workable hours would therefore be:  
365 days — 104 days (Saturdays and Sundays) — 22 days 
(annual leave) — 8 days (public holidays) = 231 days x 8 hours 
per day = 1 848 hours  
Individual annual productive hours for Researcher X:  
Annual workable hours = 1 848  
+ overtime (hours)  = 29  
- annual sick leave (5 days x 8 hours) = 40  
 individual annual productive hours for Researcher X = 1  837 
Research Centre Z may use 1 837 as individual annual productive 
hours for this researcher.  
 
 
 applying opt ion 2 to all persons concerned, 
where possible.  
 if the employment contract, applicable 
collective labour agreement or national 
working time legislation does not allow to 
determine the number of individual annual 
workable hours: the auditors will apply 
option 1.  
 if not all annual workable hours were 
included, the auditors will recalculate the 
productive hours to include all workable 
hours.   
  This option can NOT be used  if the employment contract, 
collective labour agreement or national law does not allow to 
determine  the number of individual annual workable hours.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  68 Option 3  
Standard 
annual 
productive 
hours  The number of hours is 
calculated on the basis of the 
‘standard annual productive 
hours’ generally applied by the 
beneficiary for its personnel, in 
accordance with its usual cost 
accounting practices.  
The standard annual productive 
hours may be calculated  for the 
entity as a whole, per category 
of personnel, per cost centre, 
etc.  
The beneficiary may include or 
exclude certain activities (e.g. 
general training, general 
meetings etc.)  when calculating 
the standard annual productive 
hours, if this is in line  with its 
usual cost accounting practices.  
 This option can be used if:  
 the number of standard annual productive hours is 
calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual 
cost accounting practices  
 this calculation method is consistently applied (per 
group of personnel under similar conditions)  
 the number of standard annual productive hours is at 
least 90  % of ‘standard annual workable hours’  
The standard annual workable hours is the standard 
number of hours that a full time employee of the group 
havin g the same standard productive hours (‘reference 
group’,  e.g. a category of employees, employees of a 
cost centre, etc. ) must be present at work under normal 
circumstances, as defined in:  
 the employment contracts of the reference 
group  
 an applicable colle ctive labour agreement or  
 the national law on working time.  
If its number of standard annual productive hours is 
higher  than 90  %, the beneficiary must use the number 
of standard annual productive hours.  
If its number of standard annual productive hours is  
lower  than 90  %, the beneficiary must use the 90  % or 
choose one of the other options.  
Example for calculation of standard annual workable hours:  
Full-time researchers hired by Research Centre Z have an 
employment contract that states that they must work eight hours 
per day, from Monday to Friday. National legislation provides for 
22 working days of annual leave, plus eight days of public 
holidays. The applicable collective labour agreement adds three 
extra days of annual leave.  
The standard annual workabl e hours for Research Centre Z would If our the auditors find that a beneficiary made 
a mistake, the Commission/Agency will 
recalculate the eligible costs as follows:  
 if the standard annual productive hours 
were calculated not in accordance with 
the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices, the auditors will adjust the 
number of annual productive hours by 
applying option 2, if possible;  
 if the calculation method was not 
applied consistently, the auditor will 
adjust the number of annual productive  
hours by applying option 2, if possible;  
 if there is no applicable reference for 
the standard annual workable hours, 
the auditors will apply option 1;  
 if the number of standard annual 
productive hours used by the 
beneficiary was lower than 90  % of 
standar d annual workable hours, the 
auditor will use either the 90  % of 
workable hours or option 1, whichever 
is more favourable for the beneficiary.  
 if the two first indents in the middle 
column (number calculated in 
accordance with usual accounting 
practices AN D calculation method 
consistently applied) are fulfilled but 
the beneficiary uses 90  % of standard 
annual workable hours instead of the 
number of annual productive hours 
arrived at by using its usual accounting 
practices (higher than 90  %), the auditor 
will adjust the number of productive  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.1  69 therefore be:  
365 days — 104 days (Saturdays and Sundays) — 22 days (annual 
leave) — 8 days (public holidays) — 3 days (collective agreement) 
= 228 days * 8 hours per day = 1 824 hours  
Standard annual productive hours for Research Centre Z:  
Research Centre Z would like to use its usual cost accounting 
practices to calculate the hourly rates for EU actions. It calculates 
the number of standard annual productive hours as follows:  
Annual working days = 228  
- average annual  sick leave (days) = 3  
- days of general training = 4  
- other unproductive activities (days) = 9  
 productive days = 212  
Multiplied by 8 working hours per day  
 standard annual productive hours = 1 696  
This number of standard annual productive hours must then be 
compared with 90  % of standard annual workable hours (in this 
example 1 824).  
90 % of 1824 = 1 642  
1 696 hours (usual cost accounting practice) > 1 642 hours (90  % 
annual workable hours)  
Research Centre Z may apply its number of standard annual 
productive hours (i.e. 1 696) to EU actions since the number is 
higher than 90  % of annual workable hours.  
If its number of standard annual hours is lower than 1 642 (e.g. 20 
days of other unproductive tasks instead of 9  1 608 annual 
productive hours), Rese arch Centre Z must apply 1 642 hours 
(90  % of the annual workable hours).  
If its number of standard annual productive hours is higher than 
90 % (in our example it is 93  %: 1 696/1 824), Research Centre Z 
must use this number (and not 90  % of annual workable hours).  
 
 
 hours to the higher number.  
 If the standard annual productive hours 
is 90 % of the standard annual 
workable hours the auditor will not 
challenge that amount if the amount is 
in accordance with the usual cost 
accounting practices of the beneficiary 
and the calculation method is 
consistently applied.

 This option can NOT be used i f the employment contract, 
collective labour agreement or national law does not allow to 
determine the number of annual workable hours for the 
group of personnel.  
Example (no applicable reference for standard annual workable 
hours):  
A researcher carries out research for the beneficiary for a fixed 
salary per month. However, the employment contract does not 
allow to determine the number of hours to be worked. There is no 
applicable collect ive agreement and national legislation does not 
regulate the number of workable hours per year for this type of 
labour agreement.  
In this case, there is no applicable reference for standard annual 
workable hours. Therefore, the beneficiary must use option 1 (1 
720 fixed hours).

1.2 Direct personnel costs: Natural persons  with direct contract  (A.2)  
1.2.1  What?  This budget category covers typically the costs of in-house consultants  and 
similar persons (i.e. self-employed natural persons ) that worked on the action  for the 
beneficiary under conditions similar to those of an employee, but under a contract which is NOT 
legally the same a s for employees . It regards, in particular, contracts qualified as quasi -
subordinate work contracts under national law when the conditions under which the work is 
carried out are similar to those of an employee.  
What not?  Staff provided by another entity a gainst a price, including staff provided by a 
temporary work agency  (because in this case  there is no direct contract between the person and 
the beneficiary; the contract is not with the beneficiary but with the entity hiring the person ). 
Staff provided by  a temporary work agency — A contract with a temporary work agency 
qualifies typically as purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out 
directly some task of the action — in which case it would be considered as subcontracting).  
Thus, although NOT eligible as personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget 
categories (i.e. D.3 other goods and services or B. subcontracting), if they comply with the 
eligibility conditions  (especially  best value for money and no conflict of in terest; see Articles 10  
and 13). 
1.2.2 Costs for natural persons working under a direct contract may be declared as :  
 actual costs  (most common case)  
OR  
 unit costs  in accordance with the usual cost  accounting practices  (average personnel 
costs; see Article 5.2(a) ). 
1.2.3  The c osts must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/used during the  action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc. ; see Article 6.1(a)  and (b) ) 
 there must be a direct contract  between the natural person (i ndividual) and the 
beneficiary  
The contract cannot be with a third party legal entity (e.g. a temporary work agency) , 
even if that third party is a one -person company.  
 the person must work  under  conditions similar to those of an employee, in particular:  
 
  
 
 the beneficiary must organise and supervise the work of the person in a way similar 
to that of its employee s 
Example ( acceptable ): 
The beneficiary's project leader and the person discuss  regularly the work to be carried  out for 
the action. The project leader decides the tasks and timing of the work and instructs the 
person accordingly.  
Example ( not acceptable ): 
The beneficiary's project leader and the person meet only once a month or irregularly , for 
updates  on the state of play of the entrusted work. If changes are needed, th ey have to be 
agreed by the person and may lead to a change of the amount c harged to the beneficiary.  
 the beneficiary must be able to ensure reliable time recording (for the hours  that 
the person work s for the action ) 
 Similar does not mean equal — The working conditions of the person do NOT have  to be exactly 
the same that those of an employee, but overall similar.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.2  72  
 
 
 the person is subject to similar presence requirements as the  employees.  
Examples ( acceptable ): 
The person works physically at the beneficiary's premises , following a time schedule similar to 
that of the employees  (e.g. the beneficiary authorises up to two days of teleworking per week  
to its personnel and the person has chosen to benefit from this regime, i.e. works 2 days in 
teleworking and 3 days physically at the beneficiary's premises ). 
Example ( not acceptable ): 
The entity authorises up to two days of teleworking per week. However,  the person works four 
days in teleworking and only one day at the beneficiary's premises.  
 the result  of the work carried out ( including patents or copyright)  must in principle 
belong to  the beneficiary   
If (exceptionally) they belong to the person , the be neficiary must  (just like for employees)  
obtain the necessary rights  from the person  (transfer, licences or other), in order to be 
able to respect its obligations under the GA  (see Article 26.3 ). 
 not be significantly different  from costs for employees performing similar tasks  
The remuneration must  be based on working time, rather than on delivering specific 
outputs/products.   
1.2.4  Costs of natural persons working under a direct contract for a beneficiary must be 
calculated  according to the  same rules  as explained in point 1.1.4 (i.e. hourly rate multiplied by 
the number of actual hours worked on the action).  
However, for  the actual costs hourly rate , the beneficiaries must use one of  the following 
options:  
 if the contract specifies an hourly rate: this hourly rate must be used  
 if the contract states a fixed amount for the work and the number of hours to be worked : 
the global amount for the work must be divided by the number of hours to be worked  
 if the contract states a fixed amount for the work but does not specify the number of hours  
to be worked: th e global amount for the work must be divided by the pro -rata of 1 720 
annual productive hours which correspond s to the duration of the contract over the 
financial year.  
Example: The contract provides that the person will work at the beneficiary's premises for assisting in 
research tasks. The contract is for 6 months starting on 1 January 2017 and ending on 30 June 2017. 
According to its time records, the person worked 500 hours in the H2020 action over that period. The 
contract sets a monthly payment of EUR 3 000 but does not explicitly establish the number of  hours to 
be worked.  
Personnel  costs for the action = hourly rate x 500 (hours worked in the action)  
Hourly rate = annual  personnel costs  / annual productive hours = (3 000 € x 6 months) / (1 720 hours 
x (6 months/12 months)) = 18 000 € / (1 720 x 0,5) = 1 8 000 € / 860 hours = 20,93 €/hour  
Personnel costs for the action = 20,93 x 500 = 10 465 €.  
Social security contributions which are mandatory under national law may be  include d in the 
calculation of the hourly rate.  
For the unit costs  hourly rate ( average personnel costs) , the rules in point 1.1.4 apply without 
any changes.  
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep records of the hours which the person 
worked for the action (e.g. time -sheets etc.; see Article 18.1.2 ).

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A.2  73 This summary table explains how to treat different types of work contracts  for declaring costs 
under H202017:  
Characteristics of 
the contract  Contract remunerating time  
(e.g. the contract establishes that the person must 
work for the beneficiary  40 hours per week ) Contract not specifying the working time 
conditions  
(e.g. the contract establishes the tasks , but the time to be 
worked (hours) is not defined  in the contract, collective 
labour agreement or national law)  
The contract is an 
employment 
contract , i.e.: 
 recognized as 
such by the 
national labour 
law 
AND  
 the hiring 
entity pays 
social security 
contributions 
for the hired 
person  CASE A  
This is the standard situation . 
The costs may be declared in category A.1 
‘employees (or equivalent)’  (Article 
6.2.A.1 ). 
They must be calculated as described in 
Article 6.2.A. Calculation (point 1.1.4 ):  
 The beneficiary may choose among the 
three options for annual productive 
hours to calculate the hourly rate.  
 CASE B  
The costs may be declared in category A.1 
‘employees (or equivalent)’ ( Article 6.2.A.1 ). 
They must be calculated as described in 
Article 6.2.A. Calculation (point 1.1.4 ); 
however : 
 Only option 1 (i.e. 1720 fixed annual 
productive hours) can be used to 
calculate the hourly rate.  
 If the employment contract does not 
cover the full financial year, the annual 
productive hours must be calculated as 
a pro -rata of 1720.  
Example:  Contract from 01 .01.2015 to 
31.03.2015. Annual productive hours = 
(1720/12) x 3 (Jan, Feb, Mar) = 430  
 
Other contract  
(i.e. not an 
employment 
contract)  CASE C1:  the costs fulfil the conditions of  
Article 6.2.A.2 . 
The costs may be declared in category A.2 
‘natural persons with direct contract’ 
(Article 6.2.A.2).  
The costs must be calculated as described 
in point 1.2.4.  
CASE C2:  the costs do NOT fulfil the 
conditions of  Article 6. 2.A.2 . 
The costs can NOT be declared in category 
A. ‘personnel costs’. They must be treated 
like CASE D 1. 
 CASE D 1: the costs do NOT fulfil the 
conditions of Article 6.2.A.2 . 
The costs can NOT be declared in category A 
‘personnel costs’.  
However, they may be eligible under another 
budget category:  
 if the contract covers tasks described 
in Annex 1: in category B 
‘subcontracting’ ( Articles 6.2.B  and

17  These explanations do NOT apply to SME owners or beneficiaries that are natural persons  not receiving a 
salary (see Article 6.2.A.4 and 6.2.A.5 ). 
 The beneficiary must award 
the contracts ensuring best value 
for money and avoiding any

1.3 Direct personnel costs: Seconded  personnel ( against payment ) (A.3)  
1.3.1  What?  This budget category covers  the costs of person s that worked on the action and 
that were seconded by a third party  as an in -kind contribution  against payment  (see Article 
11). 
What not?  Persons provided by a temporary work agency, s econdment of staff between 
beneficiaries (or linked third parties) in the same grant or secondment by a third party free of 
charge.  
Staff  provided by a t emporary work agency — A contract with a temporary work agency 
qualifies typically as a purchase of services (unless the temporary work agency carries out 
directly some task of the action — in which case it can be considered as subcontracting). Thus, 
although NOT eligible as personnel costs, the costs can be charged under other budget 
categories (i.e. D.3 other goods and services or B. subcontracting), if they comply with the 
eligibility conditions  (especially  best value for money and no conflict of interes t; see Articles 10  
and 13). 
Secondment of staff between beneficiaries (or linked third parties)  — Is allowed, but it 
is the beneficiary /third party  who employs the person who has to declare its costs (NOT the 
beneficiary /third party  to whom the person has been seconded). The costs declared must be 
supported by reliable time records of the number of hours the person worked for the action. 
Those time r ecords must be produced under the responsibility of the beneficiary /third party  to 
whom the person is seconded  
Persons seconded free of charge  — Costs for persons seconded free of charge (i.e. the third 
party’s costs) can be declared as personnel costs by the beneficiary, if they fulfil the conditions 
of Articles 6.4  and 12. 
 
 
 
1.3.2  Costs for person s seconded by a third party may be declared ONLY as actual costs . 
1.3.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked  to the action, etc. ; see Article 6.1(a) and (b) ) 
 the person must be  seconded  
‘Second ed’ means  the temporary transfer of personnel from a third party to the 
beneficiary. The seconded person is still paid and employed by the third party, but works 
for the beneficiary. S/he is at the disposal of the beneficiary.  
Example:  A researcher in a public res earch centre is seconded to work in a university that is a 
beneficiary in a GA.  
Best practice:  Secondment s should be formalized via a secondment agreement. The 
secondment agreement has to detail the conditions of secondment (tasks, payment  (or not) 
from one entity to the other , duration of the secondment, location, etc.) .  
A secondment normally require s the seconded person to work at the beneficiary’s 
premises, although in specific cases it may be agreed otherwise  in the secondment 
agreemen t.  
 the beneficiary  must reimburse the costs  to the third party ( i.e. not for free)   
 fulfil the additional  cost eligibility conditions  set out in Article 11 .1. 
 For information on in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge , see Articles 6.4  
and 12.

beneficiary  — up to  the costs actually incurred by the third party  (see Article 11.1 ). 
For the calculation of  the upper limit  (i.e. the third party’s actual costs ), the same calculation rules

1.4 Direct personnel costs: SMEs owners & n atural persons not receiving a salary  (A.4 & 
A.5) 
1.4.1 What?  These budget categories cover the costs of SME owners  (direct owners or co -
owners of the SME which is a beneficiary of the grant)  and beneficiaries that are natural persons 
which work on the action, but don’t  receiv e a salary .  
This include s SME owners who are remunerated/compensated for their work for the SME by  any 
other means than a salary (for example, dividends, service contracts /other non -employment 
contracts  between the company and the owner, etc. ). 
What not?  SME owners who receive a s alary (registered as such in the accounts of the SME) 
cannot declare personnel costs under this budget category, unless s/he can show that this salary 
corresponds exclusively to the management of the SME (and is therefore not linked to the action). 
(In thi s case, the salary for the management of the SME cannot be declared.)   
1.4.2  These costs must be declared as the unit cost (hourly rate) fixed by Commission  Decision 
C(2013) 819718 and set out  in Annex 2  and 2a of the GA . 
The precise unit cost is not pre -fixed by the Decision; the ‘amount per unit’ (hourly rate) must be 
calculated for each individual — before signature of the GA  — according to the following formula : 
Amount per unit = {{EUR 4  650 or 4 880* /143 hours}  
multiplied by  
{country -specific correction coefficient  of the country where the beneficiary is established }} 
The country -specific correction coefficient is the one set out in the H2020 Work Programme  (section 3 
MSCA)19 in force at the time of the call .  
*EUR 4  650 for calls under Work Programmes 2014 -2015 and 2016 -2017 and  EUR 4 880 for calls 
under Work Programme 2018 -2020. 
Example:  A German SME owner not receiving a salary will calculate the hourly rate as follows:  
EUR 4 650/143  * 98.8%  = EUR 32,13/hour  
In practice, the declaration of costs for SME owners and beneficiaries tha t are natural persons is 
very simple and almost completely automatized : The beneficiaries must only indicate the number 
of hours worked on the action and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT system . 
1.4.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation etc.; see Article 6.1(b) ) 
 be declared for an  SME owner /beneficiary that is natural person , who works on the 
action but does not receive a salary.  
The owner may be compensated by means such as dividends, service contracts between 
the company and the owner, etc.

the action (e.g. time -sheets etc.; see Article 18.1.2 ).

1. Travel costs and related subsistence allowances  (D.1) : Types of costs — Form 
— Eligibility c onditions — Calculation  
This budget category applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants  under the General MGA . 
The additional option for access to trans-national research infrastructure (together with the 
corresponding Article 16  and other provisions) will be inserted into the GA if the action also 
involves access to research infrastructure.  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the travel costs and related subsistence allowances 
(including  all related duties, taxes and charges that the beneficiary has paid , if including them is 
part of the usual practices for travel , e.g. non -deductible VAT; see Article 6.5 ) spent for the 
action . 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries may contact the Commission/Agency to ask whether a particularly 
expensive travel plan would be accepted or not.  
Travel and subsistence costs relate to the personnel of the beneficiaries . They may also relate to 
experts that participate in the action on an ad hoc basis (e.g. attending specific meetings),  if: 
 the experts’ participation is foreseen in Annex 1  or 
 their participation is  specifically justified in the periodic technical report  and the 
Commission/Agen cy approve d it without formally amending the GA (simplified approval 
procedure).  
The beneficiary may reimburse the experts or handle the travel arrangements itself (and be 
invoiced directly).  There is no distinction between travelling in - or outside Europe .  
1.2 Travel and subsistence costs must be declared  as actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ).  
1.3 The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) ) 
The travel for which costs are claimed must be necessary for the action (e.g. to present a  
paper explaining the results of a conference) . Travel costs related to an event at which the 
beneficiary carried out work that was not specifically related to the action are NOT eligible.   
All travel costs must be limited to the needs of the action; costs  related to extensions (for 
other professional or private reasons) are NOT eligible.  
Moreover, they must be adequately recorded.  
 be in line with the benefici ary’s usual practices on travel  
 D. Other direct costs [(not covered by Point F)]  
D.1 Travel costs and related subsistence allowances  (including related duties, taxes and charges such as 
non-deductible value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are eligible if they are in line with the 
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.  
[OPTION to be used for trans -national access to research i nfrastructure: Travel costs for providing trans -
national access to research infrastructure are eligible only if also the conditions set out in Article 16.1.1 are 
met.] 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.1  81 Example :  
Beneficiary A declares the cost of a business class airplane ticket for one of its employees.  
If the beneficiary usually pays for staff in this category to travel in business class, then the cost of the 
business class ticket is eligible.  
If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to only pay for economy class t ickets for staff in this category, 
then the cost of the business class ticket is not eligible.  
If the beneficiary reimburses travel and/or subsi stence allowances as a lump sum/ per diem  
payment, it is the lump sum /per diem  amount that is considered an eligi ble cost, NOT the 
actual prices paid by the person receiving the lump sum or per diem . (For the purposes of 
the grant, these lump sum/per diem costs remain actual costs, NOT unit or lump sum 
costs under Article 5.2 . They must be recorded in the beneficiary’s account s and will be 
checked if there is an audit. ) 
 for travel and subsistence costs incurred for providing trans -national access to 
research infrastructure : fulfil the additional cost eligibility  conditions  set out in Article 
16.1. 
1.4 There is no specific calculation  method ; the costs must correspond to the eligible costs 
actually incurred.  
 
Specific cases  (travel costs  (D.1) ): 
Combin ation  with personal travels or travels for other purposes — The cost s of a combined 
travel  can be charged to the action — but ONLY up to the cost that would have been incurred if the 
travel would have been made  exclusively for the action AND if: 
 it is the usual practice of the beneficiary to pay for such travels  (e.g. travels combining 
professional and personal reasons)  
 it has been an actual cost for the beneficiary.  
Example :  
The researcher  flies from Madrid, where the beneficiary is established, to Prague for a project meeting. After 
the meeting, instead of flying back to Madrid , the researcher fli es directly to New York to participate in an event 
not related to the action.  
The beneficiary may c harge to the action:  
 the cost of the flight from Madrid to Prague , and 
 the part of the flight back from New York to Madrid up to the cost  that it would have incurred for  a 
flight back from Prague to Madrid after the end of the project meeting.  
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep evidence not only of the actual cost of the flight back, 
but also of the cost of the flight that the person would have taken if it would have returned directly after 
the end of the work for the action.

This budget category applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants under the General MGA.  
An option for full purchase costs will be inserted into the GA , if explicitly provided in the work 
programme/call . 
The beneficiaries may declare the following types of equipment  costs  as ‘other direct costs – 
equipment costs’ : D.2 [OPTION 1 by default : The depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets  (new or 
second -hand) as recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts are eligible, if they were purchased in accordance 
with Article 10.1.1 and written off in accordance with international accounting standards and the 
beneficiary’s usual accounting practices.  
The costs of  renting or leasing  equipment, infrastructure or other assets (including related duties, taxes and 
charges such as non -deductibl e value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are also eligible, if they do 
not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or assets and do not include any

action and rate of actual use for the purposes of the action. ] 
[OPTION 2 (alternative to option above) to be used if foreseen in the work programme18: The cost of 
purchasing  equipment , infrastructure  or other assets  (new or second -hand) (as recorded in the 
beneficiary’s accounts) are eligible if the equipment, infrastructure or other assets was purchased in 
accordance with Article 10.1.1.  
The costs of renting or leasing equipment,  infrastructure or other assets (including related duties, taxes and 
charges such as non -deductible value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are also eligible, if they do 
not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or asset s and do not include any 
financing fees.  
The costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets contributed in -kind against  payment are eligible, if 
they do not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or assets, do not include an y 
financing fees and if the conditions in Article 11.1 are met. ] 
[OPTION (in addition to one of the two first options above) for trans -national access to research 
infrastructure: As an exception, the beneficiaries must not declare such costs (i.e. costs of  renting, leasing, 
purchasing depreciable equipment, infrastructure and other assets) for providing trans -national access to 
research infrastructure (see Article 16.1). ]  
[OPTION (in addition to one of the two first options above) for virtual access to res earch infrastructure,

 or full purchase costs  of equipment, infrastructure or other assets (if option applies)

1.1 Equipment cost s (D.2) : Depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure or other 
assets  
1.1.1  What?  This budget category covers the depreciation costs of equipment , infrastructure or  
other assets  used for the action .  
In some cases (e.g. infrastructure) , equipment costs may  also include the costs necessary to 
ensure that the asset is in good condition for its intended use (e.g. site preparation, delivery and 
handling, installation, et c.). 
What not?  If the beneficiary’s usual practice is to consider durable equipment costs (or some of 
them) as indirect costs, these can  NOT be declared  as direct costs, but are covered by the 25  % 
flat rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2.E ). Any depreciation declared  as a direct cost under a 
H2020 action must be a direct cost under the beneficiary’s cost accounting practices (see Article 
6.2.)  
1.1.2  Equipment costs must be declared as  actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.1.3  The costs  must comply with the following  eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the 
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, 
etc.; see Article 6.1(a) ) 
 have been purchased  in accordance with Article 10.1 .1 
 be written off  in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual accounting practices  and 
with international accounting standards .  
‘International accounting standards’ are an internationally recognised set of rules for 
maintaining books and reporting company accounts, designed to be compared and 
understood across countries.  
Example:  The IAS  16 (International Accounting Standards) or the  International Financial Reporting 
Standards  (IFRS), originally created by the EU and now in common international use.  
1.1.4 They must be calculated  according to the following  principles : 
 the depreciable amount (purchase price) of the equipment  must be allocated on a 
systematic basis over its useful life (i.e. the period during which the equipment is 
expected to be usable ). If the equipment’s useful life is more than a year , the 
beneficia ry can  NOT charge the total cost  of the item in a single year ( see also ‘cash -
based accounting’ below ) 
 depreciated equipment costs can  NOT exceed  the equipm ent’s purchase price  
 depreciation can  NOT be spread over a period longer than the equipment’s useful life  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6. 2.D.2  84  if the beneficiary does not use the equipment exclusively for the action , only the 
portion used on the action  may be charged. The amount of use must be auditable   
 Example:  A microscope was bought before the action started and was not  fully depreciated. For 6 
months in reporting period 1 it was used for the action for 50  % of the time and for other activities 
for the other 50  % of the time. Linear depreciation is applied according to the beneficiary’s usual 
practices (depreciation over the expected period of use of the microscope): EUR 100  000 per year 
(EUR 50 000 for 6 months).  
Costs declared for the project: EUR  50 000 (6 months of use) multiplied by 50  % of use for the 
action during those 6 months = EUR 25 000.  
 the beneficiary can  NOT charge depreciation for period s before  the purchase of the 
equipment  
Example: A microscope was bought on 1 December. The reportin g period ends on 31 December 
and the financial year also ends on 31 December. The maximum depreciation that the beneficiary 
may charge is 1 month ( from 1 to 31 December) ; i.e. 1/12 of the annual depreciation . This applies 
even if the beneficiary recorded i n its accounts at 31 December a full year of depreciation for the 
item. 
The depreciation costs must be calculated for each reporting period.  
 
Specific cases  (equipment costs  (D.2) ): 
Low-value assets  — The full cost of a low value asset may be eligible in the year when it is purchased 
if: 
 the full cost is recorded in the accounts of the entity as expenditure of that year ( i.e. NOT 
recorded as an asset subject to depreciation)  
and 
 the cost of the asset is below the low -value  ceiling  as defined under national law ( e.g. national 
tax legislation)  or other objective reference compatible with the materiality principle  
and  
 the item is used exclusively for the action  in the year of purchase .  
If the item is not used exclusively for the action  in the year of purchase , only the portion used 
on the action may  be charged.  
Full price of an asset in one single year  — As a general rule , beneficiaries cannot charge the total 
purchase price of equipment to the action, unless the GA explicitly foresees that option. The 
beneficiaries may therefore normally only charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond to the 
part of the equipment’s use for the action. D eclaring its full price in one single year would be  considered 
either as not compliant with the international accounting standards  or as an excessive cost  — and 
therefore  in both cases ineligible ; see ‘cash -based accounting’ below ). 
Equipment bought before the action start — Depreciation costs for equipment used for the action , 
but bought before the action start are eligible if they fulfil the general eligibility conditions of Article 
6.1(a) . These remaining depreciation costs (the equipment has not been fully depreciated before the 
action’s start) may be eligible only for the portion corresponding to the action duration and to the rate 
of actual use for the purposes of the action.  
Example:  
According to the benefi ciary’s accounting practices, a piece of equipmen t bought in January 2013 has a 
depreciation period of 48 months.  
If the GA is signed in January 2015 (when 24 months of depreciation have already passed) and the 
equipment is used for this action, the beneficiary can declare the depreciation costs incurre d for the 
remaining 24 months, in proportion to the equipment’s use for the action.  
Cash -based accounting  — As a general rule, b eneficiaries cannot charge the total purchase price  of 
equipment  to the action,  unless th e GA explicitly foresees th at option. The beneficiaries may therefore 
normally only charge the annual depreciation costs that correspond s to the part of the equipment ’s use 
for the action. This depreciation must be calculated in accordance with international accounting 
standard s (i.e. notably spread over the equipment’s useful life ).  
‘Useful life’ means the time during which the equipment is useful for the beneficiary.  If the 
beneficiary does not normally calculate depreciation i t may  refer to its  national tax regulations  to 
define the useful life of the equipment.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.2  85 Therefore, i f the equipment’s useful life is more than a year , the beneficiary can  NOT charge the full 
price in one single year  (— even if the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice is to record the 
equipment’s total purchase cost as an expense  in one year ). 
Example:  
A beneficiary that uses cash -based accounting buys a machine for EUR 100  000 in March 2015.  According to the 
logbook of the machine, it  is used for the action 50  % of the time from 1 July 2015  until the end of the action . 
The action started in January 2015 and runs for three years with two reporting periods. The machine’s useful life 
is six years.  
In the reporting period ending in June 2016, the beneficiary must declare depreciation  costs taking into account 
the percentage of use, the time used for the action and the machine’s useful life:  
EUR 100  000 x (12/72  months) x 50  % (used for the action) = amount declared  for the machine in the first 
reporting period  
In the reporting period ending in December 2017, the beneficiary must declare:  
EUR 100  000 x (18/72  months) x 50  % (used for the action) = amount declared  for the machine in the 
second reporting period  
Prototype or pilot plants constructed by the beneficiary as part of the action tasks — Normally 
beneficiaries may only declare the depreciation costs for equipment, infrastructure or other assets that 
are used for the project.  
However, ( full) direct costs for construction of a prototype or pilot plant may exceptionally be eligible , if 
all of the following apply:  
 building the prototype or pilot plant is (one of) the main action task(s) as described in Annex 1 
of the GA.  
 the costs are foreseen in the estimated budget (Annex 2 of the GA)  
 the eligibility conditions of Articles 6.1  and 6.2 are met.  
If the beneficiary records the construction costs directly under a fixed assets account in the 
balance sheet rather than as expenses of the year, those costs will normally be considered as 
comp liant with Article 6.1(a)(v) provided that:  
 it is in accordance with the national accounting standards and with the beneficiary’s 
usual cost accounting practices,  
 there is no double charg ing of costs (in particular, no charging of  depreciation costs for 
the prototype or pilot plant to another EU or Euratom grant ). 
 
1.2 Equipment costs  (D.2) : Full c ost of purchasing equipment, infrastructure or other 
assets  
This budget category covers the full purchase costs of capitalised equipment,  infrastructure or 
other assets used for the action (not only the depreciation costs  for the relevant periodic report).  
‘Capitalised’ means recorded as assets in the beneficiary’s balance sheet.  
 
1.3 Equipment costs  (D.2) : Costs of renting or leasing equipment  
1.3.1  What?  This budget category covers the costs of renting or leasing equipment used for the 
action (i.e. finance leasing, renting and operational leasing).  
1.3.2  Equipment costs must be declared as  actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.3.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) ) 
 not exceed  the depreciation costs of similar equipment , infrastructure or assets  
 not include any financing fees .  
1.3.4 They must be calculated  according to the following principles:  
 for leasing (finance leasing) with the option to buy the durable equipment:  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.2  86  the equipment leased by the beneficiary must be recorded as an asset of the 
beneficiary and the depreciation costs may be declared in accordance with the 
beneficia ry’s usual accounting  practices  
 the cost s declared can NOT exceed the costs that would have been incurred if the 
equipment had been purchased and depreciated und er normal accounting practices  
The finance charges included in the finance lease payments are  therefore  NOT 
eligible . 
 the costs declared can  NOT include any interest on loans taken to finance the 
purchase, or any other type of financing fee  
 for renting and operational leasing: the equipment rented or leased by the beneficiary is 
not recorded as an asset of the beneficia ry: There is no depreciation involved ( since the 
item is still the property of the renting or leasing firm), but the rental or lease costs of the 
beneficiary (i.e. its periodic payments to the renting or leasing firm) are eligible, if they 
follow the benef iciary’s usual practices and do not exceed the costs of purchasing the 
equipment (i.e. are not higher than  the depreciation costs of similar equipment).  
 
1.4 Equipment costs  (D.2) : Costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets 
contributed in -kind agai nst payment  
1.4.1  What?  This budget category covers the costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets 
that were used for the action and ‘ contributed in -kind against payment ’. 
1.4.2  Equipment costs must be declared as  actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.4.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a )) 
 not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment , infrastructure or assets  
 not include any financing fees  
 fulfil the  additional cost eligibility conditions  set out in Article 1 1.1. 
1.4.4 The costs must correspond to  the amount paid by the beneficiary and must not exceed the 
depreciation cost of the third party .

1. Costs of other goods and services  (D.3) : Types of costs — Form — Eligibility 
conditions — Calculation  
The budget category applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants  under the General MGA . 
The additional options for access to research infrastructure (together with the corresponding 
Article 16  and other provisions) will be inserted into the GA if the action also involves ac cess to 
research infrastructure.  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for  goods and services that were purchased for 
the action (or contributed in -kind against payment), including : 
 costs for consumables and supplies  (e.g. raw materials  etc.) 
 dissemination costs (including regarding open access to peer -reviewed scientific 
publications , e.g. article processing or equivalent charges , costs related to open access to 
research data and related costs , such as data maintenance or storage  and conference fees 
for presenting project -related research ) 
 costs related to  intellectual property rights (IPR) (including  costs to  protect  the results or 
royalties paid for  access rights  needed to implement the action)  
 costs for certificates on financial statements (CFS) and certificates on methodology  (unless 
unnecessary, for instance because the EU or Euratom contribution is below the threshold of 
Article 20.4  or the certificate was submitted not for the final report but before ). 
 translation costs (if translation is necessary for the action’s implementation, is justified, 
etc.).  
Best practice:  If there is any doubt about whether a cost is eligible, the beneficiaries  should 
contact the Commission/Agency.  
What not?  If it is the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice to consider some of these costs (or 
all of them) as indirect  costs, the y cannot be declared as direct costs (since they will already be  
covered by the 25  % flat rate ). D.3 Costs of other goods and services  (including related duties, taxes and charges such as non -deductible 
value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are eligible, if they are:  
(a) purchased specifically for the action and in accordance with Article 10.1.1 or 
(b) contributed in kind against payment and in accordance with Article 11.1.  
Such goods and services include , for instance, consumables and supplies,  dissemination (including open 
access), protection of results, certificates on the financial statements (if they are required by the Agreement), 
certificates on the methodology, translations and publications.  
[OPTION to be used for trans -national access to research infrastructure: Costs  of other goods and 
services for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  are eligible only if also the 
conditions set out in Article 16.1.1 are met. ] 
[OPTION to be used for virtual access to research infrastructure: Costs of other goods and services for 
providing virtual access to research infrastructure  are eligible only if also the conditions set out in Article 
16.2 are met. ] 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.3  88 1.2 Costs of other goods and services must be declared as  actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.3 The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1 (a)) 
AND  
 be either purchased specifically  for the action and in accordance with Article 
10.1.1  
OR 
 contributed in kind  against payment  and in accordance with Article 11 .1 
 for costs of other goods and services incurred for providing trans -national or virtual 
access to research infrastructure : fulfil the additional cost eligibility  conditions  set 
out in Article 16 .1 or 16.2. 
1.4. There is no specific calculation  method. The costs must correspond to the eligible costs 
actually incurred  (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the goods or services) . 
 
Specific cases  (costs for other goods and services  (D.3) ): 
IPR access rights — Royalties paid for IPR access rights (and by extension any lump sum payments)  
are normally eligible, if all the eligibility conditions are fulfilled  (e.g. necessary for the implementation of 
the action, incurred during the action, reasonable, etc.) .  
The following are however NOT eligible (or eligible only within certain limits):  
 royalties for an exclusive licence: are eligible only if it can be shown that the exclusivity (and 
thus the higher royalties) is absolutely necess ary for the implementation of the action  
 royalties for licensing agreements which were already in force before the start of the action: 
only the part of the licence fee that can be linked to the action is eligible (since the licence 
presumably goes beyond  the action implementation)  
 royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries under Article 25.2 : 
Since t he default rule is that access rights are granted on a royalty -free basis  and b eneficiaries 
may d eviate only if agreed before GA  signature, royalties are eligible only if explicitly agreed by 
all beneficiaries before GA signature  and all the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled  (e.g. 
necessary for the implementation of the action, reasonable, et c.)  
Best practice:  If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is recommended that this is 
explained in detail in their proposal.  
 royalties for access rights to background granted by other beneficiaries under Article 25.3  (and 
by extension royalties paid to third parties for exploitation of the results): are NOT eligible.  
Protection of results  — Costs related to the protection of the actions results (e.g. consulting fees, 
fees paid to the patent office for patent registration; see Article 27 ) are eligible if the eligibility 
conditions are fulfilled. Costs related to protection of other intellectual property ( e.g. background 
patents ) are NOT eligible.  
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results — Costs for drawing up the plan for the 
exploitation and dissemination of the results are normally NOT eligible since they will have been 
incurred before the start of the action, to prepare the proposa l. Costs that occur when revising or 
implementing this plan may be eligible.  
Open access — Costs related to open access to peer -reviewed scientific publications and research data 
are eligible , if the eligibility conditions are fulfilled. With explicit agre ement by the Commission/Agency, 
it can also include fees levied for a membership scheme (if this is a requirement for publishing in open 
access or if membership is a pre -condition for significantly lower article processing charges).  
Supplies in stock — Supplies and consumables which were already in the stock of the beneficiary may 
be eligible as a direct cost, if they are used for the action and fit the definition of direct costs under 
Article 6.2 . 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.3  89 Self-produced consumables with an accounting value in the inventory of the beneficiary  (i.e. 
not internally invoiced costs for goods and services)  — Consumable s that are  manufactured (produced) 
by the beneficiary itself do not have a purchase price ; the cost of production for the b eneficiary is 
however normally recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary (as part of the inventory) . Therefore , the 
eligible costs of self -produced consumables must be determined on the basis of its accounting value 
under the following conditions:  
 only t he direct  costs within  the accounting value of the consumable (cost of production) may be  
charged . If it is not possible to accurately determine th e part of the accounting value 
corresponding to the direct costs  then the beneficiary may charge  the accounting value divided 
by 1,25  (in order to remove the H2020 flat-rate for indirect cost s)  
 
 
AND 
 the amount resulting from the indent above  may not be significantly higher  than the market 
price of the consumable .  
Example:  
In an action in the field of agro -forestry research the beneficiary needs 100 plants to carry out test s. The 
beneficiary has a greenhouse where it keep s a stock of those plants. The market price of those plants (e.g. 
checked with offers or prices published in internet) is around EUR 10 per plant. The beneficiary has 150 plants in 
stock with a global accounting value of EUR  1 200 (=  EUR 8 per plant ). It is not possible to identify what part of 
that a ccounting value corresponds to d irect costs  of production of those plants .  
The beneficiary may use the self -produced plants for the action and charge EUR 6,4 per plant (8/1,25).  
Staff provided by a temporary  work agency — Costs for staff provided by a temporary work agency 
are eligible normally under category D.3 ‘other goods and services’ if they comply with the eligibility 
conditions  (and unless the temporary work agency carries out directly some task of th e action, in which 
case it can be considered as subcontracting and should be declared under category  B ‘subcontracting’) . 
  Beneficiar ies can NOT charge the commercial price  for self-produced consumable s.

1. Capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure  (D.4) : Types of 
costs — Form — Eligibility  conditions  — Calculation  
This optional budget category  will be inserted  into RIA, IA and CSA GAs , unless : 
– it is excluded by the work programme or  
– for calls under Part  I of Horizon 2020 ‘Research Infrastructure s’ (except  for e -
Infrastructure topics).  
1.1. What?  It covers capitalised costs  and operating costs  of research infrastructure used for 
the action.  
‘Capitalised costs’ are:  
 all costs incurred in setting up and/or renewing the research infrastructure and  
 some costs of specific repair and maintenance of the research infrastructure and parts or 
essential integral components.20  
These costs are recorded as an asset in the balance sheet and expensed over the years. They 
can be claimed as direct costs through depreciation costs. The capitalised costs of the research 
infrastructure must be depreciated in line with international accounting standards (in 
                                            
20  See also International Financial Reporting Standard No 16.  D.4 Capitalised and operating costs of ‘large research infrastructure ’19 [OPTION 1 by default: directly 
used for the action are eligible , if: 
(a)  the value of the large research infrastructure  represents at least 75% of the total fixed assets (at 
historical value in its last closed balance sheet  before the date of the signature of the Agreement or 
as determined on the basis of the rental and leasing costs of the research infrastructure20); 
(b)  the beneficiary’s methodology for declaring the costs for large research infrastructure has been 
positively assessed by the Commission ( ‘ex-ante assessment ’); 
(c)  the beneficiary declares as direct eligible costs only the portion which corresponds to the duration 
of the action and the rate of actual use for the purposes of the action, and  
(d)  they comply with the conditions  as further detailed in the an notations to the H2020 grant  
agreements .] 
OPTION 2 for all topics within calls under Part ‘Research Infrastructure’  (except for e -Infrastructure 
topics): Not applicable. ] 
[OPTION 3 to be used if foreseen in the work programme: Not applicable .] 
 
19  ‘Large research infrastructure ’ means research infrastructure of a total value of at least EUR 20 million, for a beneficiary, calculated 
as the sum of historical asset values of each individual research infrastructure of that beneficiary, as they appear in its l ast closed balance 
sheet before the date of the signature of the Agreement or as determined on the basis of the rental and leasing costs of the research 
infrastructure.  
20  For the definition see Article 2(6) of the ‘H2020 Framework Programme Regulation No 1291/2013 ’: ‘Research infrastructure’  are 
facilities, resources and services that are used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in the ir fields. 
Where relevant, they may be used beyond research, e.g. for education or public  services. They include: major scientific equipment (or 
sets of instruments); knowledge -based resources such as collections, archives or scientific data; e -infrastructures such as data and 
computing systems and communication networks; and any other infrast ructure of a unique nature essential to achieve excellence in 
research and innovation. Such infrastructures may be ‘single -sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article  6.2.D.4  91 particular, based on the useful economic life of the infrastructure) and  with the beneficiary’s 
usual accounting practices.21 Only the depreciation costs of the research infrastructure 
corresponding to actual use may be declared as eligible direct costs.  
Methods and national reporting practices may differ, but, for the declaration of costs under 
H2020 grants, it is these guidelines that must be followed for the financial reporting.  
Beneficiaries must use their ‘usual accounting principles’, i.e.  the general and cost 
accounting principles, standards and procedures that th ey use to compile their 
legal/statutory financial accounts (i.e.  balance sheet, profit and loss accounts, etc.) 
together with their analytical management information. These standards and principles 
must not be set up specifically for declaring costs under EU-funded actions. They should be 
changed/adapted only where strictly necessary to comply with the EU cost eligibility 
conditions. Ad hoc accounting and/or management schemes will not be accepted.  
The costs of renting and/or leasing (excluding any finance fee/interest)  of a research 
infrastructure may also be declared as eligible direct costs. As regards depreciation, only 
leasing costs of the research infrastructure corresponding to actual use may be declared as 
eligible direct costs.  
 
 
 
 
‘Operating costs’ are costs:  
 which the beneficiary incurs specifically (i.e.  directly for the research infrastructure that is 
used for the action) for running the research infrastructure (including scientific, technical 
and administrative personnel) and  
 are directly linked to the res earch infrastructure.  
In the statutory accounting, these are recorded in the beneficiary’s  statement of 
comprehensive income (profit and loss account).  
Only the following operating costs can be claimed as direct costs:  
 personnel cost of administrative and  support staff directly assigned to the functioning 
of the research infrastructure;  
 rental/lease of the research infrastructure (for the period of its actual use for the 
action);  
 maintenance and repair contracts (including calibrating and testing) specific ally 
awarded for the functioning of the research infrastructure;  
 consumables, materials and spare parts specifically used for the research 
infrastructure;  
 facility management contracts including security fees, insurance costs, quality control 
and certifica tion, upgrading to national and/or EU quality, safety or security standards 
(if not capitalised), specifically awarded for the functioning of the research 
infrastructure;  
 energy and water specifically supplied for the research infrastructure.  
 
                                            
21  See Article 126 of the Financial Regulation  No 966/2012 . 
  If a (tenant) beneficiary uses the values of contracts of renting or leasing of a research infrastructure to 
calculat e the EUR 20 million threshold (see below)  and therefore  declares costs for this infrastructure, these 
costs cannot be considered nor declared by any other beneficiary under any other H2020 grant (in particular 
not by the owner of the research infrastructure).

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  92 What not?  The following costs can NOT be declared as direct costs (non -exhaustive list):  
 rental, lease or depreciation of buildings or plants not directly used for the action (e.g. 
administrative buildings, headquarters)  
 statutory audit and legal fees (not including c osts of certificates required under the GA)  
 office supplies and petty office equipment  (purchased in bulk)  
 other general services  (cleaning, medical, library, services for publication, communication 
and connection, postage, dues and subscriptions, clothing , literature, transport, catering 
and similar items (i.e. items recorded by the beneficiary under the same account in the 
general ledger)  
 management tasks  and horizontal services (accounting and controlling, head office, 
corporate communications, HR and tr aining, internal audit, management, quality 
management, strategic development, etc.)  
 non-specific, non -activity -related or non -project -related costs (general): consumables, 
maintenance, general facilities management, conferences, hosted activities, security fees, 
insurance costs, general utilities, energy and water, and similar (i.e. items recorded by the 
beneficiary under the same account in the general ledger).  
These costs are reimbursed through the flat -rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2 .E). 
1.2 Costs of capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure must be declared  as 
actual costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.3 The costs  must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 they fulfil  the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the 
action duration, necessary, linked to the ac tion, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) ) 
 the sum of historical asset values of each individual research infrastructure  of the 
beneficiary,  as they appear in its last closed balance sheet before the date of the signature 
of the GA or as determined on the basis of the rental and leasing costs of the research 
infrastructure, represents a tot al value of at least EUR 20 million for that beneficiary  
 the value of large research infrastructure s of the beneficiary represents at least 75% 
of the total fixed assets (at historical value in its last closed balance sheet  before the date 
of the signature  of the GA or as determined on the basis of the rental and leasing costs of 
the research infrastructure)  
 the beneficiary’s methodology for declaring the costs for large research infrastructure has 
been positively assessed by the Commission ( ‘ex-ante assess ment ’); 
 the beneficiary declares as direct eligible costs only the portion  which corresponds to the 
action duration and to the rate of actual use  for the purposes of the action, and  
 they comply with the conditions  set out below . 
 
 
 
 
1.4 The calculation  is explained in point 4.4.  
 
 
  The beneficiary must operate research infrastructure that falls under the definition of large research 
infrastructure (i.e. a total value of at least EUR 20 million and representing at least 75% of the total fixed 
assets). If this is the case, the value of the specific research infrastructure used for the action  (and 
for which costs are declared) is irrelevant  (i.e. it can be lower or higher than EUR 20 million) (see also 
below point 2) . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  93 2. Large research infrastructure  (LRI)   
Beneficiaries can declare capit alised and operating costs for large research infrastructure , if 
they comply with the definition and conditions listed in Article 6.2 .D.4 (in particular if the large 
research infrastructure has a total value of at least EUR 20 million22 and if the value of the large 
research infrastructure represents at least 75% of the beneficiary’s total fixed assets, at historical 
value).  
The values of contracts of renting or leasing of research infrastructure may be taken into 
account  for the calculation of the EUR 20 million threshold of the (tenant) beneficiary (see 
above) .  
The infrastructure used for the action must be a research infra structure  in technical terms, i.e. 
a facility, resource or service that is used by the research communities to conduct research and 
foster innovation in their fields; it may be used beyond research, e.g. for education or public 
services23. 
This covers for i nstance:  
 major scientific equ ipment (or sets of instruments) ; 
 knowledge -based resources such as collectio ns, archives or scientific data ; 
 e-infrastructures, such as data, and computing systems, and communication 
networks.  
The infrastructure may be ‘single -sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’.  
Moreover, it must be a research infrastructure in accounting terms, i.e. recorded in the accounts 
of the beneficiary on the basis of a grouping of costs  (comprising a wide range of items: 
buildings, machinery, eq uipment, IT, staff, repair and maintenance, specific security fees, etc.), 
specifically dedicated to the research infrastructure and necessary for it/them to function, and 
excluding costs that are incidental to the research infrastructure or necessary for accessing it, 
such as a car parks, conference and teaching rooms.  
In analytical (cost) accounting, this grouping of costs can be recorded in many different ways.  
Best practice : Recording them with a specific code for the research infrastructure or under a  cost 
centre.  
 
3. Ex -ante assessment  
Only beneficiaries that have obtained a positive ex -ante assessment of their costing methodology 
may declare capitalised and operating costs for large research infrastructure  under this budget 
category . 
 
 
 
 
 
                                            
22  Calculated as the sum of the historical asset values of the individual research infrastructures as they appear in 
the beneficiary’s last closed balance sheet before the date on which the grant agreement is signed, or 
determined on the basis of the rental and leasing costs of the infrastructures.  
23  See Article 2( 6) of the H orizon 2020 Framework Programme.  
 Recalculations & adjustments  of financial statements ( exceptional)  — Costs can be declared under 
this budget category ONLY after  having obtained the positive ex -ante assessment from the Commission . Once 
obtained, the beneficiaries may, however, exceptionally adjust previous financial statements . 
 Costs declared in accordance with a positive ex -ante assessment w ill not be challenged during audits , except 
in case of irregularity or  fraud. The auditors will  only:  
 ensure that the methodology used is the one that was submitted for ex -ante assessment and 
 verify that the calculations (applying the methodology ) are correct.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  94 When?  Applications for ex -ante assessment can be submitted at any time during grant 
preparation for any GA (by ticking the LRI box either in the Participant Register  or during grant 
preparation) .  
How?  The ex-ante assessment  is composed of two steps: Status validation and methodology 
compliance.  
Procedure for ex -ante assessment:   
Step 1  —  Status validation  (i.e. if the beneficiary qualifies with definition and c onditions  for 
declaring costs under Article 6.2.D.4 ). 
The beneficiary must self -declare whether it complies with the conditions set out 
above (in particular the EUR 20 million and the 75% thresholds), by filling the 
appropriate field  in the Participant Register . The beneficiary must then provide the 
relevant supporting documents to the Commission within one month.  
The Commission will con firm or — after a contradictory procedure — refuse the 
status and inform the beneficiary accordingly.  
Step 2  —  Methodology compliance  (i.e. if the beneficiary’s methodology complies with the 
conditions set out below) . 
Following an in -depth (in principle on -the-spot) assessment, the Commission will 
issue a draft report and submit it to a contradictory procedure with the beneficiary. 
During this phase the b eneficiary has the possibility to amend its methodology by 
removin g any non -compliant component of it. Thereafter, a final (negative or 
positive) ex-ante assessment  report will be issued.  
 
4. Other  conditions  
4.1 Costs must be identifiable and verifiable  
All declared costs must be identifiable and verifiable , i.e. supported by persuasive evidence 
allowing for a sufficient audit trail.  
The sufficiency and the persuasiveness of the evidence provided, as well as the audit trail, will 
be assessed against the International Standards on Auditing . 
Capitalised costs  claimed as depreciation costs must be supported by:  
 proper regis tration in the assets’ register  
 evidence of act ual use for the action,  e.g. through time registration  
 adequate calculation of potent ial use (total productive time)  
 adequate calculation of the us eful economic life of the asset  
 evidence that depreciation is calculated in line with the beneficiary’s usual  accounting 
principles and the applicable accounting standards.  
4.2 Costs must be incurred in direct relationship with the research infrastructure and 
with the action  
 Although the ex -ante assessment is granted at entity level, it does not necessarily mean that it  covers the 
entire legal entity from the beginning of H2020. It may cover only some departments, cost centres or even 
individual infrastructures of the beneficiary, possibly with different starting dates.  
In that case, the beneficiary may use budget catego ry D.4 only for cost items that are covered by the positive 
assessment (i.e. that use the methodology and comply with  the conditions of the approval).

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  95 Beneficiaries cannot declare  their full organisational or general operating costs, even i f they are 
fully research -oriented (e.g. a research organisation, technical university, research enterprise) . 
These costs are covered by the flat -rate for indirect costs (see Article 6.2 .E). 
Only costs that have been incurred in direct relationship  with the research infrastructure and 
that are necessary for the implementation of the action can be claimed as direct costs in category 
D.4 ‘large research infrastructure’ .  
This applies if:  
 for capitalised costs: the implementation of the action specifically requires the use  of 
the research infrastructure  
 for operating costs: the functioning of the research infrastructure specifically requires 
the assignment of administrative and support staff, o r the award of service or supply 
contracts.  
Beneficiaries must be able to demonstrate eligibility by means of an audit trail and sufficient 
evidence, such as:  
 their usual mana gement practices and procedures  
Only written and consigned practices and procedur es which are part of the beneficiary’s 
internal control framework will be accepted. Oral statements will not be accepted.  
 internal management exchanges necessary for the approv al of an underlying transaction  
 purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, proo f of payment or any other evidence of 
exchanges between the client and the provider(s) before  signatu re of the contract or 
agreement  
The beneficiary must prove the reality of the underlying transaction ( including  the absence 
of a credit note or back -payment offsetting the transaction). Gathering such evidence may 
require a comprehensive analysis of the beneficiary’s general ledger.  
 for works contracts, any statement of work in progress, delivery status or assembli ng 
overview.  
The evidence mentioned in the last three points must be explicitly linked to the specific 
research infrastructure and/or action, and to the specific cost item.   
Beneficiaries may prove the direct link through alternative persuasive evidence. T he sufficiency 
and the persuasiveness of the alternative evidence provided, as well as the audit trail, will be 
assessed against the International Standards on Auditing.  
Example 1 (link between research infrastructure and action(s)):  
A beneficiary involved  in different research areas owns several research infrastructures:  an oceanographic 
vessel and a laboratory for microbiological analysis.  
Costs relating to the oceanographic vessel cannot be claimed as direct costs for an action for which it is not used 
(e.g. an action on eradicating malaria in Africa or on setting up a network for social intelligence).  
Part of the costs of the vessel  can however be claimed where the vessel is used for an action (e.g.  an action 
on seismic oceanography or on the oceanic eco system), provided the beneficiary demonstrates the extent of use 
(e.g. through a board -book).  
Similarly, part of the laboratory costs  can be claimed for an action on eradicating malaria in Africa or on the 
oceanic ecosystem, provided the beneficiary demonstrates the extent to which the laboratory is used for the 
action.  
The costs of the two research infrastructures cannot be declared fo r the action on setting up the network for 
social  intelligence.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  96 
 
4.3 Costs must not be included as direct costs in any other category  
Costs may not be declared twice (see Article 6.5 )24.  
Thus:  
 any (part of a) cost item that has been capitalised and recorded as an asset is de facto  
included in the depreciation costs of the infrastructure and cannot be declared in another 
cost category (e.g. if the capitalised costs of installing a large telescope are depreciated, 
they cannot be declared as operating costs)  
 (part of) the costs of an inf rastructure that have already been declared in respect of 
another EU /Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State, or by bodies 
other than the Commission for the purpose of implementing the EU /Euratom budget) 
cannot be declared again (e.g. cos ts already declared in an FP7 action to set up or renew 
an infrastructure; costs already declared in an action under the ‘Research Infrastructures’ 
Part of Horizon 2020 with (i.e. providing of trans -national access to research 
infrastructure; see Article 16 ); costs already declared in a grant co -financed by the 
Structural Funds or the ESIF Funds)   
This means that a cost item  already declared  under a Structural Funds or ESIF grant 
cannot be declared again under the H2020 g rant. However, cost items that have not 
already been declared  under a Structural Funds or ESIF grant, may be declared under the 
H2020 grant, even if they belong to the same action.  
 
 
 
4.4 Costs must be directly measured  
Costs can be claimed as direct costs in category D.4 ‘Large research infrastructure’ only if they are 
directly measured  (i.e. directly quantified by a monetary value assigned to a given cost item, or 
a share of it) . The measurement system used by the benef iciary must accurately quantify the cost 
(i.e. reflect its actual true value), be supported by sufficient persuasive evidence and be auditable.  
This is considered to be the case if the unit of measurement (generally obtained from the 
supplier’s invoice) is that used to measure the direct consumption of the item.  
This measurement must be accurate (i.e. show the real consumption and/or use of a cost ite m 
on the action), therefore only actual elements of cost and consumption or use are accepted.  
Direct measurement of costs does NOT mean ‘fair apportionment ’ through proxies or cost 
drivers — which was standard for declaring real indirect costs under FP7. (Fair apportionment 
is not a measurement but an attempt to estimate the costs that were incurred for an action.  
Direct measurement implies that a cost cannot be attributed to projects via an allocation key, 
a cost driver or a proxy.)  
                                            
24  See Article 129(1) of the Financial Regulation  No 966/2012 . 
 Combining H2020 & other EU grants  — The terminologies  under the different EU 
funds/funding programmes may differ (e.g. ‘capitalised costs’ under Horizon 2020 versus 
‘investment costs’ under the Structural Funds, etc.) . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  97  
Example 2 ( comparison  between fair apportionment and direct measurement):  
Under the fair apportionment method, the general electricity costs of a beneficiary operating a laboratory 
used for an action are allocated to the pool of indirect cost and then apportioned fairly via an absorption 
method (e.g. m2). 
Under the direct measurement method, the cost is claimed as direct cost; however the beneficiary must 
ensure that the electricity invoice specifies the electricity costs for the research infrastructure (explicitly 
labelled invoice or separate invoice). Moreover, the cost must then be measured with respect to the actual 
time of use of the research infrastructure for the action.  
 
While accurate measurement systems may differ depending on the nature of the cost, they will 
norm ally involve time  actually used for the action ( project time ) and therefore require 
reliable time recording (through time -sheets, logbooks, counters, etc.). The measurement 
system must be justifiable through sufficient persuasive evidence and auditable.  
Project time must correspond:  
 for the costs of administrative and support staff directly assigned to the functioning 
of the research infrastructure: to the number of hours actually worked for the 
action, measured and documented in accordance with Article 31  of the Rules for 
Participation Regulation No  1290/2013     
 for the other costs of the research infrastructure: to the number of 
hours/days/months of actual use of the research infrastructure for the action as a 
part of full capacity (i .e. the number of productive hours/days/months 
corresponding to the full poten tial use of the infrastructure)   
This includes any time durin g which the research infrastructure is usable but not 
used, but take due account of real constraints such as the opening hours of the 
entity, repair and maintenance time (including calibrating and testing) due to 
research activities . 
If a cost can be directly measured to the research infrastructure but — because of 
technical constraints — cannot be measured directly to the action, beneficiaries 
may measure costs by means of ‘ units of actual usage ’ for the action, supported 
by accurate technical specifi cations and actual data and determined on the basis of 
the beneficiary’s analytical cost accounting system. Th is data must be regularly 
updated.  
Example 3 ( costs of administrative and support staff directly assigned to the 
functioning of the research infra structure):  
If an employee of the administration and finance department is employed to carry out 
specific tasks necessary for the operation of a research infrastructure  specifically used for an 
action (e.g.  assigning time -slots between users, monitoring ac tual use, managing security 
contracts), the personnel costs can be declared as direct costs of the action, in proportion to 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Arti cle 6.2.D.4  98 the time the employee actually spent on the action and provided that this is recorded 
reliably.  
 
Example 4 ( part-time use of the research infrastructure for the action):  
 
An oceanographic vessel is used full -time for a period of two months for an EU - funded 
action and three months for a non -EU research project (or for a non -research activity 
(commercial, industrial, etc.) of the beneficiary) and stays idle for seven months.  
If the annual costs of the vessel (i.e. capitalised and operating costs) amount to EUR 120 
000, the part that can be declared for  the EU funded action is:  
(EUR 120 000 / 12 months) x 2 months = EUR 20 000  
AND N OT: 
(EUR 120 000 / 5 months25) x 2 months = EUR 48 000  
Renting or leasing costs can be directly measured to an action as follows:  
Example 5 ( rental/leasing costs):  
The surface area of the premises rented/leased by a beneficiary is occupied as follows:  
* 50  % by a research infrastructure;   
* 50  % by conference rooms and offices.  
The overall rental/leasing costs are EUR 100  000 per year, split (according to the rental/leasing 
agreement) as follows:  
* EUR 80  000 for the research infrastructure;  
* EUR 20  000 for  the conference rooms and offices.  
The rental costs that can be claimed as direct costs for an action using this research 
infrastructure are determined as follows:  
Step 1  Calculation of the rental costs that can be directly attributed to the research 
infrastructure  
On the basis of the rental/leasing agreement, the invoice must refer to separate 
amounts for the research infrastructure and the conference rooms/offices (the 
rental/leasing costs cannot be directly allocated on the basis of the respective 
surface areas).  
                                            
25  5 months = 2 months for an EU funded  action  + 3 months for non -EU research or other activities.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.4  99 The basis for the calculation must be EUR 80  000 and not EUR  50 000 (EUR 
100 000 x 50  % of m²).  
Step 2  The rental/leasing amount invoiced for the research infrastructure (i.e. 
EUR 80 000) is precisely distributed between the activity(ies) and p roject(s) 
that make use of it ( best practice:  time of actual use) . Installed usage 
capacity is taken (so as not to exclude idle time) and the resulting cost per 
unit of usage is multiplied by actual usage on the action (which thus absorbs 
its share of the overall renting/leasing cost).  
Best practices (for direct measurement ): 
 Depreciation (for capitalised costs): accounting statements accompanied by the beneficiary’s 
depreciation policy (under its usual accounting principles), to show adequate calculation of 
the potential use of the asset (total productive time based on full ca pacity) + calculation of 
the useful economic life of the asset, evidence of project time (or units of actual usage for 
the action) and evidence of the actual use of the asset for the action  
 Rental or lease of the research infrastructure: specific explicitl y labelled rental or lease 
invoice/contract; adequate calculation of the potential use of the asset (total productive time 
based on full capacity) + calculation of the useful economic life of the asset, evidence of 
project time (or units of actual usage fo r the action) and evidence of the actual use of the 
asset for the action  
 Personnel (administrative and support staff): time recording (without prejudice to the need 
for persuasive evidence of ac tual involvement in the action)  
 Maintenance and repair (includ ing calibrating and testing): specific explicitly labelled invoice 
relating to the research infrastructure + project time (or units of actual usage for the action)  
 Consumables, materials and spare parts: specific explicitly labelled invoice relating to the  
research infrastructure, if available, or stocktaking; actual consumption for the action (based 
on analytical cost accounting) or project time (or units of actual usage for the action)  
 Facilities management, including security fees, insurance costs, quali ty control and 
certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality, safety or security standards: specific 
explicitly labelled invoice relating to the research infrastructure + project time (or units of 
actual usage for the action)  
 Energy and water: spe cific explicitly labelled invoice relating to the research infrastructure + 
project time (or units of actual usage for the action).  
The energy consumption of a specific research infrastructure can be obtained from the 
measured consumption (e.g. number of k ilowatts per hour of use) , as stated in its techn ical 
specifications  or provided by the supplier or an independent body. These specifications must 
be identifiable and verifiable.  
Alternative  to best practice s: The beneficiaries may determine eligible direc t costs on the basis 
of an aggregate of the capitalised and operating direct costs of each research infrastructure.  
Direct measurement allows to determine a ‘ cost per unit of use ’ covering all the actual direct 
costs relating to the operation of the research infrastructure being used for the action, 
i.e. depreciation costs plus necessary operating costs of the research infrastructure.  
This cost remains however  an actual  cost, NOT a unit cost under Article 5.2 . 
The cost p er unit of use must be calculated as follows:  
{all capitalised costs of the research infrastructure + all operating costs of the research infrastructure}  
total annual capacity  
The unit of use must correspond to:  
(i)  the time of use expressed in hours, days or m onths and supported by evidence  or 
(ii)  the number of accesses, for which supporting evidence may take the form of records or electronic 
log of units -of-access provision.  
The calculation must take due account of real constraints (e.g. opening hou rs), but must 
reflect the research infrastructure’s full capacity and include  any time during which the 
research infrastructure is usable but not used or any unit of access available but not used .

1. Costs of internally invoiced goods and services (D .5): Types of costs — Form — 
Eligibility conditions — Calculation  
The budget category  applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants under the General MGA.  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for  goods and services which the  beneficiary 
itself produced or provided for  the action . They include (non -exhaustive list):  
 self-produced consumables (e.g. electronic wafers, chemicals)  
 use of specific research devices or research facilities (e.g. clean room, wind tunnel, 
supercomputer facilities, electronic microscope)  
 specialised premises for hosting the research specimens us ed for the action (e.g. animal 
house, greenhouse, aquarium)  
 standardised testing or research processes (e.g. genomic test, mass spectrometry 
analysis)  
 hosting services for visiting researchers participating in the action (e.g. housing, canteen ).  
What not?  Costs of goods of services purchased and costs of goods or services internally invoiced 
which are not directly used for the action (e.g. supporting services like cleaning, general 
accountancy, administrative support, etc.) . 
1.2 Costs of internally invoice d goods and services must be declared as  unit costs (see Article 
5.2(d) ). 
1.3 The costs must comply with the following cumulative eligibility conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. used during the action 
duration, necessary  for the action , identifiable and verifiable, etc.; see Article 6.1( b)) D.5 Costs of internally invoiced goods and services  directly used for the action  are eligible, if:  
(a) they are declared on the basis of a unit cost calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual 
cost accounting practices;  
 
(b) the cost accounting practices used are applied in a consistent manner, based on objective criteria, 
regardless of the source of funding;  
 
(c) the unit cost is calculated using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s 
accounts, excluding an y ineligible cost or costs included in other budget categories.  
 
The actual costs may be adjusted by the beneficiary on the basis of budgeted or estimated elements. 
Those elements must be relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and correspond to obj ective 
and verifiable information;  
(d) the unit cost excludes any costs of items which are not directly linked to the production of the 
invoiced goods or service.  
 
‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided by the benef iciary 
directly for the action and which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting practices.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.5  102  
 
 
 
 be in line with the  beneficiary’s  usual cost accounting practice s  
It must be the usual practice of the beneficiary to calculate a unit cost for that good or 
service (i.e. an internal cost per unit invoiced to other departments of the same entity – 
not prices charged in the context of commercial sales or grants from other fund providers ). 
 the cost accounting practices must have been  applied in a consistent  manner, based on 
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding  
The beneficiary must consistently apply its usual cost accounting practices, based on 
objective criteria that must be verifiable if there is an audit. It must  do this no matter who 
is funding the action .  
Example:  if the beneficiary sets up a new unit cost which applies only to EU actions, the internally 
invoiced costs based on that new unit cost would be ineligible.  
 the amount per unit  must have been  calculate d using the actual costs recorded in the 
beneficiary’s accounts, excluding any ineligible cost s or costs already included in other 
budget categories  
If necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to  remove : 
 cost elements that are ineligible under the GA (even if they are part of the 
beneficiary’s  usual  methodology for determining the unit cost  for its internal 
invoices)   
Example:  The beneficiary uses internal invoices for the use of an electronic microscope  based on a 
unit cost per hour of use. The method ology to calculate the unit cost includes costs of capital (e.g. 
interest charged by the bank for a loan used to buy the microscope). Those costs are ineligible 
under the GA (see Article 6.5 ) and must therefore be removed . The unit cost must be recalculated 
without them . 
 
 
 
 
 
 costs of resources that do not belong to the beneficiary and which it uses free of 
charge (e.g. personnel or equipment of a third party provided  free of charge) ,  
because  they are not in its accounts  (see Article 6.1(a)(v) ) 
As an exception, if the resource for which the unit cost is calculated is co -owned by 
the beneficiary and a third part y, the costs registered in the accounts of the third 
party for the co-owned resource do not need to be removed if:  
 the third part y is mentioned in the grant  (e.g. as third party providing in-
kind contribut ions in Annex 1 ) and 
 the costs fulfil the other eligibility conditions of this Article (e.g. directly 
linked to the resource, exclude ineligible costs, etc .). 
 costs that are already included in other budget categories (double funding of the 
same costs , see Article 6.1(a)(i) ).  
Example:  The beneficiary uses internal invoices for water chemistry analyses, based on  a unit cost 
per water sample analysed. The methodology to calculat e the unit cost includes the cost of the 
staff carryi ng out the analysis . However , the costs for those persons are already charged to the 
 A beneficiary can  NOT simply apply a n estimated  percentage of deduction on the amount of 
its internal invoices to remove ineligible costs. It has to ensure that the internal invoice does 
not include  any ineligible costs under the GA .  
 
 
 
 
 It is NOT necessary to have a document called ‘internal invoice’ to support these costs, but the 
beneficiary should have a documented methodology how to determine them (such a methodology 
must be part of its usual costs accounting practices). The beneficiary mu st also keep supporting 
evidence of the use of the good or service for the action.

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.D.5  103 action under direct personnel costs  (category A.1) . The cost of th e staff must therefore  be removed 
and the unit cost must be recalculated without them . 
 if budgeted or estimated  elements  were used to calculate the amount per unit , those 
elements must : 
 be relevant (i.e. clearly related to invoiced item) 
 be used in a reasonable way (i.e. do not  play major role in calculating the unit cost ) 
 correspond to objective and verif iable information (i.e. their basis is clearly defined 
and the beneficiary can show how they were calculated ) 
 the amount per unit must have been calculated using only cost s of items which were 
directly linked  to the production of the internally invoiced goods or services (e.g. staff, 
equipment, raw materials, etc.)  
 
If a cost item is not used exclusively for the internally invoiced good or service, only the 
share used for the good or service may be counted (the percentage taken must be 
substantiated by persuasive evidence ). 
 
Example: Shared staff — Among the persons operating the beneficiary’s wind tunnel , there is one 
person that is  assigned only part -time to that wind tunnel;  the rest of the time it works in another 
department. If the beneficiary includes the costs of this person  at the rate of 50 % , it must be able to 
justify the reality of that percentage , for example, by any of the following:  
 reliable time  recording system  
 a statistic survey performed in the past based on actual data 
 detailed calculations based on technical specifications or other scientific and technical 
requirements of the equipment or infrastructure allowing to reconcile the time spent by 
the person for the functioning of the wind tunnel  
or 
 a combination of the se methods .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If necessary, the unit cost must be adjusted to remove c osts elements allocated  to the unit 
cost indirectly ; i.e. through cost drivers /allocation keys  based on other cost items  included 
in the unit cost  (e.g. for  a clean room : the costs of the of the human resources department 
charged to the unit cost as a fixed amount per employee assigned to the clean room ; or 
power supply costs allocated to the clean room on the basis of the square meters it 
occupies) . 
Example:  Costs for an animal housing facility  
 
Examples of costs generally  eligible  as part of 
the unit cost  Examples of costs ineligible  as part of the unit 
cost 
– staff working for the facility (e.g. keepers, 
veterinarians and other persons directly 
assigned to run the animal house)  
– consumables used for the animal housing 
(e.g. animal food, bedding)  
– depreciation of cages and other 
equipment directly linked to the housing of 
the animals  
– generic supplies like electricity or water —
BUT only if the consumption of the facility – cost of central services (e.g. accounting 
department, human resources department)  
– shared infrastructures (e.g. central heating, 
air-conditioning) and their maintenance  
– shared services  with no differentiation of 
the costs incurred for the animal house 
facility (e.g. cleaning services)  
– depreciation of shared buildings (e.g. the 
animal housing is part of a main building of 
the beneficiary)  
 Ceiling — The (share of the) working time  of a person which is included in the calculation of 
the unit cost reduces the number of hours that the person can charge over the year to 
EU/Euratom grants (see Article 6.2.A. Ca lculation) . The same hours of the person cannot be 
charged twice to the grant, once embedded in the unit cost and again as direct personnel costs.

1. Indirect costs  (E.): Types of costs  — Form — Eligibility c onditions — Calculation  
This budget category applies to all RIA, IA and CSA grants under the General MGA.  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  all costs for the action that are not directly  linked to it 
(see Article 6.2 ). 
1.2 Indirect costs must be declared as a fixed flat-rate ( see Article 5.2(e) ; 
 new in Horizon 
2020).  
In practice, the declaration is completely automati zed: The indirect costs are automatically 
calculated by the IT system  (on the basis of the direct costs) .  
 
1.3 The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for flat -rate costs to be eligible (i.e. costs to which the flat -
rate is applied must be eligible, correct calculation , etc.; see Article 6.1(c) ) 
1.4 They must be calculated by applying the 25 % flat -rate to the beneficiary’s eligible direct 
costs, minus:  
 subcontracting costs (see Article 13 ) 
Example:  subcontracting of opinion surveys  
The purchase of goods, work or services that are not  action tasks described in Annex 1 
(see Article 10 ) is NOT considered subcontracting, and are therefore not subtracted when 
calculating the 25  % flat rate . E. Indirect costs [(not covered by Point F)]  
Indirect costs  are eligible if they are declared on the basis of the flat-rate of 25% of the eligible direct costs 
(see Article 5.2  and Article 6.2 . Points A to D above), from which are excluded:  
(a)  costs of subcontracting [and][;]    
(b) costs of in -kind contributions provided by third parties which are not used on the beneficiary’s 
premises [and][;]   
(c) [OPTION 1 to be used if Article 15 applies: costs of providing financial support to third 
parties[and][;]][ OPTION 2 : not applicab le;] 
(d) [OPTION 1 if Article 6.2.F applies and the specific unit cost[/lump sum] cost covers indirect 
costs: [unit costs under Articles 5.2(f) and 6.2.F.][lump sum costs under Articles 5.2(f) and 
6.2.F.]] [ OPTION 2:  not applicable.]  
Beneficiaries receiving an  operating grant21 financed by the EU or Euratom budget cannot declare indirect 
costs for the period covered by the operating grant, unless they can demonstrate that the operating grant 
does not cover any costs of the action.  
 
21  For the definition, see Article 121(1)(b) of the Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC , 
Euratom) No 1605/2002 ( ‘Financial Regulation No  966/2012 ’)(OJ L 218, 26.10.2012, p.1) : ‘operating grant ’ means direct financial 
contribution, by way of donation, from the  budget in order to finance the functioning of a body which pursues an aim of general EU 
interest or has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy.  
 The pre-filled amount may NOT be changed (except in case of a parallel operating grant,  see below ). 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  106  costs of in -kind contributions incurred by third parties outsid e of the  beneficiary’s premises  
 costs of providing financial support to third parties (if option applies)  
 costs from specific cost categories ( unit or lump  sum costs ) that include indirect costs  (e.g. 
‘costs for energy efficiency measures in buildings’, ‘ access costs for providing trans -
national access to research infrastructure’ and  ‘costs for clinical studies’) . 
 
Example for calculating indirect costs:  
A public university is a beneficiary under a GA and has incurred the following costs : 
 EUR 100  000 personnel costs (EUR 7  000 of which are an in -kind contribution in the form of  a laboratory 
technician who carries out work for the action from his/her laboratory in a public research centre)  
 EUR 20  000 subcontracting costs,   
 EUR 10  000 other direct costs (consumables) . 
Eligible direct costs: 100 000 + 20  000 + 10  000 = EUR 130  000  
Eligible indirect costs: 25  % of (100  000 – 7 000 + 10  000) = EUR 25  750 
Total eligible costs: EUR 155  750  
  Combining different  EU grants  — Beneficiaries that have action  grants  and operating grants may 
claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they are  able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. that the ir 
operating grant s do not cover any costs which are covered by  their action  grants ). 
Operating grants are annual grants to finance the operation and running costs of an entity (e.g. call  
COMM -C2/01 -2013 under the Europe for Citizens programme) .  
Example:  Entity A receives an operating grant under the Europe for Citizens programme for the financial year  
2016 (i.e. from 01.01.2016 until 31.12.2016) The operating grant is not renewed in 2017. On 01.04.2016, 
entity A signs an H2020 action grant with one reporting period of 18 months (01.04.2016 – 31.12.2017). 
Beneficiary A may declare the indirect costs in the H2020 action grant as follows:  
 from 01.04.2016 to 31.12.2016 ONLY IF it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover 
any costs of the action (see beow);  
 from 01.01.2017 – 31.12.2017 under the normal H2020 rules (i.e 25% of the direct eligible costs 
since there is no operating grant covering the 2017 financial year).  
To demonstrate cost separation , the following conditions must be fulfilled:  
 the operating grant s may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it may not be f ull 
operating grant s)  
 the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting management with 
cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply these keys and codes to identify and 
separate the costs (i.e. to allocate  them to either the action grant  activities  or the operating grant  
activities )   
 the beneficiary must record:  
 all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating grant s (i.e. 
personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked to the WP) and  
 all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their action grant s (including the 
indirect costs linked to the action)  
 the allocation of the costs must  be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and realistic result.  
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions  must EITHER:  
 not sign/ terminate the operating grant s, in order to be able to claim  indirect costs  in the action 
grants  
 keep the operat ing grant s, but sign the action grant s without  indirect costs  or request no indirect 
costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre -filled amount in the indirect cost column of the financial 
statement) . 
The possibility to combine operating grants with action  grants if costs are separated was introduced with GA 
version 4.0. It applies also to older grant agreements, if the beneficiaries can demonstrate that there is no 
double funding, in accordance with the above -listed principles (analytical accounting tools,  full cost recording, 
fair allocation).  
Best practice:  In case of overlapping EU action and operating grant s, the beneficiary should immediately contact 
the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal ). Be aware that operating grants are not always easy to 
identify. They exist under various labels  (operating grants; financial contributions/support to the 
functioning/operation of entities; etc.). Check your call text.

1. Specific cost  categorie s (F.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility  conditions — 
Calculation  
This optional budget category  will be inserted into RIA, IA and CSA  GAs, if the action involves 
activities for which t he beneficiaries may declare specific unit /lump sum costs, i.e. currently :  
 actions under Part III  of Horizon 2020 , Societal Challenge 3 ‘Secure, clean and efficient 
energy’ involving energy efficiency measures  in buildings : costs for energy efficiency 
measures  in buildings  
This unit cost appl ies ONLY to Smart Cities and Communities calls (e.g. SCC-01-2014 for 
the Work Programme 2014 -2015)  and ONLY to the building -related demonstration 
activities.   
 actions under Part I, ‘ Research infrastructures ’: access costs for providing trans -
national or virtual access to research infrastructure  
The unit cost applies ONLY to actions with ‘provision of access activities’.  
Examples:  INFRAIA -1-2014-2015, INFRADEV -3-2015 and INFRADEV -4-2014-2015  
 actions under Part III, Societal Challenge 1 ‘Health, demographic change and wellbeing ’: 
costs for clinical studies  
The unit cost applies ONLY to actions with clinical studies.  
 Double funding risk — Costs that are declared as a specific unit or lump sum cost may NOT be declared ( a 
second time ) under another budget category (for the costs that are covered, see below) .  
Example:  The unit cost for efficiency energy measures in buildings covers subcontracting costs related to the 
energy efficiency measures. These cannot be declared as subcontracting  costs. By contrast, costs for subcontracts 
not included in the unit cost (e.g. subcontracts required by the implementation of the action but not related to the 
efficiency energy measures) can be declared.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  108 1.1 Specific  cost category  — costs for  energy efficiency measures  in buildings  (F.2)  
1.1.1  What?  This budget category covers  three  categories of direct and indirect costs:  
 costs of purchasing equipment, infrastructures and other assets directly necessary for 
additional energy efficiency measures in buildings  
 costs of subcontracting the works necessary for th ose measures  
 indirect costs for those measures.   
Examples:  the cost s of building elements (such as new insulation , new ventilation system, window, door, 
heating elements, control system ) and the man -days for install ing the building element s will be covered .  
What not?  Fluids .  
1.1.2  Costs of additional energy efficiency measures  must be declared  as the unit cost  set out in 
Commission Decision C(2013) 819626 and set out in Annex es 2 and 2a of the GA . 
The precise unit cost (‘amount per unit’ , i.e. EUR/m2 of eligible conditioned gross floor area)  is 
not pre -fixed by the Decision ; it must be calculated  for each beneficiary/linked third party — 
before signature of the GA  — using  the following table: 
Short name beneficiary/linked 
third party  BEST No  Amount per unit  Estimated No of 
units  Total unit cost 
(cost per unit x 
estimated no of 
units)  
     
     
     
 
The formula for calculating the ‘amount per unit’ ( EUR/m2 of eligible conditioned gross 
floor area ) is: 
Amount per unit =  {EUR 0 ,1 x estimated total kWh saved per m² per year x 10} 
Beneficiaries may however submit a proposal requesting funding for a number of kWh 
saved per m² per year lower  than the estimated one. But this will not be evaluated as an 
advantage against other proposals.  
The energy efficiency measures and the amount  per unit  must already be part of the proposal (see 
the proposal templates  and the BEST table  provided o n the call pages)  and be included in Annex es 
1 and 2a.  
The use of the unit cost is mandatory. The beneficiaries/linked third parties cannot choose 
between unit and actual costs.  
1.1.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation , etc.; see Article 6.1(b) ) 
 be incurred for energy efficiency measures in buildings that go beyon d the national 
regulation or, if there is no national regulation applicable, beyond the market practice (e.g. 
for refurbishment of buildings)

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  109 1.1.4 They must be calculated  as follows:  
amount per unit  (see Annex 2a  GA)  x  number of actual m2 of surface area built or refurbished 
(‘conditioned’)  
The ‘m2 of eligible conditioned gross floor area’ may NOT include parts of the buildings 
which are not affected by the measures, e.g. garages .  
 
Example for calculat ing unit costs for energy efficiency measures : 
Assuming that the refurbishment of a buildin g results in energy savings of 100 kWh/m²/year  
Payback period (standard figure to be used in the calculation) = 10 years  
Standard cost in euro to save 1 kWh (standard figure to be used in the calculation)= 0,1  EUR/kWh  
The formula gives:  
{standard cost in e uro to save 1 kWh * estimated total kWh saved per m² per year * standard payback period in 
years} =  
0,1 EUR/kWh * 100kWh/m²/year * 10 years= 100  EUR/m² 
After application of the 70% funding rate for innovation actions  (or for  non-profit beneficiaries/linked third parties : 
100%) , it will give an indicative EU contribution of 70  EUR/m² (or 100  EUR/m² if the funding rate is 100% ).  
 
1.2 Specific cost category — access c osts for providing trans -national  access to research 
infrastructure  (F.2)  
1.2.1  What?  This budget category covers  direct and  indirect access costs  for providing trans -
national access to research infrastructure  (i.e. the installation’s operating costs and costs related 
to logistical, techn ological and scientific support for users, including ad -hoc user training and the 
preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation) . 
 
What not?  Travel and subsistence costs for users to get access are not included in the access 
costs.  (These costs can be reimbursed separately, in category D.1 ‘travel ’; see Article 6.2.D.1  and 
Article 16 .) 
1.2.2  If they are declared under this budget category  (i.e. F.2  ‘access costs for providing trans -
national access to research infrastructure ’), the costs must be declared as the unit cost 
calculated  in accordance wit h Commission  Decision C(2013) 819927 and set out  in Annex 2 and 2a 
of the GA . 
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not pre -fixed by the 
Decision ; it must be calculated for each access provider and installation , using the calculation 
table provided on the call page  and the n summarised in the following table:

 This specific budget category must be distinguished from the general budget category D.4 
'capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure'  (see Article 6.2.D.4 ).  
Beneficiaries that use budget category F.2 ‘access costs for providing trans -national access to research 
infrastructure’ can NOT — under the same grant — declare costs under budget category D.4 ‘capitalised 
and operating costs of large research infrastruct ure’. 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  110         
        
 
The ‘unit of access ’ to the installation  must be identified  (i.e. the unit  used to measure the 
total quantity of access that the installation provides to its users )  
The formula for calculating the ‘amount per unit  of access ’ (EUR/unit of access ) is: 
Amount per unit  = average annual total access cost  (over past two years28) 
  average annual total quantity of access (over past two years29) 
The averages must be based on:  
 the beneficiary’s certified  or auditable historical data  
 costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices (including where the installation has been in operation for less than two years) 
and 
 a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of or der, under repair 
or undergoing long-term maintenance).  
Access providers  may however  submit a proposal with a unit cost calculated on the basis of 
average costs lower than their historical costs  (in Part B of their proposal) . 
The ‘total quantity of access’  means  all the units of access annually provided by the installation, 
included access financed under previous EU grant s, if any.  
The ‘annual total access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the following 
categories of eligible costs:  
 the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to 
the installation’, as recorded in th e certified or auditable profit -and-loss accounts of the 
reference period (years N -1 and N -2) for:  
 personnel cost s of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned 
to the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users   
 costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, 
calibrating and testing) specifically a warded for the functioning of the installation 
(if not capitalised)  
 costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the user’s research 
work 
 costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance 
costs, quality c ontrol and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality, 
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the 
functioning of the installation  
 costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation  
 costs of genera l services when they are specifically included in the provided 
access services (library costs, shipping costs , transport costs ) 
 costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data 
management and computing when they are need ed to provide access services  
 costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided or needed for 
the provision of access  
Costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices 
are acceptable for personnel (average personnel costs) and internally invoiced goods 
and services — if this is the normal practice of the beneficiary.  
 the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible 
direct costs, minus any costs of subcontract ing (i.e. costs of contracts for maintenance 
and repair , installation management , scientific services and other electronic services)  
AND excluding:  
                                            
28  In exceptional and duly justified cases, the Commission may agree to a different reference period.  
29  In exceptional and duly justified cases, the Commission may agree to a different reference period.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  111  all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including costs of 
renting or  leasing or d epreciation costs of buildings as well as depreciation and 
leasing of instrumentation) ; those costs are not eligible ; see also Article 6.2.D.2  
 travel and subsistence costs for users  
 ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.5 .  
Example (amount per unit ): 
Assuming that a telescope provided 6 100 hours of access in year N -1 and 5  900 hours of access in 
year N -2 and that the total access costs (for the provision of these total quantities of access) in the 
two years calculated on the basis of the categories of costs indicated above (with the exclusion of 
any contribution to capital investment and of travel and subsistence costs of users) is respectively 
EUR 3 200 000 and EUR 2 800  000, then th e unit cost is  
Average costs  = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) =  3 000 000  
Average hours = average (6  100, 5  900) = 6  000 
Unit cost = average (3 200 000, 2 800 000) / average (6  100, 5  900) =  3 000 000 /6  000 = 500 €  
The detailed calculation table s (one for each installation)  must already be part of the proposal  
(see proposal templates  and the calculation table  provided on the call pages) and be  included in 
Annex 1 ; the summary table must be included in Annex  2a.  
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe both the access services provided and the logistical, 
technological and scientific  support users need in order to make use of the installation  
(including ad -hoc training and preparatory and closing activities necessary  to use the 
installation ). 
 
As mentioned  above, before GA signature , the beneficiaries can still opt for declaring  the costs not 
as unit cost, but as actual costs under other budget categories (see Article 6.2.A -E). One cost 
form per installation.  
The use of unit costs for trans-national access activities is optional, i.e. each beneficiary/linked 
third party can decide independently whether to be reimbursed on the basis of unit costs , 
actual costs  or a combination of the two . 
Afterwards (once the GA  is sign ed), the choice  can be changed  only via an amendment (because it 
is necessary to determine the unit cost ; see Articles 4.2  and 55). 
1.2.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions  for costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred/used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(a) and 
(b)) 
 be incurred for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure to scientific 
communities  
 fulfil the additional cost eligibility  conditions  set out in Article 16 .1  
1.2.4 They must be calculated  as follows:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2a  GA)  x  number of actual units of access provided  
 
1.3 Specific  cost category — costs for clinical studies  (F.2)  
1.3.1  What? This budget category covers the following direct and indirect costs for ‘clinical 
studies’  (i.e. any clinical research involving a substantial amount of work related to the 
observation of, data collection from, or diagnostic or therapeutic intervention on multiple or 
individual patients ): 
 The Commission/Agency may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed calculation 
method (and correct them, if needed).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  112  direct p ersonnel costs of the doctors and other medical person nel and technical 
personnel (including data managers) that conduct ed the study  
 direct c osts of consumables used for the study  
 direct c osts of the medical equipment used for the study, including:  
 depreciation costs  
 costs of service contracts necessary for their functioning (including specific 
cleaning, maintenance and repair)  
 costs of other specific service contracts necessary for the study (including data 
analysis, if subcontracted)  
 indirect costs for the study . 
What not?  Travel and subsistence costs of study participants and horizontal tasks (e.g. study 
monitoring, study coordination)  are not covered by the clinical studies unit cost. (These costs can 
be reimbursed separately, e.g. in categories A. ‘personnel’, D .1 ‘travel’ and D.3 ‘other goods and 
services’ ; see Article s 6.2.A , 6.2.D.1 , 6.2.D.3 .) 
1.3.2  If they are declared under this budget category (i.e. F.2 ‘costs for clinical studies’ ), the 
costs must be declared  as the unit cost set out in Commission Decision C(201 6) 755330 and set 
out in Annex 2  and 2a of the GA.  
The precise unit cost (amount per unit , i.e. EUR/study participant ) is not pre -fixed by the 
Decisio n; it must be calculated for each study /study sequence  (see below)   and

 Where the nature of the clinical study allows it, it can be split into sequences, e.g. treatment cycles . 
The number of sequences should be limited to the necessary minimum (e.g. 3 sequences) . 
Separating the unit cost tab le into sequences will allow you to declare unit costs for study participants that 
dropped out during the study, but finalised the tasks of a sequence. Thus, the sequence unit cost can be 
charged for the participant, for the completed sequence(s).

Amount per unit (unit cost entire study):  XX EUR  XX EUR  XX EUR  XX EUR  XX EUR  
 
 
 
Each beneficiary /linked third party/third party must calculate its unit cost on the basis of  
its historical data (estimated costs of the components per task and study participant ). 
Historical cost reference data should be taken from the last closed financial year at the 
time of submission of the grant proposal ( certified or auditable profit and loss account for 
‘year N -1’).   
Beneficiaries  can choose whether to include all the cost components in their unit cost or 
only some , but they may NOT add any other cost categories . 
They may choose whether to include personnel costs or not, but if they do, all the 
study -related personnel costs must be included (they cannot choose for individual 
persons/types of personnel) . Moreover, t his choice must be applie d to all the tasks and 
sequences of the study. If personnel costs are included, t hey must moreover use one 
of the three available categories : doctors, other medical personnel  or technical 
personnel (no other categories, e.g. nurses must be included in ‘other medical 
personnel ’).  
For consumables, medical equipment and services, there is more flexibility. They can 
choose for each individual cost items, if they would like to include it in their unit cost 
(or declare them as actual costs ).  
The choice (whether to  include a cost component in the unit cost or not) is made by 
adding the costs into the table (or leaving it blank). All blank cost components are 
outside the unit cost (and can normally be declared as actual costs, if all the eligibility 
conditions  are me t). 
The beneficiaries/linked third parties/third parties may therefore (for the same 
study/sequence) not only obtain completely different amounts per unit, but also 
include different components into the ir calculation.  
Example:  
Beneficiary No 1 decided to claim:  
 personnel costs as unit costs  
 all consumables for sequence 1 as actual costs, all consumables in sequence 2 as unit cost 
and consumables in sequence 3 partially as actual , partially as unit costs  
 medical equipment partially as actual , partially as unit cost (e.g. cost of a standard MRI 
scan — part of the study protocol sequence 2 task 3 — as unit costs and the costs for 
the use of an novel imaging tool — also sequence 2 task 3 — as actual costs , for 
instance  because the historical data  is not fully available)  
 all services  as unit cost s.  
Beneficiary No 2 decided to claim all study costs as unit costs.  
Linked third party 2a decided not to use the unit cost for any of the study costs (all costs as actual 
costs).

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  116 For indirect costs : 
{{{cost component ‘personnel costs’ +  cost component  ‘consumables’ + cost component ‘medical  
equipment’}  
minus  
{costs of in -kind contributions provided by third parties which are not used on the beneficiary’s 
premises  + costs of providing financial support to third parties (if any) }} 
multiplied by  
25%} 
The estimation of the resources to be used must be done on the basis of the study protocol and must 
be the same for all beneficiaries/linked third parties/third parties involved.  
The year N -1 to be used is the last closed financial year at the time of submission of the grant 
application.  
This table  must already be part of the proposal (see the  proposal  templates  and the  template for 
essential information to be provided for proposals including clinical  studies  provided on t he call 
pages ) and be included in Annex 1 and 2a of the GA.  
 
As mentioned  above, before  GA signature, the beneficiaries can still opt for declaring the costs  
components not as u nit cost, but as actual costs  under other  budget categories  (see Article 6.2.A -
E).  
The use of unit costs for clinical studies is optional, i.e. each beneficiary/linked third party can 
decide independently (and for the different cost components/cost items) whether to be 
reimbursed on the basis of unit costs or of costs actually incurred .  
Afterwards (o nce the GA is signed ), the choice can be changed only via an amendment (because it 
is necessary to determine the unit cost ; see Articles 4.2  and 55). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions :  
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 6.1(b) )  
 be incurred for carrying out clinical studies . 
1.3.4 They must be calculated as follows:  
 amount per unit (see Annex 2a  GA)  x  the number of study participants  
 
 
 
 The Commission/Agency may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed calculation 
method (and correct them, if needed).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amendment requests to change the unit cost calculation will be accepted ONLY if there was a change 
in the study protocol (e.g. due to requests from competent authorities, regulatory agencies or ethics 
committees)  or if there was an error in the calculation.  
 The maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1 ) will NOT be increased.  
 In case of an amendment, it is still  the historical costs of the last closed financial year at the time of 
submission of the grant proposal  that must be used to re -calculate the unit cost .

H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  117 1.4 Specific cost category — access costs for providing virtual  access to research 
infrastructure (F.2)  
1.2.1  What?  This budget category covers  direct and indirect  costs for providing virtual  access to 
research infrastructure  (i.e. the installation’s operatin g costs and costs related to logistical, 
technological and scientific support for users , including costs for preparatory and closing activities  
that may be necessary to provide the requested access  services ). 
 
What not? Contributions to the capital investment of the infrastructure (including rental, lease or 
depreciation costs of buildings, as well as depreciation and lease of instrumentation) , unless 
otherwise specificed in the work programme /call. In the latter ca se, only the portion used to 
provide virtual access under the action can be eligible.  
1.2.2  If they are declared under this budget category (i.e. F.2  ‘ access costs for providing virtual  
access to research infrastructure’) , the costs must be declared as  the unit cost calculated in 
accordance with Decision of 6 February 201931 and set out in Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
The precise unit cost (amount per unit, i.e. EUR/unit of access) is not pre -fixed by the 
Decision; it must be calculated for each access provider and installation, using the calculation 
table provided on the call page and then summarised in the following table:  
Short name 
access 
provider  Short 
name 
infrastruc
ture  Installation  Unit of 
access  Amount 
per unit  Estimated 
No of unit s Total unit 
cost  
(cost per unit x 
estimated no of 
units)  No  Short name  
        
        
        
 
The ‘unit of access’ to the installation must be identified (i.e. the unit used to measure the 
total quantity of access that the installation provides to its users)   
The formula for calculating the ‘amount per unit  of access’ (EUR/unit of access ) is: 
Amount per unit  = total virtual access costs to the installation over last year 
  total quantity of virtual access to the installation provided over the last  year 
The total virtual access costs must be based on:  
 the beneficiary’s certified  or auditable historical data  
 costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices , and 
 excluding periods  when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair or 
undergoing long -term maintenance).  
Access providers may however submit a proposal with a unit cost lower than the one 
calculated on the basis of their historical costs  (in Part B of their proposal ).

access_infra.pdf  
 This specific budget category must be distinguished from the general budget category D.4 
'capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure'  (see Article 6.2.D.4 ).  
Benefi ciaries that use budget category F.2 ‘access costs for providing virtual  access to research 
infrastructure’ can NOT — under the same grant — declare costs under budget category D.4 ‘capitalised 
and operating costs of large research infrastructure’.  

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.E  118 The ‘total quantity of access’ means all the units of access annually provided by the installation, 
included access financed  under previous EU grant s, if any.  
The ‘ total virtual  access costs to the installation’ is calculated on the basis of the followin g 
categories of eligible costs:  
 the direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘  total quantity of virtual access to 
the installation provided over the last  year’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit -
and-loss ac counts of the referenc e period (year N -1) for: 
 personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned 
to the functioning of the installation and to the support of the users  
 costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning,  
calibrating and testing) specifically awarded for the functioning of the installation 
(if not capitalised)  
 costs of consumables specifically used for the installation  
 costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance 
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality, 
safety or security standards (if not capitalised) specifically incurred for the 
functioning of the installation  
 costs of energy power and water specifically supplied for the ins tallation  
 costs of software licence, internet connection or other electronic services for data 
management and computing supplied specifically f or the installation when they 
are needed to provide virtual access services  
 costs of specific scientific services  included in the access provided or needed for 
the provision of virtual access  by the installation.  
Costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices 
are acceptable for personnel (average personnel costs) and internally invoiced goods 
and services — if this is the normal practice of the beneficiary.  
 the indirect costs for providing access to the installation, equal to 25% of the eligible direct 
costs, minus any costs of subcontracting (i.e. costs of contracts for maintena nce and 
repair, installation management, scientific services and other electronic services)  
AND excluding:  
 all contributions to the capital investments of the installation (including costs of 
renting or leasing or depreciation costs of buildings as well as  depreciation and 
leasing of instrumentation ) unless otherwise specificed in the Work Programme.  
 ineligible costs as referred to in Article 6.5 . 
The detailed calculation tables (one for each installation) must already be part of the proposal (see 
proposal templates  and the calculation table  provided on the call pages) and be included in Annex 
1; the summary table must be included in Annex 2a.  
The proposal and Annex 1 should describe both the access services provided and the logistical, 
technological and scientific  support need ed to enable  the virtual use of the installation  by 
users, as well as any conditions that users must meet to have virtual access to the installation . 
 
As mentioned above, before  GA signature, the beneficiaries can still opt for declaring the costs not 
as unit cost, but as actual costs un der other budget categories (see Article 6.2.A -E). One cost 
form per installation.  
The use of unit costs for virtual  access activities is optional, i.e. each virtual acess provider 
(beneficiary/third party ) can decide independently whether to be reimbursed on the basis of 
unit costs, actual costs or a combination of the two.  
Afterwards (once the GA is signed), the choice can be changed only via an amendment (because it 
is necessary to  determine the unit cost;  see Articles 4.2  and 55). 
 
 The Commission/Agency may verify that the proposed unit costs comply with the prescribed calculation 
method (and correct them, if needed).

1. Costs of linked third  parties (A-F) 
This option (together with the corresponding Article 14  and other provisions) will be inserted into 
the GA if the action is implemented with linked third parties.  
 
The costs of linked third parties are eligible , if: 
 they fulfil  — mutatis mutandis  — the general conditions  and specific conditions  for 
costs to be eligible (see Article 6.1  and 6.2) and 
 they fulfil the additional cost eligibility  condition s set out in Article 14 .1.1. 
Depending on the type of cost, they must be declared  by the linked third party under the  
corresponding  budget category (as the beneficiary would  use for its own cost s). 
Example s:  
1. Remuneration  of employees  must be declared in category A.1  ‘personnel costs ’ (Article 6.2.A.1 ). 
2. Depreciation costs of equipment m ust be declared in category D.2 ‘ equipment’ ( Article 6.2.D.2 ). 6.3 Conditions for costs of linked third parties  to be eligible   
[OPTION 1 to be used if Article 14 applies:  Costs incurred by linked third parties are eligible  if they fulfil 
— mutatis mutandis  — the general and specific conditions for eligibility set out in this Article (Article 6.1 
and 6.2) and Article 14 .1.1.]  
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ] 
 Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to fully participate in the action , like the 
beneficiary they are linked to . The y will therefore be treated f or many issues (including cost eligibility) 
like beneficiaries . 
The same rules apply , but with the  changes needed to render them applicable to linked third parties.  
Examples:  
1. ‘Incurred by the beneficiary’ should be read as ‘incurred by th e linked third party’.  
2. ‘On the beneficiary’s payroll’ should  be read as ‘on the linked third party’s payroll’.

1. In-kind contributions  by third parties free of charge (A-F) 
Contributions provided by third parties free of charge  are eligible  if: 
 they fulfil — mutatis mutandis  — the general conditions  and specific conditions  for 
costs to be eligible (see Article 6.1  and 6.2) and 
 they fulfil the  additional cost eligibility conditions  set out in Article 12.1. 
Depending on the type of cost, they must be declared  (by the beneficiary/linked third party) 
under the budget category the y would use for their own cost s. 
Example: Depreciation costs of equipment contributed free of charge must  be declared in category  D.2 
‘equipment’ ( Article 6.2.D.2 ). 
  In-kind contributions free of charge  must be distinguished from in-kind contributions against 
payment  (see Article 11 ). 
In-kind contributions against payment  are costs of the beneficiary (because they have to pay) and are 
therefore already explicitly mentioned in the different budget categories (see Article 6.2.A.3 , 6.2.D.2, 
6.2.D.3 ). Their costs (i.e. the payment) must be declared under those specific budget categories.  
Example s:  
1. The cost of personnel seconded against payment must be declared in category A.3  ‘seconded personnel 
(against payment )’ (Article 6.2.A.3).  
2. Costs of equipment contributed against payment must be declared in category D.2 ‘equipment’ (Article 
6.2.D.2).  
The costs of in -kind contributions free of charge (i.e. the costs of the third party offering them) can be 
assimilated to beneficiary costs and must be declared in the budget category that the beneficiary would 
have used.  
 
 
 
 
 
 6.4 Conditions for in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge  to be eligible  
In-kind contributions provided free of charge  are eligible  direct costs (for the beneficiary [or linked third 
party]), if the costs incurred by the third party fulfil — mutatis mutandis  — the general and specific 
conditions for eligibility  set out in this Article (Article 6.1 and 6.2)  and Article 12.1.

1. Ineligible costs  
Costs are ineligible , if one of the following applies:  
 they do not meet the general and specific eligibility c onditions  set out in Article s 6.1 
to 6.4 
Examples:  additional remuneration (‘bonuses’) paid by for -profit or non -profit entities do not fulfil the 
conditions set out in Article 6.2;  subcontracting costs do not comply with Article 13  
 they are listed in Article 6.5 , in particular :  
 costs related to  return on capital or return  generated by an investment  
Examples:  dividends paid as remunerat ion for investing in the action; r emuneration paid as a 
share in the company’s equity.  6.5 Ineligible costs  
‘Ineligible costs ’ are:  
 (a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (Article 6.1 to 6.4), in particular:  
(i) costs related to return on capital;  
(ii) debt and debt service charges;  
(iii) provisions for future losses or debts;  
(iv) interest owed;  
(v) doubtful debts;  
(vi) currency exchang e losses;  
(vii) bank costs charged by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the [Commission] [Agency] ;  
(viii) excessive or reckless expenditure;  
(ix) deductible VAT;  
(x) costs incurred during suspension of the implementation of the action (see Article 49 ); 
(b) costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State and 
financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the 
[Commission] [Agency]  for the purpose of implementing the EU or  Euratom budget); in particular, 
indirect costs if the beneficiary is already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom 
budget in the same period, unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs 
of the action [; ][.] 
[(c) OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme: [insert name of excluded 
cost category ]].  
6.6 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42 ).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.5  123  debt and debt service charges   
‘Debt service ’ is the  amount paid on a loan in principal  and interest, over a period of 
time. 
Example:  If a beneficiary takes a loan used to acquire equipment or consumables for the 
project of EUR 100 000 at 9 percent interest for 10 years, the debt service for the first year 
(principal and interest) is EUR 15 582  
 provisions for future losses or debts   
‘Provision’ means  an amount  set aside in an organisation’s accounts , to cover for a 
known liability of uncertain timing or amount. This  includes allowances for doubtful 
or bad debts.  
 interest owed  (i.e. i nterest on a loan to borrow capital ) 
 excessive or reckless  expenditure  
‘Excessive ’ means  paying significantly more for products, services or personnel than 
the prevailing market rates or the usu al practices of the beneficiary  (and thus 
resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action ).  
‘Reckless ’ means failing to exercise care in the selection of products, services or 
personnel (and thus resulting in an avoidable financial loss to the action ). 
 currency exchange losses  (i.e. for beneficiaries using currencies other than euros 
or being invoiced in a  currency other than the currency they use : any loss due to 
exchange rate fluctuations (e.g. between the date of invoicing and the date of 
payment) ) 
 bank costs charged  by the beneficiary’s bank for transfers from the 
Commission/Agency .  
Conversely , bank ch arges for the distribution of the EU funding may constitute an 
eligible cost for the coordinator (if the eligibility conditions  of Article 6.1  and Article 
6.2.D.3  are met ). 
 deductible VAT  
‘Deductible  VAT’ means VAT that is recoverable under the national ‘VAT system ’ (i.e. 
the system of collection and deduction under the national VAT legislation) . Such VAT 
is not a genuine and definitive cost and, according to accounting standards, should 
not be recorded as such. Therefore, it is not actually incurred by the beneficiary.  
The cost and revenue accounts should exclude deductible VAT; such VAT should be 
recorded in separate payable or receivable accounts, without effect  on revenue or 
cost line items.  
The VAT  paid is a claim against the tax authority . It should be  recorded in the 
‘assets’ part of the balance sheet. It should not be recorded as expenditure in 
the profit and loss accounts (only the purchase price of goods and services 
excluding  VAT should be recorded). Similarly, for the value of purchased 
equipment or assets, only the net purchase cost should be recorded in the 
balance sheet’s fixed asset line, and the depreciation cost should be calculated 
based on this value , excluding VAT.  
The VAT collected  is a debt towards the tax authority and should therefore be  
recorded in the ‘liabilities’ part of the balance sheet.  
Conversely, if VAT is NOT deductible , it is an eligible cost.   
The full price of the goods or services b ought by the beneficiary can be  
recorded as expenditure in its profit and loss accounts, without any distinction 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 3 > Article 6.5  124 between the net price and the amount of VAT charged on it. The full price of 
equipment and assets bought can be  recorded in the balance sheet’s fixed asset 
line and is the basis for the depreciation allowances recorded in the profit and 
loss accounts.  
 costs incurred during the suspension of the implementation of the action  
Example:  Action is suspended and one of the beneficiaries continues working on it after the 
date of the suspension  
 costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant  (i.e. double funding ) 
This includes:  
 costs funded directly by EU programmes managed by the Commission or 
Executive Agencies (e.g. ot her H2020 grants)  
 costs managed/funded/awarded by Member States but co -funded with 
EU/Euratom funds (e.g. European Structural and Investment Funds  (ESIF) ) 
 costs for grants awarded/funded/managed by other EU, international or 
national bodies and co -funded with EU/Euratom funds (e.g. Joint 
Undertakings, Article 18 5 TFEU bodies ) 
 if a beneficiary is receiving an operating grant32 from the EU/Euratom, then 
the ind irect costs of that beneficiary are not eligible and the 25% flat -rate 
should not be applied  — unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant 
does not cover any costs of the action (see Article 6.2.E ). 
Examples (operati ng grants):  Grants awarded to support the running costs of 
certain institutions pursuing an aim of European interest, such as: College of Europe, 
European standards bodies (CEN, CENELEC, ETSI).  
 cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme /call  (if option 
applies) . 
If a beneficiary declares ineligible costs , they will be rejected and, if needed, other measures 
specified in Chapter 6 (e.g. suspension, termination, grant reduction, etc.)  may be taken.  
 
Specific cases (ineligible costs):  
Non-identifiable VAT  (in foreign invoices ) — In exceptional cases where the beneficiary cannot 
identify the VAT charged by the supplier (e.g. small non -EU invoices) , the full purchase price can be 
recorded in the accounts  if it is not possible to deduct the VAT. That VAT would therefore be eligible.  
Partially deductible VAT — Some entities have a mixed VAT regime, meaning that they carry out VAT 
exempt or out -of-the-scope activities AND VAT taxed activities. When VAT paid on goods or services by 
these entities cannot be directly allocated to one or the other category of activities it will be  partially  
deductible. Therefore it will also be partially  eligible. The eligible part corresponds to the pro -rata of the 
VAT which is not deductible for that entity.  
In these cases, the beneficiary uses a provisional (estimated) deduction ratio during the year. The final 
ratio is only determined at the end of the fiscal year. The beneficiary must regularise VAT when closing 
its accounts. Therefore, the beneficiary must  also regularize the VAT costs declared for the grant (by 
declaring, in the next reporting period, an adjustment for the difference between the provisional 
deduction ratio and the final ratio).  
Duties  — The eligibility of dut ies depend s on the eligibility of the cost item to which they are linked 
(i.e. in whose price they are include d). If the item is eligible, the duty is also eligible.  
                                            
32  For the definition,  see Article 121(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation  No 966/2012 : ‘operating grant ’ means 
direct financial contribution, by way of donation, from the budget in order to finance the functioning of a body 
which pursues an aim of gen eral EU interest or has an objective forming part of and supporting an EU policy.

1. Proper implement ation of  the action  
The beneficiaries must properly implement the action. This general obligation is twofold, i.e. they 
must: 
 carry out the action  (and especially the research work) as detailed in Annex 1 (‘technical 
implementation’)  
The beneficiaries must prevent delays in implementing the action, or reduce them as much 
as possible. In addition, they must immediately inform the Commission/Ag ency (see 
Article  17). 
AND 
 comply with all the other provisions of the GA and all the applicable provisions of EU, 
international and national law.  
Example:  Each beneficiary must comply in particular with the labour law applicable to the personnel 
working on the action and must fulfil the tax and social obligations related to the activities it carries out 
under the applicable  national law.  
 
 
 CHAPTER 4 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES  
SECTION 1 RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO IMPLEMENTING THE ACTION  
ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  
7.1  General obligation to properly implement the action  
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions 
of the Agreement and all legal obligations under applicable EU,  international and national law.  
7.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may  be reduced (see  Article 43 ).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
  Normally, the beneficiaries must comply BOTH  with the national law of the country in which they are 
established  AND that of the country where the action  is implemented .  
 
 
.

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources  — Third 
parties involve d in the action  
The beneficiaries must normally  have the technical and financial resources  needed to carry out 
the action themselves . 
The resources must be available at the moment of the implementation of the work  (but not 
necessarily at the mom ent of submitting the proposal or signing the GA). However, in these last 
two cases, the beneficiaries must show in the proposal how the resources will be made available 
when they are needed.  
Example s (acceptable):   
1. Start-up company with no resources at  the time of proposal submission, but with a credible business plan 
described in the application.  
2. SME which, if successful, intends to double its capacity/staff.  
Example (not acceptable):  Consultancy company which submits a proposal where the majority o f the work is 
subcontracted.  
As an exception, beneficiaries may purchase goods, works or services (see Article 10 ), use in -kind 
contributions provided by third parties (see Articles 11  and 12) or call upon subcontractors or 
linked third parties to carry out work under the action (see Articles 13  and 14) and declare these 
costs for the action . They may also call on international partners to carry out work under the 
action without receiving EU funding  (see Article 14a ) (third part ies involve d in the action ).  
Suppliers of goods, works or services  and third parties providing in-kind contri butions (against 
payment or free of charge) do not implement action tasks  themselves , but only make resources 
available  to the beneficiary , whereas subcontractors , linked third parties and international partners 
implement action tasks . 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION – THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources  to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see  Article 10 );  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see  Article 11 ); 
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see  Article 12 );  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see  Article 13 ); 
- call upon li nked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14 ); 
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a ). 
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission] [Agency]  and the other 
beneficiaries for implementing the action.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  127  
 
 
Third part ies involved in the action do  NOT sign the GA (see Article 1 ).  
The differences  between subcontracts (Article 13 ) and other contracts for purchase of goods, 
works or services (Article 10 ) are: 
Article 10  
Contracts to purchase goods, works or services  Article 13   
Subcontracts  
These contracts do not cover the implementation of 
action tasks, but they are necessary to implement 
action tasks by beneficiaries.  Subcontracts concern the implementation of 
action tasks; they imply the implementation of 
specific tasks which are part of the action and 
are described in Annex 1.  
Do not have to be indicated in Annex 1.  Must be indicated in Annex 1.  
The price for these contracts will be declared as 
‘other direct costs’ — column D in Annex 2 — in the 
financial statement; they will be taken into account 
for the application of the flat -rate for indirect costs.  The price for the subcontracts will be decla red 
as ‘direct costs of subcontracting’ — column B 
in Annex 2 — in the financial statement; they 
will not be taken into account for the 
application of the flat -rate for indirect costs.  
 
Example (contracts): Contract for a  computer; contract for an audit certificate on the financial 
statements; contract for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract 
for the creation of a website that enables action’s beneficiaries to work together ( if creating the website is 
not an action task) ; contract for organis ation of the rooms and catering for a meeting (if the organi sation 
of the meeting is not an action task mentioned as such in Annex 1); contract for hiring IPR 
consultants/agents.  
Example (subcontracts):  Contract for  (parts of) the research or innovation tasks mentioned in  
Annex 1.  
The differences between subcontractors (Article 13 ) and contractors (Article 10 ) on one side and 
linked third parties (Article 14 ) on the other are:  
Articles 10 & 13  
Contracts and subcontracts  Article 14  
Implementation by linked third parties  
The beneficiaries have a contractual link with 
contractors or subcontractors having as their 
object the purchase goods, works or services or 
the implementation of specific action tasks.  The beneficiaries have a legal link with the linked 
third parties not limited to the action and not 
based on a contract for the purchase goods, works 
or services or the implementation  of specific action 
tasks.  
They must fulfil the same conditions for 
participation and funding under H2020 as 
beneficiaries (for instance, be established in an EU 
Member State, H2020 associated country or third 
country  listed in General Annex A to the H2020  
Work Programme ). 
 
 
 
  Beneficiaries using third parties remain fully responsible  for the m under the GA.  
 Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to fully participate in the action , like the  
beneficiary they are linked to . They will therefore be treated f or many issues like beneficiaries .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  128 The eligible costs are the prices charged to the 
beneficiary by the contractors or subcontractors 
(usually containing a profit margin for the 
contractors or subcontractors but not for the 
beneficiary).  The eligible costs are o nly the costs of the linked 
third party, no profit is allowed (neither for the 
linked third party nor for the beneficiary).  
The beneficiary must award the contracts and 
subcontracts on the basis of best value  for 
money (or lowest price) and absence of con flict 
of interests.  The linked third parties have to be affiliates to a 
beneficiary or must have a legal link (as explained 
in Article 14) with the beneficiary.  
 
Example (implementation by linked third party):  Company X and company Y do not control each 
other, but they are both fully owned by company Z. Company X is beneficiary in the grant and company Y 
implements some of the action tasks described in Annex 1( Testing and analysis of the resistance of a new 
component under high temperatures).  
The differences between contracts (Article 10 ) and in -kind contributions against payment  
(Article 11 ) are: 
Article 10  
Contracts  Article 11  
In-kind contributions against payment  
Contractors act as economic operators selling to 
the beneficiary goods, works or services that are 
necessary for the action.  Third parties contributing in -kind make available 
some of their resources to a beneficiary without 
this being their economic activity ( i.e. seconding 
personnel, contributing equipment,  infrastructure 
or other assets, or other goods and services ). 
The eligible costs are the prices charged to the 
beneficiary by the contractors or subcontractors 
(usually containing a profit margin  for the 
contractors or subcontractors but not for the 
beneficiary).  The eligible costs are the amounts that the 
beneficiary pays to the contributors according to 
their agreements, within the limit of the third 
party’s costs (the amounts to be paid to the 
contributors usually exclude a profit margin but if 
they do, the profit margin is not eligible).  
 
Example (in -kind contribution against payment):  Civil servant working as a professor in a public 
university. His salary is paid by the government (the m inistry) which employs him. According to the 
secondment agreement, the beneficiary (the un iversity) has to reimburse the g overnment an amount 
corresponding to the paid salary. The reimbursed amount is a cost for the beneficiary and is recorded as 
such in i ts accounts. The beneficiary will declar e the amount reimbursed to the g overnment in its financial 
statements.  
Example (in -kind contribution free of charge): Civil servant working as a professor in a public 
university. His salary is paid not by the benefic iary (the university) but by the g overnment (the ministry). 
According to  the secondment agreement, the g overnment does not ask any reimbursement in exchange 
(non-cash donation). The beneficiary will declare these salary costs in its financial statements, e ven if they 
are paid by a third party (the m inistry/ government).  
 
Specific cases (third parties involved in the action):  
Authorisation to administer  — Coordinators that are s econdary or higher education establishments 
and coordinators that are public  bodies may exceptionally delegate the administration of the payments  
to another legal entity (third party ), in most cases a foundation . 
The third party must fulfil the following conditions:  
 it must  have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’  by the  coordinator   
AND 
 it must be  affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
affairs, including receiving and administering EU funds.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  129  
 
 
 
In this case, t he option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisation s to administer must be added to the grant 
agreement.  The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8  must be that of the entity and 
the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must therefore be regis tered in the Participant 
Register  and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will  get its own PIC — although it is not a 
beneficia ry. 
The costs of the entity may be declared by the coordinator as in -kind contributions (free of charge or 
against payment; see Articles 6 , 11 and 12).  
 Project management  — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer  remain fully responsible  for it under 
the GA.

1. Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding   
This optional Article will be inserted into the GA if the action is implemented with beneficiaries that 
do not receiv e EU funding.  
 
 
 
‘Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding ’ are either:  
 ‘beneficiaries  not eligible for funding ’, i.e. beneficiaries which :  
 are NOT from an EU Member State, H2020 associated country or third country 
listed  in General Annex A to the H2020  Work Programme  AND 
 were NOT granted exceptional EU funding by the Commission/Agency (during the 
selection procedure ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ‘beneficiaries request ing zero funding ’, i.e. beneficiaries  that are eligible for funding , but 
decided  not to request any fund ing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Their tasks will appear in Annex 1 and their estimated costs (although not eligible) in Annex 2.  
 For more information  on third country participants , see the  Funding & Tenders Portal 
Online Manual  (international cooperation) . Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 that are applicable to it .]  
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ] 
 
  Beneficiaries requesting zero funding may in principle request  funding later on, if the GA is 
amend ed  (to change Article 9 and Annex 2; see Article 55 ). 
Since  the maximum grant amount  will NOT be increased (see Article 5.1 ), this would only be possible 
if the consortium reshuffle s the estimated budget in order to free funding for the beneficiary 
concerned.  
Moreover, c osts incurred before the amendment would be eligible ONLY if they comply with all the 
obligations under the GA retroactively (e.g. for actual personnel costs  must be supported by time 
records in accordance with Article 18 ). 
 
 
 
 
. 
 
 Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding — They participate in the action as beneficiaries, but NOT with 
EU fundin g. They must carry out the work under the action and comply with the GA (although not with all its 
obligations; the financial obligations and some IPR obligations do not apply for them).   
 
 
  Beneficiaries that (exceptionally) become eligible for funding during the action, may in principle 
request funding (as from their eligibility), if the grant agreement is amended to change Articles 9, 57 
and Annex 2 ( see Article 55 ).   
Since the maximum grant amount  will NOT  be increased (see Article 5.1 ), this would only be possible 
if the consortium reshuffles the estimated budget in order to free funding for the beneficiary 
concerned.  
Moreover, costs incurred before the amendment would be eligible ONLY as from the date of eligibility 
for funding and if they comply with all the obligations under the GA (e.g. for actual personnel costs  
must be supported by time rec ords in accordance with Article 18 ).

* with the possible exception of additional exploitation obligations, which is a suboption to be activated where applicableDo not apply only for results

Apart from this, they are treated like the other beneficiaries.  
The other obligations apply, just like for normal beneficiaries (e.g. provide requested 
information and allow technical checks, reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the 
action’s impact; maintain confidentiality; comply with security -related obligations; promote 
the action and give visibility to the EU funding).  
In case of breach of any of their obligations , their participation may be terminated and any 
of the other Chapter 6 measu res (except for rejection of costs  or recovery) may be taken . 
Example s:  
1. A beneficiary not receiv ing EU funding does not carry out the tasks attributed to it in Annex 1. At the end 
of the action, only part of the action is implemented  the Commission may, at the payment of the 
balance, if the action tasks were not properly implemented, reduce the grant awarded in accordance with 
Article 43 .  
2. In addition, the beneficiary has breached fundamental ethical principles  it may be excluded from all 
contracts or grants financed by the EU or Euratom for a maximum period of five years (see Article 45 ). 
Best practice:  The Co mmission/Agency will assess the consequences of breach of obligations or 
improper implementation by beneficiaries not receiving EU funding at action level (not at beneficiary 
level). Therefore, beneficiaries are advised to foresee this situation — before signature of the GA — 
in the consortium agreement .

1. Purchase of goods, works or services  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may purchase goods, works or services.  
 
 
 
 
 
  Purchase s — For the purposes of the GA, ‘ purchas e contract ’ means ordinary contract for services, 
works (i.e. buildings)  or goods (e.g. equipment) , needed to carry out the action, including the purchase of 
consumables and supplies.  
Example (contracts):  Contract for a computer; contract for an audit certificate on the financial statements; 
contract for the translation of documents; contract for the publication of brochures; contract for the creation 
of a website that ena bles an action’s beneficiaries to work together (if creating the website is not an action 
task); contract for logistic support (e.g. organisation of the rooms, catering) for organising a meeting (if this 
is not an action tasks described as such in Annex 1) ; contract for hiring IPR consultants/agents.  
 ARTICLE 10 — PURCHASE OF GOODS, WORKS OR SERVICES  
10.1 Rules for purchasing goods, works or services  
10.1.1 If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may purchase goods, works or services .  
The beneficiaries must make such purchases ensuring the best value for money or , if appropriate, the  
lowest price . In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see  Article 35 ).  
[OPTION:  In addition, if the value of the purchase exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must comply with 
the following rules: […]23] 
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights  under Articles 22 and 23 also 
towards their contractors.  
10.1.2  Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ within the meaning of D irective 2004/18/EC24 (or 
2014/24/EU)25  or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC26 (or 2014/25/EU)27  
must comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.  
10.2  Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 10.1.1, the costs related to the contract 
concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see  Article 42). 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 10.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .  
 
23 If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality, t aking into 
account the value of the contracts and the relat ive size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. 
Specific rules must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable 
provisions should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR  60 000. The 
authorising officer may set a threshold higher than EUR 60 000 on the basis of a risk assessment.

Characteristics of purchase contracts:  
 They are usually limited in cost and scope.  
 
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Best value  for money or lowest price  
The beneficiaries must base their p urchase s either on th e best value  for money (considering the 
quality of the service, good or work proposed , i.e. the  best price -quality ratio ) or on the lowest 
price.  
This requirement reflects the general cost eligibili ty condition  set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)  
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial 
management)  and applies it specifically to  the purchasing context.  
The best value for money principle does NOT in all cases require competitive selection 
procedures . However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must demonstrate how 
best value for money was ensured.  
For the best price -quality ratio, price i s an essential aspect  (together with quality criteria, such 
as technical quality, etc. ), but i t is NOT automatically necessary to select the offer with the 
lowest price . Selecting the lowest price may however be appropriate for automatic award 
procedures w here the contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and 
quotes the lowest price.  
Example:  electronic tendering for consumables  
In order to provide a good analysis of the price -quality ratio, the criteria defining quality 
must be clear and  coherent with the purposes of the purchase.  
Occasionally (and only for contracts with a value higher than EUR 60 000) the Commission/Agency 
may set out additional conditions  (in view of the possible financial risks, taking into account the 
size of the con tract and the grant amount ). These conditions must be described in the work 
programme/call — as special eligibility conditions for the purchase costs — and be based on the 
rules which the European  Commission applies for its own procurement contracts.  
Examples (additional conditions):  minimum number of offers received; publication in the Official Journal or 
in specific media such as internet, national newspapers, etc.  
 
3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the contractor (by the 
Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits  and 
investigations on the contractor (see Article 22 ). 
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
impact of the action under Article 23 .  
It is the beneficiaries’ re sponsibility to ensure that these  obligation s are accepted by the 
contractor (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the 
eligibility of the costs, it will reject them).  
  Article 10 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 10.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 10.1.2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 The differences between purchase contracts, subcontracts, in -kind contributions against payment and 
implementation by linked third parties  are explained in Article 8 .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Arti cle 10  136 4. ‘Other obligation ’: Compliance with national procurement rules  
Beneficiar ies that are ‘contracting authorit ies’ or ‘contracting entit ies’ (within the meaning of  the 
EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU34 must moreover  comply with the 
applicabl e national law on public procurement . These rules normally provide for special 
procurement procedures , for the types of contracts they cover.  
‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by 
public law, associatio ns formed by one or several of such authorities or one or several of such 
bodies governed by public law (see Article 2.1(1) of Directive 20 14/24/EU). 
‘Bodies governed by public law’ also include entities financed mostly by the State, 
regional or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law and entities 
controlled by those bodies ( for the full definition, see Article 2.1(4) of that Directive ). 
‘Contracting entities’ means entities operating in a utilities se ctor (water, energy, transport, 
postal services). They may be contracting authorities, public undertakings or entities 
operating on the basis of special or exclusive rights (for the full definition, see Article 4 of 
Directive  2014/25/EU). 
 
Specific cases (purchases):  
Purchases between beneficiaries  — Are in principle not accepted . If a beneficiary needs suppl ies 
from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them  to the action. (Otherwise 
there is the risk  that the grant is used to charge commercial profit mar gins.) Purchases between 
beneficiaries will only be accepted in exceptional and properly justified cases (e.g. beneficiary A is the 
usual supplier of beneficiary B for a generic consumable that beneficiary B needs for the action) .  
Framework contracts or subcontracts  — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if 
this is the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of goods). In order to be eligible, the 
framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best -value -for-money and absence of 
conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily have to be concluded before the start 
of the action.

AGAINST PAYMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. In-kind contributions by third parties against payment  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in -kind contributions provided by 
third parties against payment.  
A ‘third party’ can be any legal entity that has not signed the GA (see Article 1 ).  
This Article refers to in -kind contributions ( i.e. non -financial resources of third parties put at 
the beneficiaries’ disposal ) that beneficiaries receive against pa yment . In this case, the 
beneficiary makes a payment and therefore incurs a cost.  
Example  (in-kind contributions against payment) : medical equipment provided by a hospital 
(against a fee) to a university in order to carry out research  
Both this Article and Article 12  only refer to in -kind contributions; they do NOT concern the 
case of linked third parties carrying out part of the action tasks  described in Annex 1 (see 
Article 14 ). 
 
 
 
  Article 11 contains additional cost eligibility conditions.  
 
. 
 
 
 ARTICLE 11 — USE OF IN -KIND CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES 
AGAINST PAYMENT  
11.1  Rules for the use of in -kind contributions against payment  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions  provided by third 
parties against payment . 
The beneficiaries may declare costs related to the payment  of in -kind contributions as eligible (see  
Article 6.1  and 6.2), up to the third parties’ costs  for the seconded persons, contributed equipment, 
infrastructure or other assets or other contributed goods and services.  
The third parties and their contributions  must be  set out in Annex 1 . The [Commission] [Agency]  may 
however approve  in-kind contributio ns not set out in Annex 1 without amendment  (see Article 55 ), if: 
- they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and  
- their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision 
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights  under Articles 22 and 23 also 
towards the third parties.  
11.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the costs related to the payment of the in -
kind contribution will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see  Article 42). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 6.  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 11  138 2. Additional cost eligibility condition: C osts of the payment to the third party, u p 
to the third parties’ costs  
The beneficiaries may declare their costs for paying the in -kind contribution  (e.g. the invoice  from 
the third party ), but only up to  the costs incurred by the third party  — if the other eligibility 
conditions are fulfilled (see in particular  Article 6.1  and 6.2; e.g. necessary for the action, 
recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary, etc.) .  
If the amount paid by the beneficiary is lower than the cost incurred by the third party, the 
beneficiary may in addition declare the difference as in -kind contributions free of charge (see 
Article 12 ). If it decides to do so, it may have to declare that difference also as receipt ( see Article 
5.3.3). 
For the upper limit (third party’s  costs), n ormally only the direct  costs actually  incurred by the 
third party will be taken into account . 
The following costs may however  be quantified using unit cost s (to ensure similar costing as 
for charging costs under the GA ): 
 for personnel costs : hourly rate  on the basis of usual costs accounting practices  
(alternative to actual costs; see Article 6.2.A.1 ) 
 for SME owner  costs: hourly rate  fixed by Commission  Decision C(2013) 819735 (see 
Article 6.2.A.4 ) 
 for internally invoiced goods and services : unit cost on the basis of usual accounting 
practices  (see Article 6.2.D.5 ) 
 for unit costs for clinical studies : unit cost fixed in the GA (alternative to actual costs; 
see Article 6.2.F ). 
The actual costs must be identifiable and verifiable in the third party’s accounts.  
The indirect  costs of the third party are  either : 
 NOT taken into account : if the resources (in -kind contribution) are used on the 
beneficiary’s premises  
or 
 taken into account : if the in -kind contr ibutions are NOT used on the beneficiary’s 
premises ( but, for instance, on the third party’s premises ). 
In this case, the direct costs actually incurred by the third party may be increased by a 
flat-rate of 25% on those costs . 
Example (no indirect costs of  the third party accepted ):  
A researcher is seconded to a beneficiary by a legal entity. This researcher works for the beneficiary on its 
premises. The third party charges the researcher’s direct costs (salary and related social security charges of 
EUR 50  000) and is reimbursed by the beneficiary.  
Additionally, the beneficiary has eligible direct costs of EUR 200 000.  
The third party’s direct costs equal EUR 50 000 .  
Total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary are:  
- total eligible direct costs: EUR 200  000 (direct  costs of beneficiary) + EUR 50 000 ( up to the 
amount of third party’s direct costs) = EUR 250 000  
- eligible indirect costs ; 25%* EUR 250 000 = EUR 62 500. No work was subcontracted, and no 
financial support by third parties was given.  
TOTAL el igible costs declared by the beneficiary: EUR 250 000 + EUR 62 500 = EUR 312 500  
Example (direct costs of third party plus a 25% flat -rate for indirect costs):

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 11  139 A legal entity makes available to a beneficiary the use of an installation or specialised piece  of infrastructure 
that the beneficiary needs for the action. The third party charges the full direct and indirect costs of this and 
is reimbursed by the beneficiary.  
The costs of the third party equal EUR 20 000 of actual direct costs plus EUR 8 000 of a ctual indirect costs. 
This is a cost for the beneficiary, which may declare  it for the action. However, since in H2020 actions 
indirect costs are reimbursed on the basis of a flat -rate of 25% of the direct eligible costs (calculated as 
indicated in Article 6.2.E of the GA), the beneficiary will declare as eligible costs for in -kind contributions 
against payment only EUR 20 000 (payment of third party’s direct costs) + EUR 5 000 for (cap for payment 
of third party’s indirect costs) (flat -rate of 25% of  20 000) = EUR 25 000.  
Additionally, the beneficiary has got eligible direct costs of EUR 200 000.  
Total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary are:  
- total eligible direct costs: EUR 200 000 (direct costs of the beneficiary)+ EUR 25 000 (eligible costs  
of in-kind contributions against payment) = EUR 225 000  
- eligible indirect costs: EUR 50 000= 25%* EUR 200 000 (direct costs of the beneficiary, excluding 
costs of in -kind contributions not used in its premises). No work was subcontracted, and no 
financial  support by third parties was given.  
TOTAL eligible costs declared by the beneficiary: EUR 225 000 + EUR 50 000 = EUR 275 000.  
If an audit shows that the costs declared by the beneficiary are higher than those incurred by the 
third party, the difference wi ll be rejected as ineligible (even if they correspond to the amount 
actually paid by the beneficiary).  
 
3. Additional  cost eligibility condition: Third parties and their contributions be set 
out in Annex 1 — Simplified a pproval procedure  
The third parties , their in-kind contributions  (i.e. non -financial resources ) and an estimation of 
the costs budgeted  for the in -kind contributions must be set out in Annex 1  of the GA.   
If the in -kind contributions  are NOT used on the beneficiary’s premises, their estimated costs  must 
be also set out in Annex 2  (additional information column).  
New in -kind contributions  — If the need for third parties’ in -kind contributions was not known 
at the moment of the signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendm ent of the 
GA in order to introduce it in the Annex 1  (see Article 55 ). Exceptionally, t he Commission/Agency 
may approve costs related to in -kind contributions not included in Annex 1 without formally 
amending the GA (simplified approval procedure ). 
Example  (approval) : A new researcher  is brought into a team working during the action’s second year of 
implementation. The beneficiary fails to inform the coordinator of the fact that this researcher is seconded 
from a public research centre to the beneficiary (a university), and therefore the GA is not amended (to 
include this in Annex 1). These circumstances are explained and justified in the technical report which 
includes the work carried out by this researcher.  
Approval will NOT be granted if the in -kind contribution risks to substantially change the 
nature of the project (i.e. there is doubt whether the project is still (in substance) the same as 
the one that was selected or whether the beneficiary has still the operational capacity to carry 
out the action).  
Example (no approval):  A propos al includes a beneficiary owning a prestigious laboratory and employing 
a specialised team of technicians in the field of the call. The proposal is selected after evaluation, taking into 
account the value provided by the involvement of this laboratory in t he action. The GA is signed, but then 
the beneficiary decides to carry out the tests in another laboratory of a third party, without informing the 
Commission and amending the GA.   
 
 
 
 
 The approval is at the discretion of the Commission/Agency and there is no automatic entitlement to it. 
Benefic iaries that rely on  the simplified approval procedure  bear the  full risk  of non -approval and rejection 
of costs by the Commission/Agency.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 11  140 4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the third parties (by the 
Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the impact of the action   
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits, 
and investigations on the third parties (see Article 22 ), and in particular audit the ir underlying 
costs.  
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
impact of the action under Article 23 . 
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the third 
parties  (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility 
of the costs, it will reject them).  
 
Specific cases  (in-kind contributions ): 
Foundations, spin -off companies, etc., created in order to manage the administrative tasks of 
the beneficiary and which are paid directly by the coordinator  — These are typically legal entit ies 
(third part ies) created or controlled by the beneficiary (usually a public body like a universit y/ministr y) 
which handle the financi al and administrative aspects of the beneficiaries’ involvement in research 
projects.  
Their tasks may include, among others, the employment of personnel, purchase of equipment or 
consumables that the third party puts at disposal of the beneficiary to carr y out the work of the 
project.  
Sometimes  they also include  the handling of the EU contribution  (which means that the beneficiary 
will use the bank account of  the third party  and that all payments made to that account count for 
the beneficiary) .  
The contributions made  by these entities are usually qualified as in -kind contributions against payment. 
If the cost s for the services are  not recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary (e.g. there is no invoice 
from the entity ): 
 the beneficiary has to prove that such practice is in line with national law and applicable  
accounting standards  
 the costs must be recorded in the accounts of the third party.

1. In-kind contributions by third parties free of charge  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions  provided 
by third parties free of charge.  
This Article refers to the case where a third party makes available some of its resources to a 
beneficiary, for free (i.e. without any payment, contrary to the case covered by Article  11). In 
this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and th ere is therefore NO cost incurred by 
the beneficiary.  However, the GA provides that it may charge the costs incurred by the third 
party for its in-kind contribution  (see also Article 6.4 ). 
Examples (in -kind contributions free of charge):  
Civil servant working as a professor in a public university. His salary is paid not by the beneficia ry (the 
university) but by the g overnment (the ministry). The b eneficiary will declare these salary costs in its individual 
financial statements, even if they are paid by a third party (the ministry/ government).

If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions  provid ed by third 
parties free of charge .  
The beneficiaries may declare costs incurred by the third parties  for the seconded persons, contributed 
equipment, infrastructure or other assets or other contributed goods and services as eligible in accordance 
with Article 6.4.  
The third parties and their contributions must be  set out in Annex 1. The [Commission] [Agency]  may 
however approve in -kind contributions not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55 ), if: 
- they are speci fically justified in the periodic technical report and  
- their use  does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision 
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.

12.2  Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the costs incurred by the third parties 
related to the in -kind contribution will be ineligible (see  Article 6) and will be rejected (see  Article 42). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Se ction 1 > Article 12  142 The beneficia ries may declare the costs of the third party for the in -kind contribution, if the 
eligibility conditions set out in Article 12.1 and  in Article 6.4  are fulfilled ( e.g. actually incurred by 
the third party, necessary for the action, incurred during the action duration, etc.) . 
The costs must be recorded in the accounts of the third party .  
Normally , only the direct  costs actually  incurred by  the third party  may be declared .  
The following costs may however (alternatively) be quantified using unit costs (to ensure 
similar costing as for charging costs under the GA):  
 for personnel costs: hourly rate on the basis of usual costs accounting practi ces 
(alternative to actual costs; see Article 6.2.A.1 ) 
 for SME owner costs: hourly rate fixed by Commission  Decision C(2013) 819736 (see 
Article 6.2.A.4 ) 
 for internally invoiced goo ds and services: unit cost on the basis of usual accounting 
practices  (see Article 6.2.D.5 ) 
 for unit costs for clinical studies: unit cost fixed in the GA (alternative to actual costs; 
see Article 6.2.F ). 
The indirect  costs of the third party are  either : 
 NOT taken into account : if the resources (in -kind contribution) are used in the 
beneficiary’s premises  
or 
 taken into account : if the in -kind contributions are used on the third party’s premises.  
In this case, the direct costs actually incurred by the third party may be increased by 
a flat-rate of 25% on those costs ; but the beneficiary may NOT include them a second 
time to calculate  its own indirect costs.  
Free of char ge in-kind contributions may also have to be declared as receipts (see Article 5.3.3(c) ) 
— capped by the amount declared as third party costs for the contribution . 
If an audit shows that the direct costs declared by the beneficiary are higher than those incurred 
by the third party, the difference will be rejected as ineligible.  
 
3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Third parties and their contributions set out 
in Annex 1 — Simplified approval procedure  
The third parties , their in-kind contributions  and an estimation of the costs budgeted  for the 
in-kind contributions must be mentioned in Annex 1 of the GA.   
If the in-kind contributions  are NOT used on the beneficiary’s premises, their estimated costs  must 
be also set out in Annex 2  (additional information column).  
New in -kind contributions  — If the need for third parties’ in -kind contributions was not known 
at the m oment of the signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendment  of the 
GA in order to introduce it in the Annex 1  (see Article 55 ). Exceptionally, t he Commission/Agency 
may approve costs related to in -kind contributions not included in Annex 1 without formally 
amending the GA ( simplified approval procedure ; for details, see Article 11 ).

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 12  143 4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the third parties (by the 
Commission/Age ncy, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
investigations on the third parties (see Article 22 ), and in particular to audit the ir costs.  
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
impact of the action under Article 23 .  
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the third 
parties  (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility 
of the costs, it will reject them).

ARTICLE  13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 Rules for subcontracting  action tasks  
13.1.1 If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may award subcontracts covering the 
implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.  
The beneficiaries must award the sub contracts ensuring the best value for money  or, if appropriate, the 
lowest price . In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see  Article 35 ).  
[OPTION:  In addition, if the value of the subcontract to be awarded exceeds EUR [ …], the beneficiaries 
must comply with the following rules: [ …]28] 
[OPTION for actions involving PCP or PPI : In addition, for the pre -commercial procurement (PCP) or 
procurement of in novative solutions (PPI), the beneficiaries must follow a transparent and non -
discriminatory procedure, including at least the following:  
(a) an ‘open market consultation ’ published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  via a 
‘prior information notice  (PIN) ’ and promoted and advertised widely;  
(b) a ‘contract notice ’ allowing for a time -limit for receipt of tenders of at least 2 months, 
published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  and promoted and advertised widely;  
(c) a ‘request for tenders ’ based on functional or performance -based specifications (that take into 
account the outcome of the open market consultation) and describing the practical set -up for 
the implementation of the subcontract(s);  
(d)  an objective and non -discriminatory evaluation  of the tenders and award of subcontract(s) to 
the tender(s) offering best value for money ; 
(e) a ‘contract award notice ’ published in the  Official Journal of the European Union . 
The beneficiaries must also ensure that every prior information notice, contract notice or contract award 
notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer:  
 “This procurement receives funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
programme under the grant agreement No [number]). The EU is however not participating as a contracting 
authority in this procurement .”] 
[OPTION 1 only for actions involving PPI: Participation in PPI tendering procedures must be open on 
equal terms to tenderers from EU Member States, associated countries and  other countries with which the 
EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement. If the WTO Government Procurement Agreement 
applies, PPI subcontracts must also be open to tenderers from States that have ratified this agreement.  
If the procurement o f the innovative solution (PPI) consists (and is limited to) buying a set of prototypes 
and/or test products that were developed during a preceding PCP action, the beneficiaries do not need to 
make an open market consultation, contract notice and contract award notice under Points (a), (b) and (e) 
above. In this case, they must  make a request for tenders  from at least three providers  (including the 
providers that participated in the preceding PCP), in accordance with the negotiated procedure without 
publica tion under Directives 2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17/EC  (or 2014/25/EU)29.]  
 
28 If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality, taking into account the value of the 
contracts and the relative size of the EU contributions in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Specific ru les must be based on the rules 
contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable provisions should be avoided. S pecific rules may only be set 
for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR  60 000. The authorising offi cer may set a threshold higher than EUR  60 000 on the basis of a risk 
assessment.  
29 See Articles 28 and 31(2)(a) of Directive 2004/18/EC replaced by Articles 26 and 32(3)(a) of Directive 2014/24/EU and Article  40(3)(b) of Directive 
2004/17/EC replaced by Article 50(b) of Directive 2014/25/EU.

 [OPTION 2 only for actions involving PCP: The subcontracts for pre -commercial procurement must 
provide for the following:  
- the ownership, by the subcontractors, of the intellectual property rights on the results that they 
generate;  
- the right of the buyers to access results — on a royalty -free basis — for their own use;  
- the right of the buyers to grant (or to require the subcontrac tors to grant) non -exclusive licences to 
third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable conditions — (without the right to 
sub-licence);  
- the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer to the buyers the ownership of intellectual property  
generated by subcontractors during the PCP, if subcontractors fail to commercially exploit the 
results within the period set out in the subcontract;  
- the right of the buyers to publish — at the time of the contract award notice — the identity of the 
winnin g tenderers and a project summary provided by the winning tenderers, and to publish — 
after R&D has finished and after consulting the subcontractors — summaries of the results as well 
as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed the last phase of the PCP.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the majority of the research and development work done by the 
subcontractor(s) (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
associated countries (‘place of performance obligation’). ] 
The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1  and the 
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2 . The 
[Commission] [Agency]  may however approve  subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 and 2 without 
amendment  (see Article 55 ), if: 
- they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and  
- they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks involving classified information  may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Article 37 ).] 
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights  under Articles 22  and 23 also 
towards their subcontractors.  
13.1.2 The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply  to the 
subcontractors.  
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) 
or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC  (or 2014/25/EU) must comply  with 
the applicable national law on public procurement.  
13.2  Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1, the costs related to the subcontract 
concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see  Article 42). 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  146 
 
1. Subcontracting  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may award subcontracts covering the 
implementation  of certain action tasks  described in Annex 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Characteristics  of subcontracting : 
 Based on business conditions   
This means that the subcontractor charges a price, which usually includes a profit  (— this 
distinguishes it from  linked third parties ; see Article 14 ). 
 Subcontractor works without the direct supervision of the beneficiary and is not 
hierarchically subordinate to the beneficiary  (— this distinguishes it from action tasks 
implemented by in -house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2 ). 
 Subcontractor's motivation is pecuniary, not the research work itself. The subcontractor  is 
paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work. 
 Responsibility towards  the EU/Euratom  for the subcontracted work lies fully with the 
beneficiary . 
The beneficiary remains responsible for all its rights and obligations under the GA, including 
the tasks carried out by a subcontractor.  
 Subcontractor has no rights or obligations towards  the Commission /Agency  or the other 
beneficiaries (it has no contractual relation with them ). 
Exam ples (subcontracts):  
Testing and analysis of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures, if described in Annex 1 
as action task.  
Only limited parts of the action  may be subcontracted — except for actions involving PCP/PPI  
(because the PCP/PPI action tasks are by definition fully subcontracted).  
The b eneficiaries must make special arrangements regarding results  produced by the 
subcontrac tors (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see Article 
26.3).  
 
 
  Article 13 contains both additional cost eligibility  conditions (in Article 13.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 13.1.2).  
 
. 
 
 
 Subcontractors — Subcontractors participate in the action by carrying out action tasks for the 
beneficiary.  They are NOT beneficiaries and therefore have no direct obligations under the grant 
agreement (but their beneficiaries must ensure that they comply with certain key obligations).  
Subcontract — For the purposes of the GA, a ‘ subcontract ’ means the purchase of goods, works or 
services that are identified in Annex 1 as action tasks . 
Example (subcontracts):   Contracts for  (parts of) the research or innovation tasks mentioned in Annex 1 . 
The differences between purchase contracts, subcontracts, in -kind contributions against payment and 
implementation by linked third parties  are explained in Article 8 . 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Security obligations — Stricter rules apply for  action tasks that involve information that is EU-
classified  or results that are subject to limited disclosure/dissemination  in Annex 1 of the GA  (see 
Article 37 ). 
 For more information on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classified 
information in EU research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  147  
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Best value  for money or lowest price  
The beneficiaries must base t heir subcontract s either on the best value  for money (considering the 
quality of the  service proposed, i.e. the best price -quality ratio ) or on the lowest price.  
This requirement reflects t he general cost eligibility con dition  set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii)  
(i.e. that costs must be reasonable and comply with the principle of sound financial 
management)  and applies it  specifically to the subcontracting context .  
The best value  for money principle does NOT in all cases require competitive selection 
procedures . However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must demonstrate how 
best value  for money was ensured.  
For the best price -quality ratio, price is an essential aspe ct (together with quality criteria, such 
as technical quality, etc.), but i t is NOT automatically necessary to select the offer with the 
lowest price . Selecting the lowest price may however be appropriate for automatic award 
procedures where the subcontrac t is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and 
quotes the lowest price.  
In order to provide a good analysis of the price -qualit y ratio, the criteria defining quality 
must be clear and coherent with the purposes of the action task that is subcont racted.  
 
3. Additional cost eligibility conditions for actions involving PCP or PPI  
This additional option will be inserted into the GA if the action involves pre -commercial 
procurement (PCP) or procurement of innovative solutions (PPI) . 
 
 
 
The additional rules mirror the key obligations for PCP/PPI actions from the H2020 MGA PCP/PPI .  
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Tasks set out in Annex 1 — Total estimated 
costs of subcontracting set out in Annex 2 — Simplified approval procedure  
The tasks  to be implemented  and the estimated cost  for each subcontract must be set out in 
Annex 1.  
It is the work ( i.e. the action tasks) to be performed by a subcontractor that must be  identified 
in Annex 1. The name  of the subcontractors is in principle not nece ssary .  
The description should also include an estimation of costs for each subcontract.  
Moreover, it  should explain the need for a subcontract, taking into account the specific 
characteristics of the action.  
 
Additionally, the total estimated costs for subcontracting  per beneficiary must appear in the 
table of estimated costs of Annex 2.  
  If the name  of the subcontractor is known at the time of the grant signature the beneficiary may 
indicate it in Annex 1. However, the fact that the name of the subcontractor is indicated in Annex 1 does not 
imply the ap proval of the Commission of the subcontract (or the subcontracting costs). For example, if the 
subcontractor was not selected based on best value -for-money the Commission may reject the costs even if 
its name was indicated in Annex 1.  
 
. 
 
 
 
  This concerns research and innovation actions or innovation actions with a PCP or PPI .  
This should NOT be confused  with PCP/PPI action  (separate  type of action, which use a different model 
grant agreement  and whose main action task  is the implementation of the  PCP or PPI) . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  148 New subcontracts  — If the need for a subcontract is not foreseen at the moment of the 
signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendment of the GA in order to introduce 
it in Annex 1 and 2  (see Article 55 ). Exceptionally, the Commi ssion/Agency may approve costs 
related to subcontracts not included in Annex 1 and 2 without formally amending the GA  
(simplified approval procedure ). 
The new subcontract must be included and explained in the technical periodic report ( in the 
section ‘unforeseen subcontractor’ ).  
Approval will NOT be granted if the subcontract risks to substantially change the nature of the 
project (i.e. there is a doubt whether the project is still (in substance) the same as the one 
that was selected or whether the bene ficiary has still the operational capacity to carry out the 
action).  
Example (approval): A beneficiary loses some personnel specialised in a particular field, and as a result 
decides to subcontract some tasks it had originally foreseen to carry out itself . The beneficiary fails to 
inform the coordinator of this fact and therefore the GA is not amended. These circumstances are declared 
in the periodic report and it is approved by the Commission.  
Example  (no approval) : A key beneficiary leaves the consortium and the coordinator subcontracts a ll the 
tasks of this beneficiary.   
 
 
 
 
5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the subcontractor (by the 
Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to ca rry out checks, reviews, audits  and 
investigations on the subcontractor (see Article 22 ). 
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
impact of the action under Article 23 .  
It is t he beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the 
subcontractor s (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the 
eligibility of the costs, it will reject them).  
 
6. ‘Other obligation ’: Extension of obligations under the GA to subcontractors  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontractors comply with certain obligations under the 
GA. 
Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors:  
 Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35 )  
 Maintain ing confidentiality (see Article 36) 
 Promot ing the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
 Liability for damages (see Article 46). 
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the 
subcontractors.  
Best practice:  In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, t he beneficiaries should  impose 
contractual arrangements on the third parties.  
 The approval is at the  full discretion  of the Commission/Agency and there is no automatic entitlement to 
it. Benefic iaries that rely  on the simplified approval procedure  bear the  full risk  of non -approval and 
rejection of costs by the Commission/Agency.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  149 7. ‘Other obligation ’: Compliance with national procurement rules  
Beneficiar ies that are ‘contracting authorit ies’ or ‘contracting entit ies’ (within the meaning of the 
EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU37) must moreover  comply with 
the applic able national law on public procurement . These rules normally provide for a special 
procurement procedure for the types of contracts they cover.  
‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by 
public law, associa tions formed by one or several of such authorities or one or several of such 
bodies governed by public law (see Article 2.1(1) of Directive  2014/24/EU). 
‘Bodies  governed by public law’ also include entities financed mostly by the State, regional 
or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law and entities controlled by those 
bodies ( for the full definition, see Article 2.1(4) of that Directive ). 
‘Contracting entities’ means entities operating in a utilities sector (water, energy, transport, 
postal services). They may be contracting authorities, public under takings or entities operating 
on the basis of special or exclusive rights (for the full definition see Article 4 of Directive 
2014/25/EU).  
 
Specific cases  (subcontracting) : 
Subcontracting between beneficiaries  — Is NOT allowed in the same GA. All beneficiaries contribute 
to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another in order to perform 
its part of the work it is the s econd beneficiary who should declare the costs for that work.  
Subcontracting to  affiliates  — Is NOT allowed, unless they have a framework contract or the affiliate 
is their usual provider, and the subcontract is priced at market conditions. Otherwise, the se affiliates 
may work in the action, but they must be identified as linked third parties under Article 14  and declare 
their own costs.  
Coordination tasks of the coordinator  (e.g. distribution of funds, review of reports and o thers tasks 
listed under Article 41.2(b) ) — Can NOT be subcontracted. Other activities of the coordinator may in 
principle be subcontracted.  
Framework contracts or subcontracts  — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if 
this is the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service ). In order to be eligible , the 
framework contract  must (have) be(en) awarded  on the basis of best -value -for-money and absence of 
conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily have to  be concluded before the start 
of the action.

However, the following relationships between legal entities shall not in themselves constitute contro lling relationships:  
(a) the same public investment corporation, institutional investor or venture -capital company has a direct or indirect holding of 
more tha n 50% of the nominal value of the issued share capital or a majority of voting rights of the shareholders or associates;  
(b) the legal entities concerned are owned or supervised by the same public body.  
31 ‘Third party with a legal link to a beneficiary’  is an y legal entity which has a legal link to the beneficiary implying collaboration that 
is not limited to the action.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14  151 This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 6  and other provisions) will 
be inserted into the GA if the action is implemented with linked third parties.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Characteristics of implementation by linked third parties:  
 Linked third party does not charge a price, but declares its own costs  for implementing the 
action tasks .  
 Linked third party itself performs certain action tasks directly and is responsible f or them 
towards  the beneficiary . Linked third parties do NOT sign  the GA (and are therefore not 
beneficiaries).  
 The beneficiary remains responsible towards  the Commission /Agency  for the work carried 
out by the linked third party.   
Moreover, the beneficiaries are financially responsible for any undue amount paid by the 
Commission /Agency  as reimbursement of costs for their linked third parties — unless the 
GA foresees joint and several liability  (see Article 44.1 ). 
 Work is attributed to the linked third party (in Annex 1) and is usually carrie d out on its 
premises .  
 Work is under the full and direct control, instructions and management of the linked third 
party, who carries out this part of the action (with its employees ). 
Only affiliated entities  or entities with a legal link to a beneficiary  can be linked third 
parties.   
‘Entities with a legal link’ refers to an established relationship (between the third party and the 
beneficiary), which is:  
 broad and not specifically created for the work in the GA   
Accordingly, its duration must go beyond t he action duration and it usually pre -dates 
and outlasts the GA; ad hoc collaboration agreements or contracts to carry out work in 
the action are NOT covered. In this latter case, both legal entities should be 
beneficiaries.  
AND 
 a legal relationship.  
This may be either a legal structure ( e.g. the relationship between an association and 
its members ) or through an agreement or contract not limited to the action  (e.g. a 
collaboration agreement for research in a particular field) . 
If the only relation between t wo entities is a capital link  (i.e. ownership of part of the 
issued share capital), the entity may only participate as a linked third party if it is an 
‘affiliated entity’ (see below) . 
‘Affiliated entity’  means : 
 under the direct or indirect control of the beneficiary or  
 Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to participate in the action , like the beneficiary 
they are linked to.  They are NOT beneficiaries, but they are allowed to participate fully in the action and 
receive EU funding; t hey will therefore be treated f or many issues (including cost eligibility ; see Article 6.3 ) 
like beneficiaries  and their beneficiaries must ensure that they comply with certain key obligations.  
 Combin ing H2020 & other EU grants  — The terminologies  under different EU funds/funding 
programmes may differ (e.g. ‘linked third parties’ under H2020 are the SAME as ‘affiliated entities’ under  
the Financial Regulation , while  ‘affiliated entities ’ under H2020 is NARROW ER than ‘affiliated entities’ under 
the Financial Regulation  (see Articles  2.1(2) and 23(5) of the Rules for Participation  Regulation No  
1290/2013  and Article 122 of the Financial Regulation No  966/2012 ). 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14  152  under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary or  
 directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary.  
Affiliated entities cover not only the case of parent companies or holdings and their 
daughter companies or subsidiaries and  vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between 
themselves (e.g. entities controlled by the same entity) . 
Examples (entities with a legal link):  
1. Joint Research Units (JRU)  (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two or more 
different legal entities in order to carry out research)  — They do not have a  separate  legal personality, but form 
a single research unit where staff and resources from the diffe rent members are put together to the benefit of 
all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with premises, equipment, and resources individual 
to them and distinct from ‘owner’ entities. A member of the JRU is the beneficiary and any othe r member of the 
JRU contributing to the action and who is not a beneficiary of the GA has to be identified in Article 14. The JRU 
has to meet all the following conditions:  
 scientific and economic unity  
 last a certain length of time  
 recognised by a public a uthority.  
It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as such under 
the applicable  national law. The beneficiary must provide to the Commission/Agency, a copy of the 
resolution, law, decree, decision,  attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and the linked third 
party(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the ‘joint research unit’, or any other  document that 
proves that research facilitie s are put  in a common structure  and correspond to the concept of scientific and 
economic unit.  
2. Associations, foundations or other legal entities  composed of members  — That entity  is generally the 
beneficiary and the members are the linked third parties.  
Examples  (affiliated entities) :  
1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy. However, 
with 20% of the shares  it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore , company A controls company 
B and both companies may be linked third partie s in a H2020 GA.   
2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z. They are both 
considered affiliated entities.  
Linked third parties must fulfil the same conditions for participation  and funding under H2020  
as beneficiaries  (for instance, be established in an EU Member State, H2020 associated country or 
third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work Programme ).38 
Example:  Company A established in the UK is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French company and 
also owns C, an US company. B & C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may declare  costs as 
a third party linked to A, becau se company C is established in a third country  that is not eligible for funding 
under Arti cle 10 of the Rules for Participation  Regulation No 1290/2013 . 
 
 
 
They must be named  in Article 14 and their action tasks and estimated costs must be set out in 
Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or if the linked third party  is added 
later, through an amendment; see Article 55 ). 
The ben eficiaries must make special arrangements regarding results  produced by the linked third 
parties (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see Article 26.3 ).  
The Commission/Agency may (during th e selection procedure) require joint and several  
liability of a linked third party , if: 
 the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and 
 the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its linked third part y.

Manual . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article  14 153 Examples:  
1. The financially weak beneficiary is an association and most of the work is carried out by several of its 
members as linked third parties.  
2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work implemented by a 
bigger affiliated company.  
3. The proposal submitted by four independent entities established in four Member States is positively 
evaluated. The four successful applicants decide to form a legal entity to simplify the management of the 
project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary , i.e. a new legal entity . The successful applicants will 
carry out the work as linked third parties  of the new legal entity . 
If request ed, the third party must accept joint and several liability with the beneficiary.  
In this case it must sign a  declaration (on paper and in blue -ink, using Annex 3a) to be 
submitted by the beneficiary at the moment of its accession to the GA (or of the 
amendment introducing the linked third party in the GA ; see Article 56 ). The linked third 
party must send the original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery) , 
who must upload it (as a scanned PDF copy) in the system.  
 
 
The liability  is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the GA, and up to the linked 
third party’s  maximum EU contribution in Annex 2 . 
 
 
Entities performing a substantial part  of the work  (i.e. action tasks) should in principle  be 
beneficiar ies, NOT linked third parties. Linked third parties should only exceptionally perform  a 
major part of  the R&I work . 
Example s:  
1. Entities specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action  (e.g. EEIGs) .  
2. National  research associations established according to the national law in order to carry out research not 
limited to the action.  
3. A group of  legal entities (companies/research organisations) that have a common  research agenda and 
that have a  structure consisting of an association coordinating the research. This structure/consortium is not 
limited to the H2020 action and the members have strong contractual commitments among each other and 
the coordi nating association.  The association represents its members and coordinates administratively their 
work in the action, even if it is not performing any R&I work in the action. In this case , the association may 
be the beneficiary and the members of the assoc iation are its linked third parties  carrying out the R&I work . 
 
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Linked third parties identified in Article 14 
— Tasks set out in Annex 1 — Estimated costs set out in Annex 2 — No 
simplified approval procedure  
The linked third parties must be named in Article 14 and their tasks and estimated costs must be 
identified in Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or added later, through 
an amendment ; see Article 55 ). 
There is NO simplified approval procedure.   
 
 
  Article 14 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 14.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in Article 
14.1.2).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For more information on the financial capacity check, see the  Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its 
files.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14  154 3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Costs of the linke d third  party   
The linked third parties may declare their costs  (in their financial statements; see Article 20.3 ), if 
the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.3  are fulfilled (e.g. actually incu rred by the linked 
third party, necessary for the action, incurred during the action duration, etc.) .  
The costs must be recorded in the accounts of the linked third party.  
Linked third parties may declare costs for all cost categories (as provided for in Article 5 ), 
including indirect costs (at the 25% flat rate).  
Each linked third party declares its own costs. The costs of the linked third party must not be 
included in the beneficiary’s financial statements.  
Each linked third party has its own financial statements , but these statements must be 
submitted  by its ben eficiary  (since linked third parties cannot sign them in the IT system ; see 
Article 20 ).  
For this purpose, linked third parties must send their signed financial statements on paper to 
their beneficiary.  
 
 
Each linked third party has to provide its own certificate  on the financial statements  (CFS; 
see Article 20.4 ).  
The threshold of EUR 325 000 applies to each linked third party (independently of its 
beneficiary).  
 
 
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the linked third parties (by the 
Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to ca rry out checks, reviews, audits  and 
investigations on the linked third parties (see Article 22 ), and in particular to audit their costs and 
proper implementation of action tasks.  
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
impact of the action under Article 23 .  
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the linked 
third parties  (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the 
eligibility of the costs, it will reject them).  
 
5. ‘Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to linked third parties  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the linked third parties comply with certain obligations under 
the GA.  
Obligations that must be extended to linked third parties:  
 Record -keeping obligations (see Article 18 ) 
 Reporting (see Article 20 ) 
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its files  
(see Article 18.1.2 ).

PAR TNERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. International partners  
This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 4 ) will be inserted into the 
GA if the action is implemented with international partners.  It was introduced with GA version 4.0 
and does NOT automatically apply to older grant agreements  (however beneficiaries with older 
GAs may ask for an amendment to introduce international partners  see Article 55 ). 
 
 
 
 
Characteristics of implementation by  international partners:  
 International partners perform their action tasks directly. They do NOT sign the GA (and are 
therefore not beneficiaries).   
 The beneficiary remains responsible towards the Commission/Agency for the action tasks 
performed by its international partner.  ARTICLE 14a — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS  
[OPTION 1: 14a.1 Rules for calling upon international partners  to implement part of the action  
The following international partners37 may implement the action tasks attributed to them  in Annex 1:  
-  [name of the entity (short name) ], international partner of [ short name of the beneficiary ]  
-  [name of the entity (short name )], international partner of [ short name of the beneficiary ]  
[same for more international partners ]  
The costs of the international partners are estimated in Annex 2 but:  
 will not be reimbursed and 
 
 will not be taken into account for the calculation of the grant.  
 
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission  , the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles  22 and 23 also 
towards their international partners.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 18.1.1, 20.3(a), 20.4(a), 35, 36 and 38 
also apply to their international partners .  
14a.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a benefi ciary braches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 4 3).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of  the other measures described in Chapter 6. ] 
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ] 
37  ‘International partner’ is any legal entity established in a non -associated third country which is not eligible for funding under Article 10  
of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 . 
 International partners  — International partners  are allowed to participate in the action without EU 
funding. They are NOT beneficiaries and do NOT receive EU funding; they therefore have no direct 
obligations under the grant agreement (but their beneficiaries must to ensure that they comply with certain 
key obligations).  
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14a  157  International partners perform their action tasks without receiving EU funding, i.e. their 
costs are NOT eligible for reimbursement under the grant. Therefore, they will not be 
subject to financial checks, reviews or audits.  
The cost s of the international partners are estimated in Annex 2 (to get an overview of the 
overall project budget). B ut this is for information purposes only , the international partners 
are not required to report on their costs.  
International partners do NOT need  to have a (capital or legal) link to the beneficiary  (but they 
may have one) .  
They must NOT be eligible for funding , i.e. be: 
- a legal entity established in a third country not listed in General Annex A to the H2020  Work 
Programme  or 
Example:  A consortium of legal entities from EU Member States, H2020 associated countries and third 
countri es listed in General Annex A to the H2020  Work Programme  wants to work with a legal entity established 
in New Zealand. Since the New Zealand entity would like to be involved in the action without requesting EU 
funding and without becoming a beneficiary, one of the beneficiaries may decide to list the New Zealan d entity 
as its international partner and attribute certain action tasks to it (provided that the international partner 
agrees to the action tasks and the related obligations under the GA).  
- an international organisation other than international European interest organisations39. 
They may be used to implement any of the action tasks.  
They must be named  in Article 14a and their action tasks and estimated costs must be set out in 
Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or if the  international  partner is 
added later, through an amendment; see Article 55 ). 
The beneficiaries must make special arrangements regarding results  produced by the 
international partners  (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see 
Article 26.3 ).  
Although they are not beneficiaries and do not receive EU funding, their beneficiaries must ensure 
that they comply with certain key  (non-financial) obligations:  
Thus, they  must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22  to verify the 
proper im plementation of the action tasks and that the Commission/Agency has the right to make 
an evaluation of the impact of the action under Article 23 .  
Moreover, t hey must extend the following obligations under the GA to the interna tional partners:   
Obligations that must be extended to international partners:  
 Record -keeping obligations (on the scientific and technical implementation; see Article 
18.1.1 ) 
 Technical reporting  (in the required language; see Article 20.3(a) , 20.4(a)  and 20.7) 
 Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35 )  
 Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
 Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38). 
It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the 
international partner s.

1. Financial support to third parties  
This optional  Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 6  and other provisions ) will 
be inserted into the GA i f the action involves financial support to third parties (i.e. funding by the 
beneficiary of (one or more) recipi ents that are not party to the GA , also called ‘cascade 
funding ’). 
 
 
‘Financial support ’ may be given via  a financial donation to natural persons (e.g. allowance, 
scholarship, fellowship) or legal persons (e.g. non -repayable financial assistance to local 
NGOs) , seed money to start -ups or microcredit, or other forms . (For prizes, see Article 15.2 .) 
Examples:  
1. An innovation project in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for 
end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action.  
2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three researc h scholarships in the 
field of the action.  
                                                                                                                                               
Member States or associated  countries, and whose principle objective is to promote scientific and technological 
cooperation in Europe.  
 Actions may involve  financial support to third parties ONLY where this is explicitly allowed in the work

 ARTICLE 15 — FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THIRD PARTIES  
15.1 Rules for providing financial support to third parties  
[OPTION 1 to be used if foreseen in the work programme:  15.1.1  The beneficiaries must provide financial 
support in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex 1. 
At a minimum, these conditions  must include:  
(a)  the maximum amount of financial support for each third party.  
The maximum amount may not exceed EUR 60 000  for each third party, unless it is necessary to 
achieve the objectives of the action as described in Annex 1; 
(b)  the criteria for calculating the exact amount of the financial support;  
(c) the different types of activity that qualify for financial support, on the basis of a closed list;  
(d) the persons or categories of persons that may receive financial support, and  
(e) the criteria for giving financial support.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights  under Articles 22 and 23 also towards the 
third parties receiving financial support.  
15.1.2 The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46  also apply  to the 
third parties receiving financial support. ]

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 15.1  159 Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free)  by the beneficiary to a third party is NOT 
considered financial support.  
Linked third parties may provide  financial support to third parties under the same conditions as 
the beneficiaries.  
The recipients are not party to the GA and therefore do NOT need to be identified in the GA or 
have a PIC.  
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Conditions for support set out in Annex 1 — 
Maximum amount of the financial support — Types of activities — Categories of 
persons — Criteria for financial support  
The beneficiaries must comply with the conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and 
in particular:  
 the maximum amount p er third party  
The maximum amount may normally  NOT be more  than EUR 60  000 per recipient . A higher 
amount can exceptionally be set out in Annex 1, if the work programme/call explicitly 
allows it and the proposal (and Annex 1) explain why this is necessary  for the objectives of 
the action.  
This is a limit per recipient ; several recipients  could receive up to EUR  60 000 each (e.g. 3 
grants of EUR  50 000 each) . 
 the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support (e.g. EUR 2  000 per 
hectare; EUR  30 000 per student for a two -year scholarship)  
The financial support provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or 
the reimbursement of the costs incurred by the recipients  when  implementing  the 
supported activities ). 
 a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial support for 
third parties  (e.g. financial support for third parties allowed for technology -testing 
activities)  
These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT  the benefic iaries) . 
The financial support is NOT the same as subcontracting (see Article 13 ) or purchase of 
goods, works or services ( see Article 10 ). 
 the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD students)  
Beneficiaries should describe in Annex 1 the procedures for selecting the recipients . 
 the criteria for giving financial support  (e.g. physical characteristics of the a gricultural plots 
which make them suitable for the purpose of the action) . 
These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in  the work programme/ call. 
The conditions must also already be part of the  proposal (see the proposal templates ). 
 
  Article 15.1 contains b oth additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 15.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 15.1.2).

Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF ) — Evaluation of the im pact of the action  
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
investigations on the recipients (see Article 22 ). 
They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the

costs, it will reject them).  
 
4. ‘Other obligation ’: Extension of obligations under the GA to recipients  
The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper use of the funding by the recipients and must 
ensure that they comply with certain obligations under the GA.  
Obligations that must be extended to recipients:  
 Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35 )  
 Maintain ing confidentiality (see Article 36) 
 Promot ing the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38)

Best practice:  In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, t he beneficiaries should  to impose 
contractual arrangements on the recipients  (includ ing control measures and/or reducing the 
financial support).

(for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility of the 
costs, it will reject them).   
 
4. ‘Other obligation ’: Extension of obligations under the GA to recipients  
The beneficiaries are responsible for the award of the prize to the recipients and must ensure that 
they comply with certain obligations under the GA.  
Obligations that must be extended to rec ipients:  
 Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35 )  
 Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36 ) 
 Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38 ) 
 Liability for damages (see Article 46 ).

16.1 Rules for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  
[OPTION 1 for trans -national access to research infrastructure: 16.1.1 ‘Access providers ’32 must provide 
access to research infrastructure or installations33 in accordance with the following conditions:  
(a)  access  which must be provided : 
The access must be free of charge, trans -national access to research infrastructure or 
installations for selected user -groups.  
This access must include the logistical, technological and scientific support and the specific 
training that is usually provided to external researchers using the infrastructure.  
(b) categories of users that may have access : 
Trans -national access must be provided to selected ‘user-groups ’, i.e. teams of one or more 
researchers (users) led by a ‘user group leader ’.   
The user group leader and the majority of the users must work in a country other than the 
country(ies) where the installation is located.  
This rule does not apply:  
- if access is provided by an International organisation, the Joint Research Centre 
(JRC), an ERIC or similar legal entities;  
- in case of remote access to a set of installations located in different countries offering 
the same type of service.  
Only user groups that are allowed to disseminate the results they have generated under the 
action may benefit from the access , unless the u sers are working  for SMEs.  
Access  for user groups with a majority of users not working in a EU or associated country34 is 
limited  to 20  % of the total amount of units of access provided under the grant, unless a higher 
percentage is foreseen in Annex 1;  
(c) procedure and criteria for  selecting  user groups:  
The user groups must request access by  submitting (in writing) a description of the work that 
they wish to carry out and the names, nationalities and home institutions of the users . 
The user groups must be selected by a selection panel  set up by the access providers.  
The selection panel must be composed of international experts in the field, at least half of them 
independent from the beneficiaries, unless otherwise specified in Annex 1. 
The selection panel must assess all proposals received and recommend a short -list of the user 
groups that should benefit from access.  
The selection panel must base its selection on scientific merit, taking into account that priority 
should be given to user groups composed of users who:  
- have not previously used the installation  and

1. Trans -national access to research infrastructure  
This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 6  and other provisions) will 
be inserted into the GA  if the action involves trans -national access to rese arch infrastructure  for 
scientific communities (‘provision of access activities’), i.e.:  
 actions under Part I  of Horizon 2020 , ‘Research infrastructures’  under the following topics:  
 ‘integrating activities’ ( INFRAIA -1-2014-2015: Integrating and opening existing 
national and regional research infrastructures of European interest ) 
 ‘individual support’( INFRADEV -3-2015: Individual implementation and operation of

The access provider must request written approval from the [ Commission][Agency]  (see 
Article 52 ) for the selection of user groups requiring visits to the installation(s) exceeding 3 
months, unless such visits are foreseen in Annex 1.  
16.1.2 In addition, the access provider must:  
(a) advertise widely, including on a d edicated website, the access offered under the Agreement ; 
(b) promote equal opportunities in advertising the access and take into account the gender 
dimension when defining the support provided to users;  
(c) ensure that users comply  with the terms and conditions o f the Agreement;  
(d) ensure that its obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46  also apply  to the users.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 16.1  165 For ‘integrating activities’, access to research infrastructure is a mandatory component, 
while it is optional for the other two  topics.  ‘Cluster support’ actions currently only 
include pilot provision of trans -national access,  no virtual access (see the H2020 W ork 
Programme 2014 -2015). 
Grants for this type of action usually reimburse  — for the provision of access activity — the 
following types of costs : 
 ‘access costs’ (i.e. the  operating costs of the research infrastructure40 or installation41 and 
costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad -hoc 
user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation)  
 users’ travel and subsistence costs  
 costs of advertising the trans -national access offered under the action  
 costs related to the selection procedure (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and 
subsistenc e costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc. ) 
 costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the 
periodic technical reports (see Article 20.3 ). 
The a ccess costs may be declared as unit  costs, actual costs or — under certain conditions — 
as a combination of the two (see Articles 5.2(f)  and 6.2.F), while the other costs in this list 
must be declared as actual costs (see Articles 5.2(d)  and 6.2.D ). 
If access costs are declared as unit cost , they must be declared under the budget category 
F.2 ‘access costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastr ucture’ (see Article 
5.2(f)  and 6.2.F).  
If they are declared as actual costs , they must be declared under the other budget 
categories (see Articles 5.2(a -e) and 6.2.A -E). 
Capital investments (i.e. equipment costs for renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable 
equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed (for the provision of access 
activit ies; see Article 6.2.D.2 ). 
Trans -national access must be measured  (in ‘units of a ccess ’). 
The units of access for the various installations that provide trans -national acc ess under the 
grant must be specified in Annex 1 of the GA.  
Examples (units of access):  per beam -hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per number of 
frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per campaign -day for a 
research vessel.  
For trans -national access, the GA will always specify a unit of access (independently of 
whether the costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs) . 
 
 
 
                                            
40  For the definition  of research infrastructure , see Article 2(6) of the H2020 Framework Programme Regulation No 
(EU) No 1291/2013 and the footnote  in Article 6.2.D.4 of the MGA:  ‘Research infrastructure ’ are facilities, 
resources and services that are used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in 
their fields. Where relevant, they may be used beyond research, e.g. for  education or public services. They 
include: major scientific equipment (or sets of instruments); knowledge -based resources such as collections, 
archives or scientific data; e -infrastructure such as data and computing systems and communication networks; 
and any other infrastructure of a unique nature essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Such 
infrastructure may be ‘single -sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’.  
41  ‘Installation’  means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used independently from the 
rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 16.1  166  
 
 
 
In addition, t hey must include (just like for  virtual access ) detailed information on the provision of 
access activity in the periodic technical  reports  (see Article 20.3 ). 
 
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Access which must be provided   
Trans -national access can be  either:  
 in person  (hands -on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or  
 remote , through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services.  
Examples (remote access ): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus 
strain) ; performing a remote sample analysis or sample deposition; remote access to a high -
performance computing facility.  
Remote trans -national access requires competitive selection of the users to be served 
under the GA as usually it applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g. computing 
hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample) . It is thus different from virtual 
access , which  applies to resources that can be simulta neously used by an unlimited 
number of users (e.g. a dataset available on the internet) . 
Trans -national access must be  given to selected user groups (free of charge).  
 
3. Additional cost eligibility  condition : Categories of users that may have access — 
Limited access for special u ser groups  
For trans -national access, user groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third 
countries  may ONLY  have access for up to 20  % of the total number of units of access provided 
under the grant.  
The consort ium should itself define if this 20  % limit is uniformly applied to the different 
installations or if the above mentioned user groups may use some installations more than 
others. It should do this in the consortium agreement.  
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition : Selection procedure with a selection panel  
For trans -national access, access providers must set up a common selection panel  that regularly 
evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups that would  
benefit from access.  
If justified, an access provider may use several different selection sub -panels.  
Example:  Different thematic selection sub -panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities serving 
multidisciplinary communities.  
 
  Article 16.1 con tains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 16.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 16.1.2).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Record -keeping — The benef iciaries  must keep appropriate records a nd supporting documentation 
to justify the number of units of trans -national access for which they declare costs (see Article 18 ), 
including:  
 users’ names, nationalities and home institutions  
 the nature of access and  
 the number of units of access provided.

1. Virtual access to research infrastructure  
This optional Article ( together with the corresponding options in Article 6  and other provisions) will 
be inserted into the GA if the action involves virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific 
communities (‘provision of access activities’), i.e.  actions under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Research 
infrastructures’.  
Grants for this type of actions usually reimburse  — for the provision of access activity — the 
following types of costs : 
 ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the in stallation during the course of the action  
and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a helpdesk)  
 costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action  
 costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g. 
costs of organising a board meeting ) 16.2 Rules for providing virtual access to research infrastructure  
[OPTION 1 for virtual access to research infrastructure: ‘Access providers ’36 must provide access to 
research infrastructure or installations37 in accordance with the following conditions:  
(a) access  which must be provided : 
The access must be free of charge, virtual access to research infrastructure or installations.  
‘Virtual access ’ means open and free access through communication networks to resources 
needed for research, without selecting the researchers to whom access is provided;  
(b) other conditions:  
The access provider must have the virtual access services  assessed periodically by a board 
composed of international experts in the field, at least half of whom must be independent from 
the beneficiaries, unless otherwise specified in Annex 1. ]

16.3 Consequences of non -compliance  
[OPTION 1 to be used if 16.1 and/or 16.2 are applicable: If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations 
under Articles 16.1.1 and 16.2, the costs of access will be ineligible (see  Article 6 ) and will be rejected (see 
Article 42 ). 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Articles 16.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see  Article

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 16 .2 169  costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the 
periodic technical reports (see Article 20.3 ) and the assessment report (see below point 3). 
As from  the Work Programme 2020, the access costs may be declared as unit costs, 
actual costs or — under certain conditions — as a combination of the two (see Articles 
5.2(f)  and 6.2.F), while the other costs in this list must be declared as actual costs (see 
Articles 5.2(d)  and 6.2.D ). 
If access costs are declared as unit cost , they must be declared under the budget 
category F.2 ‘access costs for providing trans -national access to research 
infrastructure’ (see Article 5.2(f)  and 6.2.F).  
If they are declared as actual costs , they must be declared under the other budget 
categories (see Articles 5.2(a -e) and 6.2.A -E). 
Capital invest ments (i.e. costs of renting, leasing, purchasing depreciable equipment, 
infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed — unless provided for in the work 
programme/call . In this case only the portion used to provide virtual access under the project is 
eligible.   
Virtual access may or may not be measured . If measured, the GA will specify a unit of access.  
When the research infrastructure access policy requires the identification of users, the EU financial 
support to virtual access will cover the access costs  incurred by the infrastructure or installation 
for the provision of access under the grant to the identified users. The proposal can also define 
eligibility criteria (e.g. af filiation to a research or academic institution) for the users to whom 
access will be provided under the grant  
When access is provided without identifying user s, the research infrastructures virtual services to 
be supported by the EU  must be widely used by  the European research  community42.  
The b eneficiaries  must provide  detailed information on the provision of access activity in the 
periodic technical  reports  including, when access is provided without identifying users, statistics 
on all users in the report ing period  compiled through web analytical tools  (see Article 20.3 ). 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Access which must be provided   
Virtual access applies to widely -used research resources that are openly and freely available 
through communication networks . 
Example:  access to an open database available on the internet   
Access must be  open to all users; users are not selected.  
3. Additional cost eligibility condition : Periodic assess ment  by a board of 
international experts  
For virtual access, the access services must be regularly assessed by  an external board  of 
international experts . 
At least two assessments  are usually carried out during the course of an action.  
The assessment reports must already be part of the proposal (as deliverables ; see the proposal 
templates ) and be included in Annex 1  of the GA.  
                                            
42  Under the H2020 -INFRAEOSC -2018-2020 call , other communities could be considered in o rder to widen the user 
base.  
  Article 16.2 contains additional cost eligibility conditions.

monitoring the action or assessing reports and requests for payment;  reviews ; audits ; 
investigations ; evaluation of the action’s impact) .  
It may request any type  of information it needs  (including personal data, to order to verify 
that costs declare d for specific people are eligible; see Article 39 ). The level of detail will 
depend on the purpose of the request.  
The Commission /Agency  may request the information at  any time , either during the action or 
afterwards.  
 Examples:  
1. In an ex -post financial audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the Commission/Agency may 
request any information it needs during the procedure. The audit may continue beyond the two years after 
the balance is paid  (see Article 22 ). 
2. The Commission may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the action’s impact 
up to five years after the balance is paid  (see Article 23 ). 
3. The b eneficiaries must comply with any additional exploitation obligations set out in Annex 1, for up to 
four years after the action ends (see Article 3 ). They are therefore obliged to provide any information the 
Commission/Agency r equests to verify that the action was correctly implemented and that the beneficiaries 
complied with their obligations under the GA.  
The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the format 
and within the deadline re quested (see Article 22 ). 
It is the coordinator who usually provides the information requested — unless the GA specifies 
direct communication with the other beneficiaries (see Articles 20 , 22, 23, 30, 41, 55).  
If the coordinator no longer exists  after the action ends (e.g. if it went bankrupt) , benef iciaries 
may provide the information requested directly to the Commission/Agency.  
Until the balance is paid, all information is sent via the Funding & Tenders Portal . Afterwards, 
information requests may have to be  sent in writing by registered post with proof of delivery (see 
Article 52 ). 
 
2. Information in the Participant  Register  
Each beneficiary must keep its information in the  Participant Register  up-to-date, including after 
the end of the grant . 
 
 
The information  includes:  
 name  
 address  
 legal representatives  
 legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L. ) 
 organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.) . 
The IT system automatically informs the coordinator whenever a beneficiary updates its 
information.  
 
 
  Updated information remains necessary bot h to contact the beneficiaries  after the end of the action and 
if they want to participate in other EU grants .  
 
.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 17  172  
3. Information likely to delay or affect the action or EU  financial interests  
Each beneficiary must immediately inform the coordinator if an event is likely to significantly affect 
or delay the action’s implementation  or affect the EU financial interests.  
Examples  (situation likely to significantly affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect 
the EU financial interests): a beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary 
is bought by another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its laboratory from a Member State to a non -
EU country  
The b eneficiaries must also inform the coordinator about any changes concerning their linked 
third parties.  
For events linked to changes that also r equire an update of the Participant  Register (see 
above) , the beneficiary must update the Participant Register  and inform the coordinator . 
The beneficiary must inform the coordinator offline, via its usual communication channels 
(e.g. e -mail, registered letters with proof of delivery , etc.).   
Best practice:  It is recommended that the beneficiary informs the coordinator in writing  (not 
only orally).  
After receiving the information from the beneficiary, the coordinator must immediately inform:  
 the Commission/Agency, via the Funding & Tenders P ortal 
 the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels  (in writing and  offline).  
 
4. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or 
compliance with requirements under the GA  
Each beneficiary must immediately inform the coordinator about any situation that:  
 could have affected the decision to award the grant if it had been known by the evalu ators 
at the time of evaluation  or 
 could affect the fulfilment of obligations under the GA.  
Example (situation that could have affected the decision to award the grant or compliance with 
requirements under the GA ): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a laboratory with 
specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally -renowned experts i n the same field as 
the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators 
when the grant was awarded. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary sells the laboratory to an 
external compa ny, losing a good part of the relevant expertise, and as a result has to outsource part of the 
work.

 ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default:  five][ OPTION 2 for low value grants38: 
three]  years after the payment of the balance — keep records and other su pporting documentation in order 
to prove the proper implementation of the action and the costs they declare as eligible.  
They must make them available upon request (see  Article 17 ) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits o r 
investigations (see  Article 22 ). 
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see  Article 22 ), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents . Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission] [Agency]  may accept non -
original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance.   
18.1.1 Records  and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation  
The beneficiaries must keep records and other supporting documentation on scientific and technical 
implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in the re spective field.  
18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support the costs declared  
The beneficiaries must keep the records and documentation supporting the costs declared, in particular the 
following:  
(a) for actual  costs : adequate records and other supporti ng documentation to prove the costs 
declared, such as contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records. In addition, the 
beneficiaries’ usual cost accounting practices and internal control procedures must enable 
direct reconciliation between the am ounts declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and 
the amounts stated in the supporting documentation;  
(b) for unit costs : adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the number of 
units declared. [OPTION for trans -national access to r esearch infrastructure:  This 
documentation must include records of the names, nationalities, and home institutions of 
users , as well as the nature and quantity of access provided to them. ] Beneficiaries do not 
need to identify the actual eligible costs covered or to keep or provide supporting 
documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount per unit.     
In addition, for unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficia ry’s usual cost 
accounting practices , the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation to 
prove that the cost accounting practices used comply with the conditions set out in Article 6.2.  
The beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  may submit  to the Commission, for approval, a 
certificate (drawn up in accordance with Annex 6) stating that their usual cost accounting 
practices comply with these conditions (‘ certificate on the methodology ’). If the certificate is 
approved, costs declared in line  with this methodology will not be challenged subsequently, 
unless the beneficiaries have concealed information for the purpose of the approval.  
(c) for flat -rate costs : adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the 
eligibility of the costs to which the flat -rate is applied. The beneficiaries do not need to 
identify the costs covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accounting 
statements) to prove the amount declared at a flat -rate[;][.]

1. Records and other supporting documentation  
The b eneficiaries (for linked third parties , see point 10 ) must keep appropriate and sufficient 
evidence to prove  the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implement ation of  the action  and 
compliance with all the other obligation s under the GA . 
 
 
 
‘Sufficiency ’ relates to the quantity of evidence; ‘appropriateness ’ relates to its quality.  
Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough for the auditors, 
who assess it according to generally accepted audit standards.43 
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  
It must be cor rectly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid ( 3 years for grants up  
to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or 
litigation) . In this case , the evidence must be kept until they end.  
                                            
43  International Standard on Auditing ISA 500 ‘Audit Evidence’.  
 Costs that are not supported  by appr opriate and sufficient evidence  may be rejected  (and other 
measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).  
. 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (d) [OPTION  if lump sum foreseen in Article 5.2 : for lump sum costs : adequate records and 
other supporting documentation to prove  that the corresponding tasks or part of the action as 
described in Annex 1 were implemented properly. The beneficiaries do not need to ident ify the 
actual eligible costs covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accounting 
statements) to prove the amount declared as a lump sum. ] 
In addition,  for personnel costs  (declared as actual costs or on the basis of unit costs), the beneficiaries 
must keep time records for the number of hours declared. The time records must be in writing and approved 
by the persons working on the action and their supervisors, at least month ly. In the absence of reliable time 
records of the hours worked on the action, the [Commission] [Agency]  may accept alternative evidence 
supporting the number of hours declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance.  
As an exception , for persons working exclusively on the action , there is no need to keep time records, if 
the beneficiary signs a declaration  confirming that the persons concerned have worked exclusively on the 
action.  
[OPTION  to be added if Article 14 applies : For costs declared by linked third parties (see  Article 14 ), it is 
the beneficiary that must keep the originals of the financial statements and the certificates on the financial 
statements of the linked third parties. ] 
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be 
ineligible (see Article 6 ) and will be  rejected (see  Article 42 ), and the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
38 For the definition, see Article 185 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No  1268/2012 of 29  October 2012 on the rules of 
application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No  966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to 
the general budget of the Union  (OJ L 362, 31.12.2012, p. 1) (‘ Rules of Application Regulati on No 1268/2012 ’): ‘low value grants’  
are lower or equal to EUR 60  000. 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Sectio n 2 > Article 18  175  
 
The rules in the GA  do not affect national laws on keeping documents  (which may require 
additional measures) . 
 
2. Original documents  
The b eneficiaries must keep original documents . 
The Commission /Agency  will accept any document considered an original under national law.  
Examples:  
1. The Commission will accept authenticated  copies or digitally -signed documents, if national law accepts these 
as originals.  
2. The Commission will accept digitalis ed copies of documents (instead of hard copies) , if this is acceptable 
under national law.  
In principle, documents should be kept in the format in which they were received or created.  
This means that:  
 documents received or created in paper fo rm should be kept in paper form  
 documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format.  
Hard copies of original ele ctronic documents are not required.  
 
3. Records f or actual costs  
For actual costs, the beneficiaries must:  
 keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the costs 
declared  
 use cost accounting practices and internal control procedures that make it possible to 
verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts recorded 
in supporting documentation match up.  
Best practice:  The information included in the financial statements for each budget ca tegory (i.e. 
personnel costs, other direct costs, indirect costs) must be broken down into details and must match 
the amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation.  
Examples:  
1. For costs declared in category A.1  (employees or equivalent ): the costs must be detailed for each person  
carrying out work for the action (individual hourly rate multiplied by the actual hours worked for the action). 
They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial stateme nts) and 
supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour agreements, applicable national law on taxes, 
labour and social security contributions, payslips, time records, bank statements showing salary payments, 
etc.).  
2. For costs declared in category D.1, D.2 , D.3 and D.4 (other direct costs ): the beneficiary must keep a 
breakdown of costs declared by type (i.e. travel costs and related subsistence allowances, depreciation, costs of 
other goods and services etc.) . It should be able  to provide details of individual transactions for each type of 
cost. For depreciation, it must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared 
costs must match accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and 
supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank statements, asset 
usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc.).  
 
 
 Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents will bear the full risk  of cost rejection by the 
Commission/Agency .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  176 4. Records f or unit costs set by the Commission  
For unit costs, the beneficiaries must keep : 
 detailed records  and other supporting documents to prove the number of units declared.  
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred.  
The Commission /Agency  may access the accounting records, but will reject costs  only if the 
number of units declared is incorrect. (The actual costs of the work are not relevant) .  
If the Commission /Agency  detects an irregularity or fraud in the action’s implementation, it may 
reduce the grant.  
 
5. Records f or u nit costs calculated i n accordance with the beneficiary’s usual 
cost accounting practices  
For costs declared in accordance with their  usual cost accounting practices  (average personnel 
costs and costs of internally invoiced goods and services ), the beneficiaries must keep 
detailed records and other supporting documents to:  
 show that the costs used to calculate the unit cost match the actual costs as rec orded in 
the statutory accounts  
Examples:   
1. For personnel costs:  accounting records ; financial statement extracts ; labour contracts ; collective 
labour agreements ; applicable tax, labour and social security laws;  pay slips ; bank statements showing 
salary payments ; classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, 
etc.). 
2. For internally invoiced goods and services: accounting records ; financial statement extracts ; time 
records (or other records) for the share of personnel costs included in the unit costs; invoices or 
contracts for maintenance costs, cleaning costs, other se rvices, showing that the cost are directly 
identifiable . 
Manual interventions into the accounting data must be traceable and documented.  
 verify that the unit cost is fre e of ineligible cost components  
Examples :  
1. For personnel costs: records that show that the hourly rate does not include an indirect cost 
component ( already  covered by the 25  % flat rate); records that show that the hourly rate does not 
include travel costs ( they should be claimed under category D.1 ‘travel ’). 
2. For internally invoiced goods and services: evidence that shows that there is no profit/margin/mark -
up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different rates : one for billing the activity , 
with mark -up, and another one for internal costing , free of any mark -up); lists of accounts/cost centres 
that were excluded from the calculation of internally invoiced goods and services — because  already 
included in the costs claimed under  another budget categor ies (e.g. LRI costs, indirect costs, in-kind 
contribution s, etc. ). 
 assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements  
Example s:  
1. For personnel costs:  records that show the method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g.  
consumer price index which, according to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the 
basis for annual salary increases ). 
2. For internally invoiced goods and services:  traceable data used to determine the budget ed/ estimate d 
elements ; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the budgeted and estimated elements;  
etc. 
 for personnel costs: verify the number of productive hours used to calcul ate the unit cost 
(hourly rate)  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  177  for internally invoiced goods and services: verify that  the cost items used for the 
calculation of the unit cost were directly linked to the production of the invoiced good or 
service.  
Example s (not acceptable) :  
1. Maintenance which goes beyond  than the maintenance of the infrastructure/facilities used to produc e 
the good/service  (e.g. maintenance costs for all the beneficiary’s cleanrooms ; maintenance costs for an 
entire  building , while the cleanroom used for the good/ service occupie s only a part of the building).  
2. Generic supplies for which there is no evidence that they were directly linked to the 
infrastructure/facilities used  to produce the good/service  (e.g. electricity costs when there is no 
electricity counter or technical specifications to measure the consumption).  
By contrast, i t is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred (per person /good or 
service)  — unless they are needed  to document the usual cost accounting practices  (as just 
described) . 
 
6. Certificate on the methodology (CoMUC)  
What?  To get additional assurance,  a beneficiary /linked third part y may request that the 
Commission/Agency confirms that its cost accounting practices  for personnel costs  comply with 
the conditions set out in Article 6.2 .A, by approving a certificate on its methodology (CoMUC).  
Approval concerns the cost accounting practices described and certified in the certificate on 
the methodology.  
If the Commission/Agency approves the CoMUC, it will not challenge the personnel unit co sts 
(hourly rates) declared  — unless information was concealed or fraud or corruption was used to 
obtain approval  (or another methodology was applied) .  
Approval is valid for all personnel costs declared according to these cost accounting practices, 
includ ing costs declared before  the Commission/Agency approval (if the beneficiary can show 
that they were declared according to the  approved practices).   
Best practice:  Beneficiaries  should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting 
documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary).  
Approval is  valid for all H2020 grants (i.e. for the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices) and is not linked or limited to a specific grant.  (It is NOT valid for FP7 grants and, 
conversely an FP7 c ertificate is NOT valid for H2020 .) 
When?  Beneficiaries may in principle submit their  requests for approval at any time  — before or 
during the grant.   
Best practice:  In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to  get assurance  on the 
methodology , it is recommended to request  it only after the first  reporting period  has passed . 
If the beneficiary changes its cost accounting practices , it must obtain a new certificate and 
submit a new request for approval to the Commiss ion/Agency.  
 
 
 
How?  The beneficiary must submit  its certificate on the methodology to the Commission/Agency  
(via the following address : EC-H2020 -UNIT-COST -METHODOLOGY -
CERTIFICATION@ec.europa.eu ). The certificate should be drawn up by an independent auditor  
using the template in Annex 6 of the GA (or an independent public officer, i f the beneficiary  is a 
public body) . 
 
 If the beneficiary declares personnel costs according to the changed cost accounting practices 
before  the new certificate is approved, it bear s the full risk  of non -approval and cost rejection by the 
Commission/Agency .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  178 7. Records f or flat-rate costs  
For flat -rate costs, the beneficiaries must:  
 keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the 
flat rate is applie d are eligible.  
Example:  For the flat rate of 25  % of indirect costs, the auditors will  verify (and the beneficiaries must 
be able to show) that:  
a) the actual direct costs are eligible, using the detailed records and supporting documents 
explained above;  
b) the following costs were excluded: subcontracting costs, the costs of resources made available 
by third parties not used on the beneficiary’s premises and financial support to third parties 
from the pool of actual direct eligible costs to which the flat rate applies.  
It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred.  
 
8. Records f or lump  sum costs  
For lump  sum costs, the beneficiaries must:  
 keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove that the action tasks 
described in Annex 1 have been carried out in accordance with the GA.  
It is NOT necessary to keep rec ords on the actual costs incurred.  
 
9. Records f or personnel costs — Hours worked for the action  
The records for personnel costs depend on whether the person worked exclusively for the action or 
not. 
 
 
 
For persons  who work exclusively for the action  (regardless if they are full-time or part -time 
employees ), the beneficiar y may either:  
 sign a declaration  on exclusive work for the action  [ODT format ] (one per reporting 
period ), to confirm that the person worked exclusively for the action , either : 
 during the whole reporting period   
or 
 during an uninterrupted time -period , covering at least a full calendar month within 
the reporting period .  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should take a prudent approach and use this possibility only if 
it is planned that the person works exclusively on the action during a long and continuous 
period of time. If there are any doubts, a record of actual hours worked should be kept  (e.g. 
time-sheets) . 
‘Exclusive work’ means that the person carried out NO OTHER activities for the beneficiary 
than those of the action.  
Intermittent (i.e. sporadic or random) periods of ‘exclusive’ dedication can NOT be 
subject of a  declaration.  If a person worked randomly for the action after an 
  For H2020, e xclusive work or not matters only for the record -keeping . It has NO impact on the 
calculation of the costs to be declared  (— in both cases they must be calculated through an hourly rate, 
monthly or per full financial year, etc.; see Article 6.2.A ). 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  179 uninterrupted time -period covered by a declaration, time -sheets are needed for the 
period of random work.  
Example:  The person worked for the action exclusively from 15/02 to 31/05 and then worked 
again in  the action some days in July and October and the full month of November. The 
declaration will cover the period from 15/02 to 31/05 and time records must be kept for the 
time the person worked for the action in July, October and November.  
If a person worke d under different regimes during the reporting period (exclusive and 
non-exclusive), the declaration may be used ONLY for a period of exclusive  work. The 
other months must be recorded with  time-sheets .  
If there were several periods of exclusive work durin g one reporting period, the 
beneficiary may choose to use the declaration for the longest one (and use the monthly 
time-sheets for the others ).  
The declaration must be dated  and signed  by the person concerned  AND her/his 
supervisor .  
 keep time records .  
Best practice: If the person works exclusively for the action during a full financial year , it is 
strongly recommended that the beneficiary  signs the ‘declaration on exclusive work for the 
action’  (— even if the person  keeps time records) . In this way , the declaration can serve as 
evidence that  the person worked for the action all her/his annual productive hours.  
For persons  who do NOT work exclusively for the action , the beneficiar ies must:  
 show the actual hours worked, with reliable time records  (i.e. time-sheets ) either on 
paper or in a computer -based time recording system.   
Time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for the 
action and his/her supervisor.  
If the time  recording system is computer -based, the signatures m ay be electronic (i.e. 
linking the electronic identity data (e.g. a password and user name)  to the electronic  
validation  data, with a documented  and secure process for managing user rights and an 
auditable log of all electronic transactions ). 
Time records should include , as a minimum : 
 the title and number of the action, as specified in the GA  
 the beneficiary’s full name, as specified  in the GA  
 the full name, date and signature of the person working for  the action  
 the number of hours worked for the action in  the period cov ered by the time record   
 the supervisor’s full name and signature  
 a reference to the action tasks or work packages of Annex 1, to which the person 
has contributed by the reported working hours.   
Information included in time -sheets must matc h records of annual  leave,  sick leave , 
other leaves  and work -related travel.  
A template  [ODT format ] for time -sheets with these minimum requirements is 
available . (This template is not mandatory ; beneficiaries may use their own mod el, 
provided that it fulfils the minimum conditions and it contains at least the information 
detailed above .)  
If time records are not reliable, the Commission/A gency may exceptionally accept alternative 
evidence  if it proves the number of hours worked on the action with a similar (or at least 
satisfactory) level of assurance (assessed against generally -accepted audit standards).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  180  
 
 
Examples  of possible alternative evidence (non -exhaustive list): travel documents proving 
participation in a project meeting (boarding pass, obliterated travel ticket, hotel invoice, etc.); agenda and 
minutes of the meeting; attendance lists; working papers; laboratory log books; professional/personal 
diaries; documents related to presentations; scientific publications; correspondence such as letters, notes, 
memos, emails; etc.   
The auditor s will use the following three criteria to assess how credible the alternative 
evidence is:  
1. Clear identification of the person concerned  
2. Clear link to the project under scrutiny  
3. Possibility to quantify time spent on project -related tasks.  
Alternative eviden ce will only be accepted if these three criteria are met.  
Example (acceptable alternative evidence ): 
A researcher submits the following email as alternative evidence: ‘I hereby send you the results of the 
analysis of project XYZ that I have been working on for the last two weeks.’  
Criterion 1 is met – the sender of the email is the person concerned  
Criterion 2 is met – the project is identified as XYZ  
Criterion 3 is met – the time is quantified: two weeks  
Example (not acceptable alternative evidence ): 
A beneficiary submits the following email as alternative evidence: ‘I hereby send you the results of the 
analysis recently carried out by my team.’  
Criterion 1 is not met – it is unclear who the person concerned is; the team members and their 
contributions ar e unknown  
Criterion 2 is not met: the project name is not mentioned  
Criterion 3 is not met – the time is not quantified  
 
10. Records of (linked) third parties  
The b eneficiaries must ensure that linked third parties  comply with the same obligations in 
terms of keeping appropriate and sufficient evidence.  
Example:  Linked third parties that carry out work themselves must document all their costs in the same way 
the beneficiaries do. However, it is the beneficiary who m ust keep the original financial statements and the 
certificates on financial statements of the linked third parties.  
The b eneficiaries must also ensure that they keep appropriate and sufficient evidence related to 
third parties that made in -kind contributi ons and to subcontractors . 
Examples:  
1. The b eneficiaries must keep evidence of third parties’ actual direct costs if there are in -kind contributions, 
either free of charge or against payment. Alternatively, they may ensure that the third parties keep the 
evidence.  
2. The b eneficiaries must keep evidence showing that subcontractors fulfilled their obligations in terms of the 
visibility of EU funding. Alternatively, they may ensure that the subcontractors keep this evidence.  
For international partners , beneficiaries must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence  ONLY on 
scientific and technical implementation of the action. Beneficiaries are not required to prove the 
costs of the international partners, since the latter do not receive EU funding ( see Article 14a ).     
Specific case (records of linked third parties):  
Financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS)  — It is the beneficiary 
that must keep the originals of the financial statements and the certificates on the financial statements 
of the linked third parties.  
  The Commission/Agency has full discretion  to accept or refuse the alternative evidence and there is 
no entitlement to it. Beneficiaries that rely on alternative evidence bear the full risk  of refusal and 
rejection of co sts by the Commission/Agency .

ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Deliverables  
What & When? The coordinator  must submit the deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance 
with the timing and conditions set out in that Annex.  
‘Deliverables’ are additional outputs (e.g. information, special report, a technical diagram  
brochure, list, a software milestone or other building block of the action ) that must be 
produced at a given moment during the action (normally not at the same tim e as the 
periodic/final reports).  
‘Milestones’ are, by contrast, control points in the action  that help to chart progress. They may 
correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the  work to 
begin or be needed at intermediary points . 
The deliverables that must be produced are listed in Annex 1 of the GA.  
Example:  For actions under Part III, ‘Secure, clean and efficient e nergy ’ involving energy efficiency measures  in 
buildings , the beneficiaries must deliver a ‘handover certificate’ at the same time as their periodic reports.  This 
certificate must prove the actual specifications of the buildings constructed or refurbished, their surface area and 
address. It must be signed by a member  of the consortium.  
For deliverables that are not in writing (e.g. cell line or prototype) , the beneficiaries must submit a 
short written description.  
How?  The coordinator must upload  them directly in the  Funding & Tenders Portal .  
 
 
 ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
19.1 Obligation to submit deliverables  
The coordinator must submit the ‘deliverables ’ identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and 
conditions set out in it.  
19.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the  [Commission] [Agency]  may apply 
any of the measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
 Security obligations — If the deliverables contain EU classified  information , the coordinator must first 
contact the Commission/Agency to discuss how to submit them ( approval needed;  see Article 37 ).  
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classifi ed information in EU 
research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .

Annex 2).  
The beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  must declare all eligible costs, even if — for 
actual costs, unit costs and  flat-rate costs  — they exceed the amounts indicated in the 
estimated budget (see Annex 2). Amounts which are not declared in the individual 
financial statement will not be taken into account by the [Commission][Agency] . 
If an individual financial statement is not submitted  for a reporting period, it may be 
included in the periodic financial report for the next reporting period.  
The individual financial statements of the last reporting period must also detail the 
receipts of the action  (see Article 5.3.3).  
Each beneficiary [and each linked third party]  must certify  that:

each beneficiary [and for each linked third party] , if it requests a total contribution  of EUR 
325  000 or more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the basis of 
its usual cost accounting practices (see Article 5.2  and Article 6.2) . 
20.5 Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
[OPTION 1 for grants above EUR 5 million with reporting periods beyond 18 months39: In addition to the 
reporting requirements set out above (Article 20.1 to 20.3), the coordinator must inform the 
[Commission] [Agency]  by [31 December][30 November] each year of the cumulative expenditure incurred 
by the beneficiaries fro m the starting date of the action.  
This information is required for the Commission ’s accounting purposes and will not be used to calculate the 
final grant amount. ] 
[OPTION 2 :  Not applicable ] 
20.6 Currency for financial statements and conversion into  euro  
Financial statements must be drafted in euro.  
Beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  with accounting established in a currency other than the euro must 
convert the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates pub lished in 
the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union , calculated over the corresponding reporting 
period.  
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal of the European Union  for the currency in 
question, they must be c onverted at the average of the monthly accounting rates published on the 
Commission’s website, calculated over the corresponding reporting period.  
Beneficiaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in euro must convert costs incurred in 
another currency into euro according to their usual accounting practices.  
20.7 Language of reports  
All reports (technical and financial reports, including financial statements) must be submitted in the 
language of the Agreement.  
20.8 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the reports submitted do not comply with this Article, the [Commission] [Agency]  may suspend the 
payment deadline (see Article 47 ) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
If the coordinator breaches its obligation to submit the reports and if it fails to comply with this obligation 
within 30 days following a written reminder the [Commission] [Agency]  may terminate the Agreement  (see 
Article 50 ) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
39 To be added in the case of grants of more than EUR 5 million for which a pre -financing is paid and the reporting periods for interim 
payments or payments of the balance exceed eighteen months.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  185 
 
1. Reports  
What  & When ? In order to receive payments, the beneficiaries (and their linked third parties) 
must report on the (technical and financial) implementation of the action (reporting).  
 
 
 
The coordinator must submit  a periodic report  after the end of each reporting period ( including 
the final one) . 
Each report should be seen as a single package, composed of several parts, i.e.:   
 a technical report  
The periodic technical report includes an expl anation of work carried out, an overview of 
progress, a publishable summary and a questionnaire.  
The final technical report is a publishable summary of the entire action (describing the 
overview of the results and their exploitation and dissemination, the conclusions on the 
action and its socio -economic impact).  
 a financial report . 
The periodic financial report includes the individual financial statements, an explanation of 
the use of resources and the periodic summary financial statement.  
The final financi al report consists of the final summary financial statement that is 
automatically generated by the IT system. In some cases (and for some 
beneficiaries/linked third parties) it must be accompanied by a certificate on the financial 
statements ( CFS; one cert ificate per beneficiary/linked third party).  
The financial reports also contain the requests for payment (necessary for any payment 
other than the pre -financing payment).  
Costs related to reporting may be eligible ( see Article 6.2.D.3 ). 
If the coordinator breaches its obligation  to submit the reports, the Commission/Agency may 
suspend the payment deadline and — if not remedied after a written reminder — terminate the GA 
or take any of the other Chapter 6 measures (e.g. cost rejection, grant reduction, recovery of 
payments already made, etc. ; see Articles 42 -44, 47-50). 
The GA will not be terminated if  the breach concerns the last reporting period (because the 
action duration is already over ). 
How?  The report (s) must be prepared  by the coordinator  and the  other  beneficiaries  
together  (directly  in the  Funding & Tenders  Portal Continuous and Periodic Reporting Modules ). 
List of documents  for the periodic reports : 
 explanation of the work carried out  (periodic reporting - part B technical report)  
 overview of the progress  (periodic reporting - part B technical report)  
 updated plan for the exploitation and  dissemination of results (if necessary)  (periodic 
reporting - part B technical report)  
 summary for publication  (continuous reporting)  
 answers to the questionnaire ( continuous reporting ) 
 These reports must be distinguished from deliverables  (that are part of Annex 1 ; see Article 19 ) and 
milestones (part of Annex 1 , but not covered by Article 19 or 20). 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  186  individual financial statements for each beneficiary and linked party  (periodic reporting - 
financial report)  
 explanation o f the use of resources  (periodic reporting - financial report)  
 summary financial statement (generated automatically by the IT system)  
 information on amounts to be paid to the Joint Research Centre (JRC)  (if necessary).  
List of documents for the final report : 
 final summary for publication (generated automatically by the IT system ) 
 final summary financial statement (generated automatically by the IT system)  
 certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (i f necessary) . 
Generally, the y can be prepared together  (i.e. by several users from different beneficiaries) , 
via the Funding & Tenders  Portal Continuous and Periodic Reporting Modules . The parts in the 
continuous reporting  can be filled out at any moment in time ( continuously open ) and are 
then automatically added into the periodic report by the IT system  (part A of the technical 
report with the questionnaire  and  the  summary  for publication; consolidated financial 
statemen t). Other parts are opened only at periodic reporting  (part B of the technical report, 
individual financial statements, explanation of the use of resources) .  Data is cross -linked to 
avoid duplication of data input (e.g. the financial statement and the exp lanation on the use of 
resources  are linked : for each cost declared in the financial statement, a box will pop up 
asking the beneficiary to give an explanation of the cost, link it to the relevant work 
package(s) and justify the expense , if necessary ; the final report is completely automatized: 
assembled on the basis of elements from the periodic report).  
Individual financial statements  must be filled out by each beneficiary (individually), 
and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator ( directly  in the Funding & 
Tenders Portal ).  
This includes the coordinator , who must also submit the individual financial statement  
for itself .  
For linked third parties , the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by 
their beneficiary  (since t he linked third parties  cannot sign them in the IT system ).  
Before submission, the beneficiary must complete  the data for the linked t hird 
party (based on the information it received  from the linked third party ). The 
beneficiary then  prints the financial statement and sends it to the linked third 
party, for signature  (on paper ) and return  (by registered post with proof of 
delivery ). The beneficiary must ensu re that the data  encoded is correct (i.e. 
identical to the signed paper version).  
 
 
 
If a beneficiary cannot submit its individual financial statement on time, the report can 
be submitted without this financial statement . The costs will be considered zero 
for this reporting period, but the beneficiary can declare its costs with the  next financial 
report (for the next reporting period) .  
The coordinator will be asked to confirm the non -submission, when submitting the 
report.  
If a beneficiary fails to submit its financial statement for the last reporting period, the 
Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline (see Article 47 ). 
The certificates on the financial statements ( CFS) must be submitted (by the 
coordinator) as scanned copy (PDF) together with  the financial statement for the last 
reporting period of the beneficiary concerned.  
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its 
files (see Article 18.1.2 ).

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  187  
 
 
When all parts are ready, the report(s) are assembled automatically by the IT system and must be 
submitted  by the coordinator  (as a single package; single submission ).  
When a report is submitted, the  other beneficiaries are automatically informed by the system.  
If the Commission/Agency considers the report incomplete  or not in compliance with the 
conditions of this Article, it will suspend the payment deadline (see Article  47). 
In this case, the Commission/Agency will send back the report to the coordinator, as a 
single package, together with a notification letter that explains the reasons and requests 
modifications a nd/or clarification(s) ( suspension  of the payment deadlin e). The 
coordinator (CoCo) must then re -submit the corrected report, as a single package, within 
the deadline specified ( single re -submission ). 
The re -submission re -starts the payment deadline (remaining time, taking account of 
the time used before suspens ion).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Reporting periods  
Each action is divided into reporting periods.  
The length of the reporting periods is set out in the GA. As a general rule, reporting periods last 
18 months.  
The number of reporting periods is also set out in the GA, and depends on the action duration. 
Normally  it is determined as follows:  
 
Duration in 
months  Max. number of 
periods  
1 to 18  1 
19 to 36  2 
37 to 54  3 
55 to 72  4 
73 to 90  5 
 
 
  Adjustments of financial statements  (exceptional) — If the beneficiaries notice a mistake  
(e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation; etc), they can make an adjustment 
(positive or negative) in the following reporting period to the financial statements for any previous 
reporting period.  
Example:  An internal audit on the annual accounts of the beneficiary finds later errors in the accounting 
information  used to calculate the hourly rates.   
Otherwise , costs that have already been declared can normally NOT be adjusted/changed (e.g. to take 
into account of a different  hourly rate after the closure of the financial year) .  
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original s for itself and its linked third parties 
in its files  (see Article 18.1.2 ).

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  188  
3. Technical report:  Explanation of the work carried out — Overview of the 
progress — Summary for publication — Questionnaire  
The explanation of the work carried  out and the overview of the progress should show  how 
the action is being implemented and what has already been achieved (as compared to the 
objectives, milestones and deliverables described in Annex 1).  
The coordinator must check if all deliverables due for the period have been submitted. If work 
planned was not carried out, the beneficiaries  must explain why.  
The overview of the progress must also describe how achieved r esults are exploited and 
disseminated and include an updated plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the 
results  (if such a plan is foreseen in Annex 1 ). 
For grants signed after GA version 3.0, the overview of the progress must also indicate the 
communication activities ca rried out by the consortium (see also Article 38.1 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The summary  must give a brief description of the action, presenting its objectives a nd the results 
achieved (in an easy -to-read way, understandable for a non -specialist audience).  
The summary must be fit for publication , so that the Commission /Agency can publish it on 
its website right away . 
If needed, the Commission/Agency may make changes to the summary and publish it 
(after having given the coordinator the opportunity to comment).  
The coordinator must ensure that none of the material submitted for publication include s 
confidential (or EU-classified)  information.  
For the last reporting period:  The summary should present an overview of the results, their 
exploitation and dissemination, the action’s conclusions and its socio -economic impact 
(because it  will be directly re -used for the final report).  
The questionnaire  must be filled out to provide the Commission/Agency with regular up -to-date 
information for monitoring the action (and ultimately the H2020 Programme).  
The questionnaire consists in structu red information on : 
 performance indicators (defined in Annex II to the H2020 Specific Programme)  
 information to monitor the implementation of H2020 on cross –cutting issues (see 
Annex III to the Specific Programme)  and to assess the progress of Horizon 2020 
against the objectives defined for the ‘societal challenges ’ (see Article 3  and Annex  
I to the Specific Programme) . 
It is designed in a modular way, consisting as much as possible of structured questions, by topic 
(e.g. publications, patents, innovation, etc.) . 
 
 
 Security obligations — Technical reports may NOT  contain any information that has been  EU-
classified  in Annex 1 of the GA (see Article 37 ). 
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classified 
information in EU research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  189 4. Financial report: Individual financial statements — Explanation of the use of 
resource s — Summary financial statement  — Certificates on the financial 
statements (CFS)  
The individual financial statements  (see Annex 4) must contain all costs that:  
 were incurred by the beneficiary/linked third parties during the reporting period  
AND 
 fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6 . 
 
 
 
 
Beneficiaries may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period, if they were not 
declared before . 
The costs of linked third parties must NOT be included in the beneficiary’s financial 
statements ; linked third parties must fill out their own financial statements.  
For the last reporting period, beneficiaries also have to declare the receipts for the action (see 
Article 5.3.3 ). 
 Beneficiaries/linked third parties should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if they are above th e 
estimated budget in Annex 2 ( cost overruns ). The grant will be capped at the maximum grant amount, but 
cost overruns  may turn out useful, if the Commission/Agency should reject some of the costs (at payment or 
later on). 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Combining different  EU grants  — Beneficiaries that have action grants and operating grants 
may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they are  able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. 
that the ir operating grant s do not cover any costs which are covered by  their action  grants ). 
To demonstrate cost separation , the following conditions must be fulfilled:  
 the operating grant s may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it may not 
be full operating grant s)  
 the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting management 
with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must app ly these keys and codes to 
identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either the action grant  activities  or the 
operating grant  activities )   
 the beneficiary must record:  
 all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating grant s (i.e. 
personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked to the WP) and  
 all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their action grant s 
(including the indirect costs linked to the action)  
 the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and realistic 
result.  
Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions  must EITHER:  
 not sign/ terminate the operating grant s, in order to be able to claim  indirect costs  in the action 
grants  
 keep the operating grant s, but sign the action grant s without  indirect costs  or request no 
indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre -filled amount in the indirect cost column of 
the financial statement) . 
The possibility to  combine operating grants with action grants if costs are separated was introduced 
with GA version 4.0. It applies also to older grant agreements, if the beneficiaries can demonstrate that 
there is no double funding, in accordance with the above -listed pri nciples (analytical accounting tools, 
full cost recording, fair allocation).  
Best practice:  In case of overlapping EU action and operating grant s, the beneficiary should immediately 
contact the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal ). Be aware that operating grants are not 
always easy to identify. They exist under various labels  (operating grants; financial contributions/support to 
the functioning/operation of entities; etc.). Check your call text.  
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  190 The explanation of the use of resources  must be consistent with the costs declared in the 
financial statement per beneficiary.  
For the final reporting period, s ome beneficiaries/linked third parties will also have to submit a 
certificate on the financial statement  (CFS) . 
Such a certificate is needed if the beneficiary/linked third party requests a total financial 
contribution of EUR 325  000 (or more) as reimbursement for actual  costs and unit costs 
calculated according to its usual accounting practices (average personnel costs and costs for 
internally invoiced goods and services).  
This means that costs based on lump sums, flat -rates ( e.g. indirect costs ) or unit costs 
(other than those for personnel costs and costs for internally invoiced goods and services 
calculated according to the beneficia ry’s usual cost accounting practices) are NOT counted 
for the EUR 325 000 threshold (and do not need to be covered by the certificate).  
Example:  
A is a beneficiary in an action which declared the following total eligible costs for the action:  
 personnel costs according to  usual accounting practices   =  EUR 250  000 
 subcontracting costs       =  EUR 40  000 
 depreciation costs of equipment used to carry out the action  =  EUR 60  000 
 indirect costs (25  % flat rate)      =  EUR 77  500 
 total eligible c osts claimed by A     =  EUR 427  500 
The reimbursement rate is 100%.  
As the amount of eligible actual costs and personnel costs according to usual accounting practices 
incurred by A (and hence the requested financial contribution) is higher than EUR 325  000, A must 
submit a CFS for the following costs:  
Type of cost  Direct 
personnel 
costs Subcontracting 
costs Other direct 
costs Indirect costs  Total costs 
covered by the 
CFS 
Costs 
covered by 
the CFS  250  000 40 000 60 000 0 350  000 
 
If a certificate is required, all costs declared as actual costs or unit costs calculated 
according to usual accounting practices must be covered by the certificate. Incomplete 
certificates will be returned for correction.  
However, costs previously audite d by the Commission/Agency are NOT counted for the 
EUR 325 000 threshold and they do not need to be covered (again) by the certificate).  
Linked third parties must submit a certificate if it reaches (on its own, without its 
beneficiary) the EUR 325  000 threshold.  
Certificates submitted before the EUR 325  000 threshold is reached will be rejected by the 
Commission/Agency.  
Beneficiaries/linked third parties may submit either one certificate per reporting period  or 
a single CFS for the whole action .  
The certificate(s) may be submitted ONLY with the final financial report . Certificates 
submitted at any other moment will NOT be accepted (and costs incurred for them will be 
considered ineligible, because not necessary).  
 
Costs for partial certificates ( i.e. one certificate per reporting period) will be accepted ONLY 
in the last reporting period and ONLY if:  
 a CFS is mandatory (i.e. the threshold is reached at the end of the action) and  
 the total costs of the partial certificates is similar to the cost th at would have been 
incurred for a single certificate.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  191 The certificate must be issued by an external auditor , using the template in Annex 5 of the 
GA.  
Only qualified auditors may issue a certificate.  
‘Qualified’ means qualified in accordance with national legislation implementing 
Directive 2006/43/EC44 (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive).  
The auditor must certify that the costs declared in  the financial statement are accurately 
recorded in  the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible.  
If the auditor cannot confirm (for any reason), s/he must explain this in detail in the 
certificate. The Commission/Agency will consider the explanation i n light of the facts 
provided by the auditor, and decide on steps to take.  
The summary financial statement  is generated automatically by the IT system ( with 
consolidat ed data from all individual financial statements for all beneficiaries and linked third 
parties, for the reporting period).  
For the final reporting period, the IT system  will also generate a  final summary financial 
statement  (consolidating the data from all individual financial statements for all beneficiaries and 
linked third parties, for all reporting periods).  
 
Specific cases (certificates on the financial statements):  
Public bodies — For public bodies, the certificate may be issued by an  independent public officer with 
formal competence to audit the beneficiary/linked third party (instead of by an external auditor).  
International organisations  — For international organisations, it can be an internal or external 
auditor that is appointed i n accordance with the internal financial regulations and procedures of the 
organisation.  
Beneficiaries/linked third parties from a third country  — Beneficiaries/linked third parties 
established in a non-EU country must provide  a certificate that complies w ith national regulations in the 
field. Auditors qualified in the EU may provide certificates for beneficiaries established in non-EU 
countries, if they are familiar with the relevant national regulations (national accounting rules) and 
comply with them whe n preparing the certification.  
 
5. Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
This option will be inserted in the GA for grants above  EUR 5 million, for which pre -financing is 
paid and where the reporting period for interim payments or payment of the b alance exceeds 18 
months.  
A template  is available and must be submitted via the Funding & Tenders  Portal Continuous 
Reporting Module . 
 
6. Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro  
Beneficiaries (and linked third parties ) must always use euros, to report costs in their financial 
statements.  
The rules on conversion (of costs incurred in other currencies into euros) are as foll ows: 
                                            
44  Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Cou ncil Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and 
repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 87).

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2  > Article 20  192  for beneficiaries/linked third parties with accounting records in euros : conversion of 
costs according to their usual accounting practices  
 for beneficiaries/linked third parties with accounting records in a currency other than 
the euro : conversion of costs recorded in their accounts by one of the following:  
 daily euro exchange rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal  of the 
European Union  for the currency in question:  using the average of the daily 
exchange rates published over the corresponding reporting period.  
For cost adjustments to previous periods  (‘adjustment financial statements’) , the 
exchange rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which  the costs 
adjusted were incurred.  
For eligibile cost related to draftin g and submitting the final report s incurred after 
the action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting 
period.  
To calculate this rate, the beneficiaries  may use the editable charts on the  
ECB website45.  
How to  calculat e the rate  on the ECB website : 
Step 1 —  Go to the ECB website . 
Step 2 —  Click on the chart icon [
  ] for the currency.  
Step 3 —  Choose the ‘HTML5 version ’ which appears under the name of the 
currency in the top -left corner.  
Step 4 —  Insert  the start ing date of the reporting period in the field ‘from’ and the 
end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The average for the 
period will appear above the chart. 
Example: A Romanian university with accounting in New Romanian Leu (RON) is the 
beneficiary of a GA with one reporting period, from 24.1.2013 to 23.1.2014. The costs 
incurred in RON during this period are RON 500  000. The university will convert its costs into 
euros at the average rate of RON 4  .4274 for EUR 1 (established following the steps mentioned 
above). The university will repor t costs of EUR 112  933, 10 (RON 500  000 / RON 4  .4274 * EUR 
1). 
 if NO daily euro exchange rate is published : using the average of the monthly 
accounting rates over the corresponding reporting period , using the currency 
converter  on the Commission’s website46. 
Example:  A Moldovan university with accounting in Moldovan Lei (MDL) is the beneficiary of a GA 
with one reporting period, from 24.01.2013 to 23.01.201 4. The costs incurred in MDL during this 
period are MDL 500  000. The university will calculate the average of the 13 monthly exchange 
rates (January 2013 until January 2014)  published on the Commission’s website. This average rate 
is MDL 16 ,.7531 for EUR 1 . The university will report costs of EUR 29   845,22 (MDL 500  000 / MDL 
16,.7531 * EUR 1).  
 
7. Language of reports  
The reports must be drafted in the language of the GA (indicated at the end of the GA, next to the 
signatures of the parties).

 ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments to be made   
The following payments will be made to the coordinator:  
- one pre-financing payment;  
- one or more interim payments , on the basis of the request(s) for interim payment (see Article 20 ), 
and 
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
20). 
21.2 Pre-financing payment — Amount  — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The amount of the pre -financing payment w ill be EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ].  
The [Commission][Agency]  will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre -financing payment to the 
coordinator within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see  Article 58 ) or from 10 
days before the starting date of the action (see  Article 3 ), whichever is the latest.  
An amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 5% of the maxi mum grant 
amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the [Commission] [Agency]  from the pre -financing payment and 
transferred into the ‘ Guarantee Fund ’ 
[OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary:  Moreover, the part of the pre -financing payment related to the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) ([ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ] is not paid to the coordinator, but kept 
by the [ Commission][Agency] for the JRC.] 
21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs incurred for the implementation of the action during the 
corresponding reporting periods.  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will pay to the coordinator the amount due as interim payment  within 90 days 
from receiving the periodic report (see  Article 20.3), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, aut henticity, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as interim payment  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates  
Step 2 — Limit to  90 % of the maximum grant amount  
21.3.1  Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates  
The reimbursement rate(s) (see  Article 5.2 ) are applied to the eligible costs ( actual costs, unit costs and 
flat-rate costs [and lump sum costs] ; see Article 6 ) declared by the beneficiaries [and the linked third 
parties]  (see Article 20 ) and approved by the [Commission][Agency]  (see above) for the concerned 
reporting period.

 21.3.2  Step 2 — Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount  
The total amount of pre -financing and interim payments must not exceed 90% of the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1. The maximum amount for the interim payment will be calculated as follows:  
{90% of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1)  
minus 
{pre-financing and previous interim payments} }. 
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the 
beneficiaries for the implementation of the action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the paymen t 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see  Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the [Commission] [Agency]  
will pay the balance within 90 days  from  receiving the final report (see  Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 
or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the final report.  Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  by deducting the total 
amount of pre -financing and interim payment s (if any) already made, from the final grant amount 
determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
{pre-financing and interim payments (if any) made} }. 
At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guar antee Fund (see above) will be released 
and: 
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the coordinator together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recover y): it will be 
deducted from the amount released (see  Article 44.1.2 ). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator  
- is negative, it will be recovered.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiaries’ consent —  against any other 
amount owed by a beneficiary to the [Agency, the]  Commission or an [other]  executive agency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum EU contribu tion indicated, for that beneficiary, in the 
estimated budget (see Annex 2).

 21.5 Notification of amounts due  
When making payments, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify to the coordinator the amount 
due, specifying whether it concerns an interim payment or the payment of the balance.  
For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.  
In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.  
21.6 Currency for payments  
The [Commission][Agency]  will make all payments in euro.  
21.7 Payments to the coordinat or — Distribution to the beneficiaries   
Payments will be made to the coordinator.  
Payments to the coordinator will discharge the [Commission][Agency]  from its payment obligation.  
The coordinator must distribute the payments between the beneficiaries wit hout unjustified delay.  
Pre-financing may however be distributed only:  
(a) if the minimum number of beneficiaries set out in the call for proposals has acceded to the 
Agreement (see  Article 56 ) and  
(b) to beneficiaries that have acceded to the Agreement (see  Article 56 ). 
21.8 Bank account for payments  
All payments will be made to the following bank account:  
Name of bank: [ …]  
Full name of the account holder: [ …]  
Full account number (including bank codes): [ …]  
[IBAN code: [ …]]40 
21.9 Costs of payment transfers  
The cost of the payment transfers is borne as follows:  
- the [Commission] [Agency]  bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank;  
- the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank;  
- the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer.  
21.10  Date of payment  
Payments by the [Commission][Agency]  are considered to have been carried out on the date when they are 
debited to its account.

1. Payments  to be made   
The Commission/Agency will make the following payments to the coordinator:  
 a pre-financing payment  at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries with 
cash to start working on the project and continue until the first interim payment)  
Pre-financing will NOT be paid before:  
 the GA is  signed (even if the action starts before ) 
 10 days before the action starting date . 
Example: 
A GA is signed by the coordinator on 30 December 2014 and by the Commission on 5 January 2015. 
The action starting date  would normally be 1 February 2015, but the consortium has requested a fixed 
starting date of 1 September 2014 in its proposal, as the action is a continuation of a previous FP7 
project.  
After due consideration, the fixed start ing date is approved. The pre -financing must be paid by 5 
February 2015 (i.e.  30 days from the entry into force of the GA).  
 interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as many 
interim payments as number of reporting periods)  
 the payment of the balance  after the end of the action.  
 21.11  Consequences of non -compliance  
21.11.1 If the [Commission] [Agency]  does not pay within the payment deadlines (see above) , the 
beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest  at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) 
for its main refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus three and a half points. The reference 
rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expir es, as published in 
the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union .  
If the late -payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR  200, it will be paid to the coordinator only upon 
request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment.  
Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local 
government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this 
Agreement).  
Suspension of the payment deadlin e or payments (see  Articles 47 and 48) will not be considered as late 
payment.  
Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see 
above), up to and including the date of payment.  
Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount.  
21.11.2 I f the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  
Article 43 ) and the Agreement or the participation of the coordinator may be terminated (see  Artic le 50 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
40 BIC or SWIFT code applies to for countries if the IBAN code does not apply.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  197  
 
 
All payments are subject to a payment deadline  (i.e. number of days within which the 
Commission/Agency has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request). 
The deadline depends on the type of payment:  
 for pre -financing:  30 days  
 for interim payments and payment of the balance: 90 days (see Article 21 ). 
If there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it 
impossible to comply with the payment deadline, the Commission/Agency will suspend 
the deadline  (see Article 47 ). 
The pre -financing payment is automatic, while for interim and final payments the 
Commission/Agency must first:  
 analyse the technical reports and financial statements  
 check the eligibility of the claimed costs  
 calculate the amount to be paid  
 approve the payment request and authorise the payment.  
This is not an in -depth verification and therefore no guarantee for eligibility or correctness. 
The costs may still have to be rejected later on, if the Commission/Agency finds — in a 
more i n-depth verification — that they are ineligible.  
The payments are made to the coordinator ; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually.  
The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries — without delay (see 
Article 21.7 ).  
How and when the payments are distributed is in principle an internal matter for the 
consortium.  
The consortium agreement may set out, for instance, specific periods for the distribution of 
payments or that the distribution will be c arried out in instalments (and these will not be 
considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements set out in the consortium agreement 
are complied with).  
Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding which is 
differe nt from the costs claimed.  
Also, i f the coordinator does  NOT comply with its obligations , this is in principle an issue to 
be resolved within the consortium. It is only if the coordinator is terminated that the 
Commission/Agency (and especially the Guarantee Fund ) will intervene ; see Article 50 ).  
The Commission/Agency will be informed of the distribution of the payments by the coordinator:  
 if it specifically requests this  
 in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 44 )  
 if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 50 ). 
The Commission/Agency will notify  the coordin ator of the amount due, explaining which costs 
have been accepted and which have been rejected (if applicable ; see Articles 42 , 43 and 44). 
 Any payment (i.e. pre -financing, interim payments and payment of the balance) may be offset  against 
debts of the beneficiaries towards the Commission/Agency  or an(other) executive agency  — without the 
consen t of the beneficiary concerned and up to the beneficiary’s  maximum grant amount  in Annex 2  (see 
also Article 44 ).

H2020 > Chapter  4 > Section 2 > Article 21  198 The shares f or the Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC)  will always be kept back  and not 
be paid out to the coordinator  (the JRC is a Commission DG and the amounts are therefore cleared 
internally) .  
Example:  
Four beneficiaries: A, B, C and JRC, with a maximum gra nt amount of EUR 1 000 000.  
Estimated budget by beneficiary (Annex 2): A: EUR 300 000; B: EUR 250 000; C: EUR 300 000; JRC: EUR 
150 000  
Pre-financing: EUR 400 000, of which EUR 50 000 (5% of maximum grant amount) is kept for the Guarantee 
Fund and EUR 350  000 transferred to the consortium.  
JRC share of grant: 15  % (150000/1 000 000)  
JRC share of pre -financing (kept by the Commission/Agency): 15  % of 350  000 = EUR 52 500  
Pre-financing payment to coordinator for beneficiaries A, B, C: EUR 350 000 - EUR 52 500 = EUR 297 500  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
Pre-financing payment  
How much?  The pre-financing amount does not depend on any financial statement. It is a float 
that is fixed in each GA  and automatically paid at the beginning of the action .  
How to  calculat e the pre -financing payment : 
Step 1 —  Pre-financing  amount  
The amount of pre -financing is fixed in the GA.  
There is no standard amount (or percentage ) for the pre -financing payment.  For H2020 
grants, it will  normally  be (depending on the availability of EU budget credits) 100  % of 
the average EU funding per reporting period  (i.e. maximum grant amount set out in 
Article 5.1  / number of periods). For actions with only one reporting period,  it will 
however be less, since 100  % would mean the totality of the grant amount.  
Step 2 —  Deduction of the  Guarantee Fund contribution  
At the moment of the pre -financing, an amount that corresponds to  5 % of the 
maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1 ) is deducted from the pre -financing payment 
and transferred to the Guarantee Fund. (The Guarantee Fund is a Fund that covers 
defaulting beneficiaries).  
Step 3 —  Pre-financing  payment letter  
The Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator about the amount due (pre -
financing payment letter).   
Pre-financing funds remain EU property until the payment of the balance — when they are 
cleared against the eligible costs accepted by the Commission/Ag ency.  
 
Example for calculating the pre-financing  payment : 
Action with 3 reporting periods of 18 months.  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 1  000  000.  
Reimbursement rate: 100  %. 
Guarantee Fund contribution: 5% of EUR 1 000 000 =  EUR 50 000.  
Pre-financing amount & deduction of Guarantee Fund contribution : 
Pre-financing  amount : EUR 333 334 . 
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as pre -financing:  EUR 333 334 - EUR 50 000 = EUR 283 334 . 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  199 Payment at b eneficiary  termination  
How much?  The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated by the 
Commission/Agency on the basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the 
report on the distribution of payments  (see also Article s 44.1.1, 50.2.2  and 50.3.3 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to calculate the amount due at beneficiary termination:  
Amount due   
Step 1 —  Calculation of the accepted EU contribution (application of the reimbursement 
rate to the eligible costs)  
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution  for the beneficiary 
concerned , the Commission/Agency will calculate the accepted costs for the beneficiary 
and each of its linked third parties (i.e.  eligible/not rejected costs declared in the interim 
and termination report s; see Articles 6  and 42), apply the reimbursement rate(s) and 
sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary . 
Only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a) ) by the beneficiary concerned until termination 
takes effect are eligible  (except for costs for the termination report) . Costs relating to 
contracts due for execution (i.e. delivery) only after termination are NOT eligible.  
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 30 days of the date 
on which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic 
financial report will NOT be taken into a ccount when the contribution is calculated. The 
Commission/Agency will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.  
If the beneficiary  requested less than the maximum EU contribution, the accepted EU 
contribution will be this lower request ed amount.  
 Amount resulting from Step 1.  
Step 2 —  Grant reductions (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations) , if any   
In order to calculate the amount of grant reductions, the Commission/Agency will 
calculate the grant reductions for the beneficiary concerned and its linked third parties 
(if any; see Article 43 ) and then sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary.  
This total amount of grant reductions is then deducted from the pro rata temporis part 
of the beneficiary’s and linked third parties’  maximum grant amounts ( Annex 2)  — pro 
rata temporis correspond ing to their period of participation (i.e. until termin ation).  
 
 
 
 Amount resulting from Step 2.  
The amount due  is the lower of the two (amount resulting from Step 1 and amount resulting from 
Step 2).  
 
Beneficiary balance  
 For more guidance on grant reductions , see the Guidance on grant reductions . 
 The amount due  is used to determine whether the terminated beneficiary received too much from the 
consortium (and should pay it back to them) and will then flow into the calculation of the next interim and 
final payments in order to cap that beneficiary's accepted EU co ntribution.  
 The terminated beneficiary's share of the final grant amount (beneficiary's final grant share) will be 
calculated only at the end of the project (payment of the balance), together with the rest of the 
conso rtium.  
 If the terminated beneficiary is audited during the ongoing project, its amount due will be re -
calculated. If the terminated beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the 
standard rules (revised final grant amount calculated on the basis of the final grant share).

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  200 Step 3 —  Calculation of the beneficiary balance  
In order to establish if the beneficiary  received excess funding, the Commission/Agency 
will deduct the total amount of pre -financing and interim payments made (according to 
the report on the distribution of payments) from the amount due.   
If the amount due is higher  than the payments already ma de, the difference will be paid 
by the Commission/Agency to the coordinator  at the next interim/final payment.  
If the amount due is lower  than the payments made, the beneficiary must repay the 
difference (to the consortium; NOT to the Commission/Agency). If the beneficiary 
doesn’t, the Commission/Agency will intervene, by activating the Guarantee Fund to pay 
the money to the consortium and then recovering it from the beneficiary in the name of 
the Guarantee Fund (see below ). 
If the coordinator does not submit the report on the distribution of payments, the 
terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium. If there 
are issues, the consortium will have to deal with them internally.  
Step 4 —  Beneficiary calculation  letter  
The Commission/Agency will inform the beneficiary about the balance, i.e. the amounts 
that are owed to the consortium  or to the beneficiary concerned  (beneficiary termination 
calculation  letter).  
If the closure involves grant reduction or recovery (refund to the consortium), there will 
be two letters: a pre -information letter (opening a contradictory procedure) and 
confirmation letter  (see Articles 43  and 44). 
Recovery ( if any)  
Step 5 —  Beneficiary recovery letter & deb it note  
If the beneficiary does not repay the  consortium by the date specified in the 
confirmation letter, the Commission/Agency will activate the Guarantee Fund (to pay the 
consortium) and claim back the money paid by the Guarantee Fund from the 
beneficiary , (beneficiary recovery letter ; see Articles 44  and 50). 
Step 6 —  Enforced recovery  
If the beneficiary does not honour the debit note within the deadline, the 
Commission/Agency will enforce its claim, by one of the following (see Article 44 ): 
 by offsetting  it 
‘Offsetting’  means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency 
from another amount that the Commission/Agency owes to debtor. With the 
offsetting both amounts are considered paid.  
 if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability fro m a linked 
third party: by holding the linked third party liable  
 taking legal action  in a national court or the European Court of Justice  (see Article 
57.2) or 
 adopting a decision  that is enforceable  within the meaning of Article 299 TFEU . 
 
Example for calculating the amount due at  beneficiary termination:  
Grant with  three beneficiaries (A, B and C)  and two reporting periods .  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500  000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2 : A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
200 000; C= EUR 100 000 ). 
Reimbursement rate: 100  %. 
Pre-financing: EUR 200 000.  
Amount due:  
Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated  at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of 
RP1. 
Costs declared by beneficiary A in termination report: EUR 50 000 (direct costs) + EUR 12 500 (25  % flat rate for 
indirect costs) = E UR 62 500.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  201 Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit: EUR 10 000 + EUR 2 500 (25  % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 
12 500. 
Accepted costs beneficiary A:  EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50  000. 
Application of reimbursement rate: EUR 50  000 (total a ccepted EU contribution).  
Amount  resulting from Step 1 : EUR 50  000. 
10% grant reduction  beneficiary A  due to breach of obligations : 10% of {{18/36 } x EUR 200 000 } = 10% of EUR 
100 000 = EUR 10  000. 
Amount resulting from Step 2: 100 000 – 10 000 = EUR 90  000. 
Lower amount of the two: EUR 50  000. 
Beneficiary A amount  due: EUR 50  000. 
Beneficiary balance : 
Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution of payments): EUR 60 000. 
Beneficiary A balance: EUR 50 000 (amount due) - EUR 60 000 (payments received)  = EUR -10 000 (excess 
payments of EUR 10 000).  
Recovery:  
Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative  balance of EUR 10 000 must be returned to the 
consortium; otherwise Commission/Agency will start a recov ery procedure).  
 
Interim payments  
How much?  The amount of the interim payments will be calculated by the Commission/Agency 
on the basis of the financial statement s and the payment s already made . 
How to calculat e interim payments:  
Step 1 —  Calculation of the accepted EU contribution  (application of the reimbursement 
rates to the eligible costs)  
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution,  the Commission/Agency 
will, for each beneficiary and linked third party, calculate the accepted costs (i.e. 
eligible/not reject ed costs declared in the financial statement; see Articles 6  and 42), 
apply the reimbursement rate(s)  and then sum them up to a total amount for the 
consortium.   
If a benefi ciary/linked third party requested in the financial statements less than the EU 
contribution, the accepted EU contribution will be this lower requested amount.  
Step 2 —  Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount  
If the total for the consortium is more than 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus 
pre-financing  and previous interim payments, it will be capped.  
Step 3 —  Interim payment letter  
The Commission/ Agency will inform the coordinator about the amount due (interim 
payment letter).   
 
Example s for calculating  interim payments:  
Case 1 :  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three  reporting periods.  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% reimbursement rate.  
Pre-financing of EUR 333 334.  
Interim payment RP1:  
Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 500 000 (direct costs) + EUR 125  000 (25% flat rate for indirect 
costs) = EUR  625  000. 
After checking the reports EUR  20 000 of the direct costs claimed by beneficiary A and EUR  12 000 of those 
claimed by benef iciary B are considered not eligible and  reject ed. The Commission /Agency therefore  rejects 
EUR  32 000 direct costs + EUR  8 000 (25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = EUR 40 000.  
Total accepted costs RP1 : EUR 585  000. 
Application of reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 585 000  (total accepted EU contribution).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  202 Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus  pre-financing = EUR 900  000 – EUR 333 334 = EUR 566 666. 
Amount to be paid out to the consortium  as interim payment for RP1: EUR  566 666 . 
Interim payment RP 2:  
Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162  500.  
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0  (the 90% limit has already been 
reached in RP1: 333 334 + 566 666 = 900 000 ). 
 
Case 2 ( grant with terminated beneficiary):   
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500  000  (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
200 000; C= EUR 100 000) . 
Reimbursement rate: 100%.  
Pre-financing: EUR 200  000. 
Beneficiary A was  terminated before the end of RP1 and the amount due  was its accepted costs :EUR 62 500 EUR  
(no grant reductions applied) . 
Interim payment RP1:  
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 50   000 (direct costs) + EUR 12 500 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs) = 
EUR 62 500.  
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1 : EUR 115  000 (direct costs) + EUR 28  750 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 143  750. 
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1 : EUR 90  000 (direct costs) + EUR 22  500 ( 25% flat rate for indir ect costs ) = 
EUR 112  500. 
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 62 500 + EUR 143  750 + EUR 112  500 = EUR 318 750.  
Costs of beneficiary A are  not capped since there were no grant reductions at beneficiary termination . 
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary B are  rejected for an amount of EUR 10  000 + EUR 2  500 (25  % flat rate 
for indirect costs) = EUR 12  500. 
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 318 750 – EUR 12  500 = EUR 306 250 . 
Application of the reimbursement rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution).  
Limit to 90  % of the maximum grant amount minus pre -financing: EUR 450  000 – EUR 200  000 = EUR 250  000. 
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250  000.  
 
Case 3:  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three report ing periods.  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500  000  (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
200 000; C= EUR 100 000) . 
Reimbursement rate : 100%.  
Pre-financing: EUR 200  000. 
Interim payment RP1:  
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP1: EUR 95  000 (direct costs) + EUR 23  750 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 118  750. 
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP1 : EUR 115  000 (direct costs) +  EUR 28  750 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 143  750. 
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP1 : EUR 90  000 (direct costs) +  EUR 22  500 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 112  500. 
Total costs declared RP1: EUR 118 750 + EUR 143  750 + EUR 112  500 = EUR 375  000. 
Some direct costs declared by beneficiary A a re rejected for an amount of EUR 10  000 + EUR 2  500 (25  % flat rate 
for indirect costs) = EUR 12  500. 
Total accepted costs RP 1: EUR 375  000 – EUR 12  500 = EUR 362  500. 
Application of the reimbursement rate 100%: EUR 362 500 (total accepted EU contribution ). 
Limit to 90  % of the maximum grant amount minus pre -financing: EUR 450  000 – EUR 200  000 = EUR 250  000. 
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 250  000.  
Interim payment RP2:  
Costs declared by beneficiary A for RP2 : EUR 20 000 (direct costs) + EUR 5  000 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 25 000.  
Costs declared by beneficiary B for RP2 : EUR 30 000 (direct costs) + EUR 7  500 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 37 500.  
Costs declared by beneficiary C for RP2 : EUR 30 000 (direct costs) +EUR 7  500 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = 
EUR 37  500. 
Total costs declared RP2: EUR  25 000 + EUR 37 500 + EUR 37  500 = EUR 100  000.

EUR 12  500.  
Costs rejected for beneficiary C at RP2: 5 000 (direct costs) + 1 250 ( 25% flat rate for indirect costs ) = EUR 6  250. 
Total accepted costs RP2 =  EUR 81  250. 
Application of the reimbursement rate 100%: EUR 81 250 (total ac cepted EU contribution).  
Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0  (the 90% limit has already been 
reached in RP1:  EUR 200  000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 450  000). 
 
Payment of the balance  
How much?  The amount  to be paid (or recovered) at  payment of the balance  (final payment) will 
be calculated by the Commission/Agency on the basis of the financial statements, the final grant 
amount, the payments already made and the report on the distribution of payments  (see also 
Articles 5.3 and 44.1.2 ). 
If the final grant amount is higher  than the payments already made, the balance will take the form 
of a payment ; if the final grant amount is lower  than the payments made, the balance will take 
the form of a recovery . 
How to calculate the payment of the balance : 
Final grant amount  
Step 1 —  Calculation of the accepted EU contribution (application of the reimbursement 
rates to the eligible costs)  
In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution, the Commission/Agency 
will, for each beneficiary /linked third party, calculate  the accepted costs (i.e. eligible/not 
reject ed costs declared in the financial statements;  see Articles 6  and 42), apply the 
reimbursement rate (s) and then sum them up to a total amount for the consortium.  
If a beneficiary/linked third party  requested less than the maximum EU contribution, the 
accepted EU contri bution will be this lower requested amount.  
Step 2 —  Limit to the maximum grant amount  
If the total for the consortium is more than the maximum grant amount  for the action  
(see Article 5.1 ), it will be capped  at that amount  
Step 3 —  Calculation of  receipts & deduction  of profit ( no-profit rule ) 
From this amount, the Commission/Agency will deduct any profit made due to receipts.  
Thus, the total accepted EU contribution +  receipts  are capped at the total accepted  
costs; the amount resulting from  Steps 1 and 2 plus receipts cannot exceed the 
accepted  costs.   
If grant amount + receipts > total accepted  costs  deduction of profit   
 
 
 
 
 
The receipts  that must be taken into account are receipts which have been , during the 
action duration (see Article 3 ): 
 established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts)  
 generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been 
generated) or 
 confirmed  (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but for which the 
beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation) . 
 Profit is assessed at the level of the action , NOT at the level of the individual 
beneficiaries (
  new in Horizon 2020 ).  
The amount s taken into account are the total accepted EU contribution  (following Steps 1 
and 2), the total receipts and the total accepted  costs.   
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  204 The following are considered receipts : 
 income generated by the action  (i.e. any income generated by the action 
itself, including the sale of assets bought for the action and sold during the 
action duration)   
Examples: admission fee to a conference organised by the consortium; sale of 
equipment bought for the action.  
Receipts from the sale of assets are capped at the amount of costs declared 
for the asset.  
Example:  
Machine bought for EUR 21 000 in year X, sold in year X + 4 (both within the 
action duration) for EUR 16 000.  
The machine was used at 50% for the action, and fully depreciated in 3 years 
(7 000 EUR/year, of which 3 500 EUR/year were charged to the action)  
Amount of receipts to be declared: 50% of 16 000 with a limit of 10 500 (3 x 3 
500) = EUR 8 000  
 financial contributions given by third par ties specifically to be used for the 
action (i.e. money given as a donation by a third party (a donor) to a 
beneficiary/linked third party specifically for being used for the action)  
 in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge  specifical ly to 
be used for the action, if they have been declared as eligible costs  (i.e. not 
money, but an in -kind contribution free of charge given by a third party (a 
donor) specifically for being used for the action)   
Examples:  the free use of equipment; the secondment of an expert without 
reimbursement  
Receipts due to  free of charge in -kind contributions are capped by the 
amount declared as third party costs for the contribution.  
The following are NOT considered  receipts : 
 in-kind contributions given by a third party (donor)  free of charge — if 
they were not given specifically to be used for the action  
Example: A university professor whose costs are charged by the beneficiary 
university in the GA, but whose salary is paid by  the ministry and not 
reimbursed by the university: This in -kind contribution from a third party (the 
ministry) is not to be considered a receipt, unless the professor has been 
specifically seconded by the ministry to the university to work for the action in 
question. In other words, if the university is free to decide the allocation of the 
professor's work, then his/her contribution is assimilated to an ‘own resource’ of 
the university and it is not a receipt.  
 financial contributions given by a third party  (donor) specifically to be used 
for the action — if they may be used according to the donor’s rules to cover 
also costs other  than the eligible costs  
Example:  currency exchange losses  
 financial contributions given by a third party (donor) specifically to be used 
for the action — if the donor did not set the obligation to repay any unused 
amount at the end of the action  
In this case, t he full amount of the financial contribution is cons idered not a 
receipt (not only the unused amount).  
 financial contributions made by one beneficiary to another  within the 
same action — since receipts are only contributions from third parties  
Conversely, such a financial contribution cannot either be decl ared as cost 
for the action.  
Example: Beneficiary A (big company) in an innovation project (i.e. funded at 
70%) decides to subsidise a small specialised SME by funding  an additional 
10% of the SME’s costs in order to encourage it to participate in the action.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  205  income generated by exploiting the results of the project (e.g. the IPR)  — 
since successfully exploiting the results is one of the main objectives of the 
action  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Amount resulting from Steps 1 -3. 
Step 4 —  Grant reductions  (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations ), if any  
In order to calculate the amount of grant reductions  (if any) , the Commission/Agency 
will, for each beneficiary/linked third party, calculate the grant reductions at their level , 
add any red uctions that must be made at action -level and then sum them up to a total 
amount for the consortium (see Article 43 ).  
This total amount of grant reductions for the consortium is then deducted from the 
maximum grant amount for the action set out in Article 5.1 . 
 
 
 
 Amount resulting from Step 4.  
The final grant amount  is the lower of the 2 (amount resulting from Steps 1 -3 and amount 
resulting from Step 4).  
Balance  
Step 5 —  Calculation of the balance  & Guarantee Fund release  
In order to calculate the balance, the Commission/Agency will deduct the total amount 
of pre -financing and interim payments made from the final grant amount.  
If the final grant amount is higher  than the payments already made, the balance will 
take the form of a payment. In addition, the Guaran tee Fund contribution ( 5% that were 
kept from the pre -financing) will be released with a separate  payment . 
If the final grant amount is lower  than the payments made, the balance will take the 
form of a recovery  (amount overpaid needs to be paid back to the  Commission/Agency; 
see Article 44 ). In this case, the amount to be paid back will be directly compensated  
against the Guarantee Fund release and if this amount is sufficient to cover the debt, 
the recovery process ends (instead the consortium will be paid the remainder of the 
Guarantee Fund contribution, if any is left). If the Guarantee Fund amount is not 
sufficient, further steps will be taken to recover the rest (see below) .  
Step 6 —  Payment of the balance letter & debit note  
The Commission/Agency will inform  the coordinator about the amount due to the 
consortium or the amount that needs to be paid back ( payment of the balance letter).  
 For more guidance on grant reductions , see the Guidance on grant reductions . 
 Receipts will be taken into account by the Commission/Agency only at the moment of 
the payment of the balance (i.e. the final payment at the end of the action) . They must 
be declare d in the final report.  
In many cases they will not affect the grant amount since they do not lead to a profit  
(at the level of the action) . However, particularly in actions funded at 100%, they may 
have an impact and cause a reduction.  
Examples:  
1. Eligible costs: 100 and grant amount: 70  
If receipts: 30  no impact  
If receipts:  20  no impact  
If receipts: 60  the grant amount will be reduced to 40.  
2. Eligible costs: 100 and grant amount: 100  
If receipts: 0  no impact;  
If receipts: 20  the grant amount will be reduced to 80  
Best pract ice: The potential implications of receipts should be addressed in the 
consortium agreement (see Article 41.3 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  206 If the final payment involves a grant reduction or recovery, there will be two letters: a 
pre-information letter (opening a contradictory procedure) and a confirmation letter (see 
Articles 43  and 44). 
If there is still an amount to be recovered  after compensation with the Guarantee Fund 
release , the confirmation letter will include a debit note to the coordinator for the 
amount and the division of final grant amoun t table (see below) . 
Recovery ( if any)  
Step 7a —  Recovery from the coordinator  
If the coordinator pays the debt by the date specified in the debit note , the recovery 
process ends.  
 If the coordinator does NOT repay  the Commission/Agency by the date specified AND if 
it has NOT submitted the report on the distribution of payments , the 
Commission/Agency will pursue recovery against  the coordinator alone  (enforced 
recovery, see below ). 
Step 7b —  Recovery from the benef iciaries  
If the coordinator does NOT repay the Commission/Agency by the date specified, BUT 
has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the Commission/Agency will:  
 identify the beneficiaries that received funds in excess and  
 calculate the am ount each beneficiary owes to the Commission/Agency.  
Step 7ba — Identifying  the beneficiaries with excess funding   
In order to identify the beneficiaries that received excess funding, the  
Commission/Agency will compare the  amount each beneficiary actually  received (report 
on the distribution of payments)  with its share of the final grant amount  (beneficiary’s 
accepted EU contribution divided by total accepted  EU contribution  and obtained 
percentage then applied to final grant amount) . 
Beneficiary’s final g rant share formula:  
{{{beneficiary’s accepted costs  
multiplied by  
reimbursement rate } 
divided by  
accepted EU contribution calculated under Step 1 } 
multiplied  by 
final grant amount for the action } 
This means that the final grant amount is redistributed between the beneficiaries  in 
proportion to their accepted costs (especially important for overspent grants, i.e. where 
the consortium decl ared costs above  the maximum grant amount limit and each 
beneficiary’s accepted EU contribution  must therefore be adju sted to bring it into line 
with the maximum grant amount ) and then compared to the amounts they received 
from the coordinator.  
Recovery will be pursued only against the beneficiaries with a negative result (i.e. 
excess of payments received over final grant  amount  share ).  
Step 7bb — Division of the debt   
In order to calculate the amount each  of those  beneficiar ies has to pay back, the 
Commission/Agency will split  the amount to be recovered between the m (in proportion 
to their relative share of the total payments in excess ; division of final grant amount  
table) . 
Step 7bc — Beneficiary recovery letter  & debit note   
The Commission/Agency will cancel the debit note sent to the coordinator and inform 
the beneficiaries  concerned about the amounts to be paid back, together with a debit 
note for each beneficiary  (beneficiary recovery  letter) .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  207 Step 8 —  Enforced recovery  
If the coordinator/beneficiaries do not honour the debit note within the deadline, the 
Commission/Agenc y will enforce its claim(s) by one of the following (see Article 44 ): 
 by offsetting  it 
‘Offsetting’  means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency 
from another amount that the Commission/Agency owes to debtor. With the 
offsetting both amounts are considered paid.  
 by drawing on the Guarantee Fund and then follow it  up with a debit no te on 
behalf of  the Guarantee Fund , to continue the recovery procedure by : 
 if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked 
third party: by holding the linked third party liable  
or 
 by either:  
 taking legal action  in a national court or the European Court of Justice  (see 
Article 57.2 ) or 
 adopting a decision  that is enforceable  within the meaning of Article 299

Example s for calculating the payment of the balance : 
Case 1 (payment):  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C)  and three reporting periods . 
Maximum grant amount: EUR 1 000 000.  
Reimbursement rate: 100%.  
Payments made (p re-financing and interim): EUR 900 000  (limit of 90% of the maximum grant amount ). 
Guarantee Fund contribution: 5% of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 50 000.  
Payments received: EUR 900 000 – EUR 50 000 = EUR 850 000.  
Final grant amount:   
Total accepted costs: EUR 1  045  000.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  210 Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount  
The amount to be recovered (or paid) after the final payment will be calculated by the 
Commission/Agency on the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount  
(see also Articles 5.4 and 44.1.3 ).  
If the revised final grant amount is lower  than the beneficiary’s share of the final grant amount  
(beneficiary final grant share) , the difference will be recovered.  
How to calculate  recoveries after payment of the balance : 
Revised f inal grant amount  
Step 1 —  Re-calculation of the accepted EU contribution  
In order to calculate the revised amount of accepted EU contribution for  the beneficiary 
concerned , the Commission/Agency will calculate the revised amount of accepted costs 
for the beneficiary (i.e. eligible/not rejected costs declared in the financial statements; 
see Articles 6  and 42) and apply the reimbursement rate.  
If the audit concerns a linked third party, the revised final grant amount will be 
calculated for its beneficiary.  
 Amount resulting from Step 1.  
Step 2 —  Grant reductions (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations) , if any   
In order to calculate the amount of grant reductions, the Commission/Agency will 
calculate the grant reduction for the beneficiary concerned (if any; see Article 43 ). 
This amount of grant reduction is then deducted from the beneficiary’s maximum grant  
amount  set out in Annex 2 . 
If the audit concerns a linked third party, the grant reduction will be calculated for the 
linked third party (i.e. deducted from its maximum grant amount), but the revised final 
grant amount will be calculated at beneficiary -level.  
For beneficiar ies that overspent (i.e. declared more costs at payment of the balance 
than their maximum grant amount), the reduction rate (percentage) will be applied 
directly to the ir share of the final grant amount and the resulting amount will be 
recovered (—short cut  to ensure a proportionate result for beneficiaries that contributed 
more to the action than initially planned in the estimated budget;  avoids 
disproportionate grant reductions compared to the real project participation ; see also 
Article 4.2 ). 
 
 
 
 Amount resulting from Step 2.  
The revised final grant amount is the lower of the two (amount resulting from Step 1 and amount 
resulting from Step 2).  
Balance & r ecovery ( if any)  
Step 3 —  Calculation of the beneficiary balance  
In order to calculate if the  beneficiary has to pay back any amounts , the 
Commission/Agency will compare the beneficiary’s  revised final grant amount  with its 
final grant share (see above ). 
Beneficiary’s final grant share formula:  
{{{beneficiary’s accepted costs  
multiplied by  
reimbursement rate } 
divided by  
 For more guidance on grant reductions , see the  Guidance on grant reductions . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  211 accepted EU contribution calculated under Step 1 } 
multiplied  by 
final grant amount for the action } 
If the revised final grant amount is lower  than its final grant share , the difference will be 
recovered.  
If exceptionally the audit (or check, review or investigation) showed that the beneficiary 
made errors resulting in less cost declared than its eligible costs , there will be no 
recovery. Instead, the beneficiary will be allowed to submit corrected financia l 
statements to claim  the difference.  
Step 4 —  Audit implementation letters & debit note  
The Commission/Agency will inform  the beneficiary about the  amounts put in question 
(audit  implementation letter).  
If the audit implementation involves a grant reduct ion or recovery (generally the case), 
there will be two letters : a pre-information letter (opening a contradictory procedure) 
and a confirmation letter (see Articles 4 3 and 44). 
If there is an amount to be recovered, the confirmation letter will include  a debit note  
for the amount . 
 
 
 
 
Step 5 —  Enforced recovery  
If the beneficiary does not honour the debit note within the deadline, the 
Commission/Agency will enforce its claim by one of the following  (see Article 44 ): 
 by offsetting  it 
‘Offsetting’  means to deduct the amount the debtor owes  to the Commission/Agency 
from another amount that the Commission/Agency owes to debtor. With the 
offsetting both amounts are considered paid.  
 by drawing on the Guarantee Fund and then follow it up with a debit note  on 
behalf of  the Guarantee Fund , to continue the recovery procedure by : 
 if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked 
third party: by holding the linked third party liable  
or 
 by either:  
 taking legal action  in a national court or the European Court of Justice  (see 
Article 57.2 ) or 
 adopting a decision  that is enforceable  within the meaning of Article 299 
TFEU. 
 
Examples for calculating recoveries after  payment of the balance:  
Case 1 (recovery – underspent grant):  
Grant  with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) .  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 500  000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2 : A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
200 000; C= EUR 100 000 ). 
Reimbursement rate : 100  %. 
Final grant amount:  
Total accepted costs : EUR 187  500 + EUR 156  250 + EUR 150  000 = EUR 493  750 
A: EUR 150  000 (direct costs) + EUR 37  500 (25  % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 187  500 
B: EUR 125  000 (direct costs) + EUR 31  250 (25  % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 156  250 
 In case of  European Court of Auditor audits, OLAF investigations and Member State 
judgments with a financial impact on the grant , similar  procedures  and letters will be used.

(explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the use of resources, etc.), 
for consistency with the d escription and work plan of the action.  
2. The Agency performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the consortium . 
3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning a certain beneficiary that participates in EU 
actions, the Commission checks all the grant agreements in order to see if it needs to take action.  
4. After the end of the action, the Commission receives a complaint by one of the beneficiaries that 
another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and decides to look into this 
allegation.  
The check s itself are internal . They may h owever have external effects, since t he 
Commission/Agency may lead to a request for information  (see Article 1 7.1) or it may take 
Chapter 6 measures in view of the results .  
Example:  The beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation and use of resources in their periodic 
report. The Commission asks for more information by a certain date.  
The checks  may also extend to third parties involved in the action (which is why beneficiaries must 
ensure that the Commission/Agency can exercise its rights towards contractors, subcontractors, 
linked third parties or third parties providing in -kind contributions, by including appropriate 
clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10 -14). 
The Commission/Agency may carry out checks using its own staff or with the assistance of 
external expert(s) or bod ies — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing 
them. In this case, t he Commission/Agency will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by 
asking the expert(s) to sign a declaration.  ARTICLE 22 — CHECKS, REVIEWS, AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS — EXTENSION OF 
FINDINGS  
22.1 Checks, reviews and audits by the [Agency and the] Commission

1. Project r eviews  
The Commission/Agency may — at any moment and up until 2 years after the payment of the 
balance — carry out a review.   
Reviews  normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action (i.e. its scientific 
and technological implementation), but may also cover financial and budgetary aspects or 
compliance with other obligations under the GA  and may exceptionally also conc ern issues 
related to only one specific beneficiary .  22.1.2 Right to carry out reviews  
The [Agency or the] Commission may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry 
out reviews on the proper implementation of the action  (including assessment of deliverables and reports), 
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement and continued scientific or technological relevance of 
the action.  
Reviews may be started up to two years after the payment of the balance . They will be formally notified to 
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
notification.  
If the review is carried out on a third party (see  Articles 10 to 16 ), the beneficiary concerned must inform 
the third party.  
The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out reviews directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will in form the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of 
the identity of the external persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds 
of commercial confidentiality.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must provide — within the d eadline requested — any information 
and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including information on the use of 
resources). The [Agency or the] Commission may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it 
directly.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings , including with 
external experts.  
For on-the-spot reviews, the beneficiaries must allow access to their sites and premises, including to 
external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available.  
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including 
electronic format.  
On the basis of the review findings, a ‘ review report ’ will be drawn up.  
The [Agen cy or the] Commission will formally notify the review report to the coordinator or beneficiary 
concerned, which has 30 days to formally notify observations (‘ contradictory  review procedure ’). 
Reviews (including review reports) are in the language of the Agreement.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 22.1.2  217 They consist in an in -depth examination (often done with the help of independent experts) of 
the progress of the action, and in particular : 
 the degree to which the work plan has been carried out and whether all 
deliverables were completed  
 whether the objectives are still relevant and provide scientific or industrial 
breakthrough potential  
 how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if 
their use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness  
 the management procedures and methods of the action  
 the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action  
 the expected potential scientific, technological, economic, competitive and social 
impact, and plans for using and disseminating results.  
For some types of actions, they may be done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to 
a payment, to help the Commission/Agency to properly assess the action implementation and 
the work carried out by the beneficiaries) . 
They may also extend to third parties involved in the action (which is why beneficiaries must 
ensure that the Commission/Agency can exercise its rights towards contractors, 
subcontractors, linked third parties or third parties pr oviding in -kind contributions, by including 
appropriate clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10 -14). 
If the review shows ineligible  costs or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or serious 
breach of obligations  (including non - or improper implementation of the action as described in 
Annex 1) , it may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction  and recovery 
(see Articles 42 -44, 47-50) and to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 45 ).  
If carried out during the implementation of the action, a review may  also recommend 
reorientations to the action.  
 
2. Procedure  
The review will be initiated by a letter  sent to the coordinator  (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary 
concerned)  via the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts  that have been appointed (if 
any). The consortium may object to an expert, but only on the grounds of commercial 
confidentiality.  
The review may include on-the-spot visits  or a review meeting  (on Commission/Agency 
premises or anywhere relevant for the action).  
If there is a meeting, the invitation will indicate the documents that  will be discussed, 
normally:  
 Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will 
be made)   
 for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s) 
under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues)  
 deliverables that were due  
 for final reviews: the final report and all periodic reports.

1. Audits  
The Commission/Agency may — at any moment and up until 2 years after the payment of the 
balance — carry out an audit.  
 22.1.3   Right to carry out audits  
The [Agency or the] Commission  may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry 
out audits on the proper implementation of the action and compliance with the obligations under the 
Agreement.  
Audits may be started up to two years after the payment of the balance. They will b e formally notified to 
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
notification.  
If the audit is carried out on a third party (see  Articles 10 to 16 ), the beneficiar y concerned must inform the 
third party.  
The [Agency or the] Commission  may carry out audits directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will inform the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of 
the identity of the external persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds 
of commercial confidentiality.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must provide — within the deadline requested — any 
information (including comple te accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify 
compliance with the Agreement. The [Agency or the] Commission  may request beneficiaries to provide 
such information to it directly  
For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiaries must allow access to their sites and premises, including to 
external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available.  
Information provided must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including 
electroni c format.  
On the basis of the audit findings, a ‘ draft audit report ’ will be drawn up.  
The [Agency or the] Commission  will formally notify the draft audit report to the coordinator or 
beneficiary  concerned, which has 30 days to formally notify observations  (‘contradictory audit 
procedure ’). This period may be extended by the [Agency or the] Commission  in justified cases.  
The ‘ final audit report ’ will take into account observations by the coordinator or beneficiary concerned. 
The report will be formally noti fied to it.  
Audits (including audit reports) are in the language of the Agreement.  
The [Agency or the] Commission may also access the beneficiaries’ statutory records for the periodical 
assessment of unit costs or flat -rate amounts [or lump sums].  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Sect ion 2 > Article 22.1.3  220  
 
 
Audits normally concern mainly the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. 
financial and budgetary implementation), but may also cover technical aspects or compliance 
with other obligations  under the GA.  
They consist in an in -depth ex amination (by professional (external or Commission/Agency) 
auditors and according to the generally accepted audit standards) of the implementation of the 
action by the beneficiary.  
They may also extend to third parties involved in the action and third part ies receiving 
financial support or a prize (which is why beneficiaries must ensure that the 
Commission/Agency auditors can exercise their rights towards contractors, subcontractors, 
linked third parties or third parties providing in -kind contributions, by including appropriate 
clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10 -15). 
Examples:  
1. The Commission/Agency will audit linked third parties , as if they were beneficiaries. The audit will be 
carried out on the premises of the third party and all communication concerning the audit will be carried 
out directly with the linked third party (e.g. audit initiation letter, contradictory audit procedu re). 
However, since the financial consequences would normally have to be borne by the linked third party’s 
beneficiary (see Article 44 ), the Commission/Agency will also notify the beneficiary about the launching 
the audit, as w ell as about a summary of its conclusions.  
2. The Commission/Agency may audit third parties providing in -kind contributions  (free of charge or 
against payment), in the context of an audit of a beneficiary, in order to see if the costs claimed for the in -
kind contribution are eligible. The audit procedure  will formally be with the beneficiary  and the beneficiary 
will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary documents and to the third 
party’s premises, if necessary.  
3. The C ommission/Agency may audit contractors or subcontractors , in the context of an audit of a 
beneficiary, in order to : 
 see if contracts/subcontracts were awarded in compliance with the requirements of the H2020 GA 
(ensuring best value  for money or , if appropriate , the lowest price, absence of conflict of interest)  
 see if payments made under the contract/subcontract match th e costs  declared by the beneficiary  
 assess the technical work carried out by the subcontractor.  
The audit procedure will formal ly be with the beneficiary  and t he beneficiary will be  responsible for 
ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary documents and to carry out checks on the 
contractor/subcontra ctor’s premises, if necessary. The audit  will not aim to check the 
contractors’/subcontractors’ costs  or accounts , because the remuneration they get is a set price, not a 
reimbursement of costs (except in cases of fraud).   
4. The Commission/Agency may audit  recipients of financial support or prizes , in the context of an 
audit of a beneficiary, in order to see whether the eligibility conditions for the costs declared by the 
beneficiary are met.  The audit procedure will formally be with the beneficiary  and the beneficiary will be 
responsible for ensuring that the auditors h ave access to all necessary documents and to the recipient’s 
premises, if necessary. The audit  will normally not aim to assess t he costs incurred by the recipients  
(since they are not relevant for the eligibility of the beneficiary ’s costs ) — unless  Annex 1 of the GA 
provides that the financial support must be given as reimbursement of the actual costs of the third parties . 
If the audit shows, ineligible costs , substantial errors, irregularities or fraud    or serious 
breach  of obligations , it may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection , grant reduction 
and recovery (see Articles 42 -44, 47-50) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial 
penalties (see Article 45 ). In some cases, findings may result in the acceptance  of additional  
costs (if the beneficiary declared them).  
Specific case s (audits):  
Audits for p eriodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Commission /Agency  may also 
audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items 
for which it has fixed unit costs, flat -rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to 
assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits will normally have no direct 
consequences for the beneficiaries t hat were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this 
will not lead to a rejection of costs.  
 Record -keeping — Once an audit has started, the beneficiary must keep ALL the records and 
supporting documents until the audit procedure AND its follow -up (including  cost rejection, grant 
reduction, recovery and litigati on) is completed.   
Example:  If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on its 
premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 22.1.3  221 2. Procedure  
The audit will be initiated by a letter  sent to the beneficiary concerned  (via the Funding & Tenders 
Portal  or by registered post with proof of delivery; see Article 52 ).  
If the Commission /Agency  uses an external audit f irm, this letter will mention its name . The 
beneficiary  may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality (together with the reasons 
why) and  — if justified  — the Commission/Agency may decide to appoint another external 
auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit itself).  
The audit usually involves a desk review  of the documents requested from the beneficiary and an 
on-the-spot visit  (i.e. on  the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the action is b eing 
implemented ). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk review.  
The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips, 
labour contracts , complete statutory accounts, etc .) and will indicate how  and when it must be 
provided (and in which format ). 
The beneficiary must provide the auditors with all requested information, records and 
supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified).  
Example:  A hard copy list of records from the  general ledger (accounting document) disclosing 
hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will 
normally require an electronic version.  
Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted.   
Where the records and documentation contain personal data, the Commission/Agency 
will process it in compliance with Regulation  2018/1725  and the beneficiary must 
inform the persons concerned about this processing (see Article 39 ).  
Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 36 . 
Failure to provide the requested informa tion (in the requested format and within the 
specified deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs (and possibly other measures, 
such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial 
penalties, etc.).  
For on -the-spot audits,  the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all 
records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to 
research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.  
The results  of the audit will be recorded in an audit report . 
The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned for comments within 30 days 
(contradictory audit procedure ). (This is NOT the contradictory procedure described in 
Article 42 . It is a separate procedure that may, if necessary, be followed by a second 
contradictory procedure for cost rejection, grant reduction, etc. under Articles 41  to 46.) 
The audit proce dure will be closed (by the Commission/Agency auditors) with the  final audit 
report  and the letter  of audit conclusions  (LoC)  — and the file will then  be passed on to the 
Commission/Agency operational services (authorising officer s) for the follow -up, if any.  
 
 
 
 If there are cost adjustments  in favour of the EU budget  to be made  on the basis of the audit , please 
do not  take any immediate action  (do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement). If needed, the 
adjustments wi ll be done by the Commission/Agency and you will be informed about them in the payment 
letter or audit implementation pre -information letter (with the possibility to take position) .

1. OLAF i nvestigations  
OLAF is the EU’s anti -fraud office, responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.   
If the Commission/Agency suspects that a  beneficiary or third party involved in an action 
committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF, who may decide to investigate.  
OLAF will send the outcome  of the investigation to the Commission /Agency , who will then decide 
how to proceed.  
If an OLAF investigation  shows ineligible costs , substantial errors, irregularities or fraud   or 
serious breach of  obligations , it may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant 
reduction  and recovery  (see Articles 42 -44, 47-50), to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see 
Article 45 ), as well as  to criminal prosecution before the national authorities.  22.2 Investigations by the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF)  
Under Regulations No 883/201341 and No 2185/9642 (and in accordance with their provisions and 
procedures), the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF)  may — at any moment during implementation of 
the action or afterwards — carry out investigations, including on -the-spot checks and inspections, to 
establish whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial 
interests  of the EU.

1. ECA c hecks and a udits  
The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the (entirely independent) external auditing body for all 
European institutions . As such, it may carry out audits on all recipient s of EU funds (including 
beneficiaries, third parties involved in the action and recipients of financial support or prizes).  
Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the beneficiary.   
If the Commission/Agency intends to reject costs on the basis of the findings of the Court  of 
Auditors , it will inform the beneficiary and  give it the possibility to make observations.  
If an ECA check or audit shows ineligible costs , substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or 
serious breach  of obligations , this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant 
reduction  and recovery  (see Articles 42 -44, 47-50) and to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see 
Article 45 ). 22.3 Checks  and audits by the European Court of Auditors (ECA)  
Under Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 161 of 
the Financial Regulation No 966/201243, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) may — at any moment 
during i mplementation of the action or afterwards — carry out audits.  
The ECA has the right of access for the purpose of checks and audits.

1. Checks, reviews, audits and investigations for international organisations  
Checks, reviews, audits and investi gations may also be made  with regard  to beneficiaries that are 
international organisations  (IOs).  
 
 
If there is a specific agreement concluded with the international organisation (and this agreement 
cover s checks, reviews, audits and investigations ), the Commission/Agency will apply the  
agreement.  
Example:  A Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement (FAFA) signed between the European Union 
and the international organisation.   22.4 Checks, reviews, audits and investigations for international organisations  
[OPTION 1 for international organisations : In conformity with its financial regulations, the European 
Union, including  the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Court of Auditors (ECA), 
may undertake, including on the spot, checks, reviews, audits and investigations.  
This Article will be applied in accordance with any  specific agreement concluded in this respect by the 
international organisation and the European Union. ] 
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable. ] 
 
  Checks, reviews, audits and investigations must however respect the privileges and immunities accorded 
to an international organisation by its constituent documents or international law.

 22.5 Consequences of findings in checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of findings  
22.5.1 Findings in this grant  
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to the 
rejection of ineligible costs (see  Article 42 ), reduction of the grant (see  Article 43 ), recovery of undue 
amounts (see Article 44 ) or to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
Rejection of costs or reduction of the grant after the payment of the balan ce will lead to a revised final grant 
amount (see Article 5.4).  
Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations may lead to a request for amendment for the 
modification of Annex 1 (see Article 55 ). 
Checks, reviews, audits  or investigations that find systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or 
breach of obligations may also lead to consequences in other EU or Euratom grants awarded under similar 
conditions (‘ extension of findings  from this grant to other grants ’). 
Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under national 
law. 
22.5.2 Findings in other grants  
The [Agency or the] Commission may extend findings from other grants to this grant (‘ extension of 
findings from other grants to this grant ’), if:  
(a) the beneficiary concerned is found, in other EU or Euratom grants awarded under similar 
conditions, to have committed systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or breach of 
obligations that have a material impact  on this grant and  
(b) those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants 
affected by the findings — no later than two years after the payment of the balance of this grant.  
The extension of findings may lead to  the rejection of costs (see  Article 42 ), reduction of the grant (see 
Article 43 ), recovery of undue amounts (see  Article 44 ), suspension of payments (see  Article 48 ), 
suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49 ) or termination (see  Article 50 ). 
22.5.3 Procedure  
The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the benefic iary concerned the systemic or recurrent 
errors and its intention to extend these audit findings, together with the list of grants affected.  
22.5.3.1 If the findings concern eligibility of costs : the formal notification will include:  
(a) an invitation to submi t observations on the list of grants affected by the findings;  
(b) the request to submit revised financial statements  for all grants affected;  
(c) the correction rate for extrapolation established by the [Agency or the] Commission on the basis of 
the systemic or recurrent errors, to calculate the amounts to be rejected if the beneficiary 
concerned:  
(i) considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable 
or

1. Extension of findings  (rejection and grant reduction ) 
If the Commission/Agency finds  (typically in a review, audit or OLAF investigation)  substantial 
errors, irregularities  or fraud  or serious breach of obligations  which are systemic  or 
recurrent , it may make a correction (cost reject ion or grant reduction ; see Articles 42  and 43) in: 
 the grant, both for  
 reporting periods that where audited/reviewed and  
 reporting periods that were not audited/reviewed  (extension of the findings ) 
 other grants of th e beneficiary  (extension of the findings ). The beneficiary concerned has 90 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial 
statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction  method . This period may be extended 
by the [Agency or the] Commissio n in justified cases.  
The [Agency or the] Commission may then start a rejection procedure in accordance with Article 42,  on the 
basis of:  
- the revised financial statements, if approved  
- the proposed alternative correction method, if accepted  
or 
- the initially  notified correction rate for extrapolation, if it does not receive any observations or 
revised financial statements, does not accept the observations or the proposed alternative correction 
method or does not approve the revised financial statements.  
22.5.3.2 If the  findings concern substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations, the formal notification will include:  
(a) an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and  
(b) the flat -rate the [Agency or the] Commission intends to apply according to the principle of 
proportionality.  
The beneficiary concerned has 90 days from receiving notification to submit observations or to propose a 
duly substantiated alternative flat -rate. 
The [Agency or the]  Commission may then start a reduction procedure in accordance with Article 43, on the 
basis of:  
- the proposed alternative flat -rate, if accepted  
or 
- the initially notified flat -rate, if it does not receive any observations or does not accept the 
observations or the proposed alternative flat -rate. 
22.6 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, any insufficiently substantiated costs will 
be ineligible (see Article  6) and will be rejected (see  Article 42 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 22.5  227 ‘Recurrent’ means an infringement found in several grants of the beneficiary (and therefore 
likely to also have occurred in the other grants of that beneficiary ).  
Examples (recurrent):  In several grants, the  benef iciary claimed deductible VAT as an eligible cost; 
increased the remuneration of its personnel solely for its contracts with the Commission; did not clearly 
display the EU funding despite the GA’s visibility requirements.  
‘Systemic’  means an infringement that is inherently related to the beneficiary’s methodologies, 
accounting, management or internal control practices (and therefore , by its very nature , likely 
to have occurred in  all other transactions  of the beneficiary that are comp arable/similar  (i.e. 
governed by the same methodologies, accounting management or internal control practices, 
and thus part of the  same  ‘system ’). 
Examples (systemic):  The beneficiary does not keep records of a certain type of transactions ; the 
beneficiary  set up a fraudulent network to overcharge personnel costs  . 
The findings may be extended both to on-going  grants (i.e. grants for which the payment of the 
balance has not yet been carried out) and to closed  grants — up to two years after the payment 
of the balance.  
Findings may be extended  to all other EU or Euratom grants awarded under similar conditions.  
 
 
 
 
2. Procedure  
If find ings are systemic or recurrent , this will already have been mentioned in the audit or review 
report and — like the other aspects of the report — they have been subject to the contradictory 
audit/review procedure .  
If the findings  also impact other EU/Euratom grants , the audit/review  procedure will be followed 
by an extension procedure , to fix the list of impacted grants and ask the beneficiary’s views on the 
method for correction . In order to minimise the administrative burden, this procedure is usually 
centralised.  
Procedure for exte nsion of findings:  
Step 1 —  After the end of the contradictory audit/review procedure, t he Commission/Agency 
auditors send the letter closing the audit/review procedure ( letter of audit 
conclusions ), together with  
 the final audit /review  report  
 the list of grants /reporting periods  to which the audit findings will be extended  
 an invitation to submit comments on the list of grants /reporting periods  
 for cost rejection :  
 a request to submit revised financial statements for the grants /reporting 
periods  on the list  (via a specific form annexed to the letter of audit 
conclusions )  
 the proposed correction rate for extrapolation (if the beneficiary does 
not submit revised financial statements)  
 the conditions for external counter -audits to propose an alterna tive 
correction method (see below)  
 for grant reduction : the proposed flat -rate for the correction . 
 Findings will normally be extended only within one programme (e.g. findings in an H2020 audit to  all 
H2020 grants ) but they may exceptionally also be extended to similar programmes (e.g. if justified by the 
nature of the findings and the similarity of the applicable grant agreements or in case of serious 
irregularities or fraud).     
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 22.5  228 The correction  rate for cost rejection  will normally correspond to  the average 
correction rate calculated  in the sample of audited grants (for the flawed cost 
category (ies) or even for the total costs claimed).  
The flat-rate for grant reductions will normally be based on the relative importance 
of the tasks improperly implemented or the seriousness of the breach of obligations  
— compared to the action  (i.e. calculated according to the principle of 
proportionality).  
 The rate will be used if : 
 the beneficiary explicitly requests it 
Example:  if the beneficiary considers that the administrative workload related to 
submitting revised financial statements f or all the grants affected would be 
disproportionate or impossible and so it decides to accept the correction rate.  
 the beneficiary does not submit revised financial statements or refuses to 
cooperate (in time)  
 the Commission /Agency  cannot approve the revi sed financial statements  
(because they do not properly reflect the audit/review findings)  
 the Commission /Agency  cannot accept the alternative correction method 
proposed by the beneficiary .  
Step 2 —  The beneficiary has 90 days to:  
 submit comments on the list of grants  
If the beneficiary considers that some (or all) of the grants on the list are not 
affected, it must explain why. If the explanation is not sufficient, t he 
Commission/Agency may request additional information or clarification s.  
 submit revise d financial statements (free of the errors or irregularities raised) . 
Example:  An audit finds that the beneficiary claimed the deductible VAT as an 
eligible cost and qualifies this finding as recurrent. The beneficiary agrees with the 
audit conclusions . It submits revised  financial statements correcting the VAT for each 
grant affected.  
 if it does not intend to submit revised financial statement , but disagree s with 
the proposed correction rate , the beneficiary may :  
 for cost rejection : present an alternative correction method  
(alternative  correction rate) , substantiated by an audit performed by an 
independent external auditor  
The purpose of the independent audit can ONLY be to determine a more 
precise error rate for the audit/review findings of th e 
Commission/Agency ( NOT to contest those findings themselves ).  
 for grant reduction : present an alternative correction method  
(alternative flat rate) , substantiated by  a note explaining why the 
alternative rate is more appropriate  than the rate proposed  by the 
Commission/Agency.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the extension procedure is completed, the list of grants and beneficiary position is handed to 
the operational services  which  are in charge of managing the concerned grants . They will decide 
on the actions to be taken in their grants .    
The implementation will be done on the basis of the:  
 The beneficiary must choose one method for the entire extension procedure, i.e. 
submit for all grants either revised financial statements or an alternative correction 
method.   
 The Commission/Agency has full discretion  to accept or refuse the alternative 
correction method  proposed by the beneficiary; there is NO entitlement to it.

ARTICLE  23 — EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Evaluations  
The Commission/Agency may carry out interim  and final evaluations  of the actions for the 
monitori ng and evaluation of the H2020 Programme implementation.  
 
 
They are based on the performance indicators and issues specified in Annexes II and III to the 
H2020 Specific Programme.  These performance indicators vary according to the specific 
programme’s objectives.  Performance indicators may be refined during the implementation of 
H2020.  
Example:  
Progress on the Specific Objective ’Leadership in enabling and  industrial technologies’ is evaluated on the 
basis of the three following indicators:  
 patent applications and patents awarded in the different enabling and industrial technologies,  
 share of participating firms introducing innovations new to the company or  the market 
(covering the period of the project plus three years),  
 number of joint public -private publications.  
The necessary information will normally be taken from the questionnaire (that must be filled out 
as part of the periodic reports). However, the Commission/Agency may also address specific 
information requests to the coordinator (or the other beneficiaries).  
 
  These  evaluations have NO effect on the grant.  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 23 — EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACTION  
23.1 Right to evaluate the impact of the action  
The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out interim and final evaluations of the impact of the action 
measured against the objective of the [EU][Euratom]  programme.  
Evaluations ma y be started during implementation of the action and up to [OPTION 1 by default:  
five][ OPTION 2 for low value grants: three] years after the payment of the balance. The evaluation is 
considered to start on the date of the formal notification to the coordin ator or beneficiaries.  
The [Agency or the] Commission may make these evaluations directly (using its own staff) or indirectly 
(using external bodies or persons it has authorised to do so).  
The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relev ant to evaluate the impact of the action, 
including information in electronic format.  
23.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the [Commission] [Agency]  may apply the 
measures described in Chap ter 6.

1. Code of Practice  
Beneficiaries that are universities or other public research organisations must take measures to 
implement  the principles set out the Code of Practice47 annexed to the EU Recommendation on 
the management of intellectual property in knowledge transfer activities.  
 
 
 
The Code consists of a set of general principles aiming to improve IP management and 
knowledge transfer by  public research organisations by promoting  exploitation and 
dissemination of research results  (— with Point 1 : Principles for an internal intellectual 
property policy  and Point 2: Principles for a knowledge transfer policy )

SUBSECTION 2  RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO 
BACKGROUND  
ARTICLE 24 — AGREEMENT ON BACKGROUND  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Agreement on background  
The beneficiaries must identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action  (in 
order to be able to give access to it).  
Best practice:  Although not obligatory, beneficiaries are strongly advised to agree on 
background before the GA is signed , to ensure that they have access rights to what is needed 
for implementing the action (and then exploiting its results).  
‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know -how, information or 
rights — that exists before the GA is signe d and that is needed to implement the action or to 
exploit its results.  
Examples:  prototypes; cell lines; patents; database rights  
For intellectual property rights, it suffices that the application was filed before the GA is 
signed. ( ‘Intellectual property ’ being understood in the meaning defined in Article 2 of the 
Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation , signed at Stockholm 
on 14 July 196748). 
Backgro und is not limited to input owned, but potentially extends to anything the 
beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub -licence) . It also 
extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s organisation.

ARTICLE 24 — AGREEMENT ON BACKGROUND  
24.1 Agreement on background  
The beneficiaries must identify and agree (in writing) on the background for the action ( ‘agreement on 
background ’).  
‘Background ’ means any data, know -how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or 
intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that:  
(a) is held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement, and  
(b) is needed to implement the action or exploit the results.  
24.2 24.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligation s under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ).  
 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 2 > Article 24  233 Example:  if a university department participates in the action, background could potentially be 
anything held by the university (unless the department has its own legal personality and is the 
beneficiary)  
The agreement may take any form  (e.g. positive list, negative lis t). It may be a separate 
agreement or may be part of the consortium agreement (see Article 41 ). 
If access to background is subject to  legal restrictions  or limits , the beneficiary must inform the 
other beneficiaries — before signing the GA  (see Article 25 ). 
Example:  Beneficiaries may agree to exclude specific background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to 
permit the adequate protection of the background before  providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one 
or more specific beneficiaries ). As background is by definition considered to be needed for implementation or 
exploitation, the impact of such exclusion  on the action, particularly regarding an exclusion which does not have 
a temp orary character, should be examined by the beneficiaries .

 ARTICLE 25 — ACCESS RIGHTS TO BACKGROUND  
25.1 Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access  rights — No sub -licensing  
To exercise access rights, this must first be requested in writing ( ‘request for access ’).  
‘Access rights ’ means rights to use results or background under the terms and conditions laid down in this 
Agreement.  
Waivers of access r ights are not valid unless in writing.  
Unless agreed otherwise, access rights do not include the right to sub -license.  
25.2 Access rights for other beneficiaries, for implementing their own tasks under the action  
The beneficiaries must give each other acc ess — on a royalty -free basis — to background needed to 
implement their own tasks under the action, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has — before 
acceding to the Agreement —: 
(a) informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is  subject to legal restrictions or 
limits, including those imposed by the rights of third parties (including personnel), or  
(b) agreed with the other beneficiaries that access would not be on a royalty -free basis.   
25.3 Access rights for other beneficiaries, f or exploiting their own results  
The beneficiaries must give each other access — under fair and reasonable conditions —  to background 
needed for exploiting their own results, unless the beneficiary that holds the background has — before 
acceding to the Agr eement — informed the other beneficiaries that access to its background is subject to 
legal restrictions or limits, including those imposed by the rights of third parties (including personnel).  
‘Fair and reasonable conditions ’ means appropriate conditions,  including possible financial terms or 
royalty -free conditions, taking into account the specific circumstances of the request for access, for example 
the actual or potential value of the results or background to which access is requested and/or the scope, 
duration or other characteristics of the exploitation envisaged.  
Requests for access may be made — unless agreed otherwise — up to one year after the period set out in 
Article 3.  
25.4 Access rights for affiliated entities  
Unless otherwise agreed in the consortium agreement, access to background must also be given — under 
fair and reasonable conditions (see above; Article 25.3) and unless it is subject to legal restrictions or limits, 
including those imposed by the rights of third parties (including perso nnel) — to affiliated entities45 
established in an EU Member State or ‘associated country ’46, if this is needed to exploit the results 
generated by the beneficiaries to which they are affiliated.  
Unless agreed otherwise (see above; Article 25.1), the affil iated entity concerned must make the request  
directly to the beneficiary that holds the background.  
Requests for access may be made — unless agreed otherwise — up to one year after the period set out in 
Article 3.

1. Access to background  
The rules on access to background  (including conditions and scope of access) are generally the 
same as for results (see Article 31 ). 
However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access,  if there ar e 
restrictions or limits  (legal or otherwise ) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before 
acceding to the GA (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).  
Example:  A pre -existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of access 
rights  
By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it  must ensure that it  can comply 
with its access obligations under the GA.  
Moreover, the conditions for access  are slightly different. Access must be given:  
 for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty -free  
However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the GA is signed, for background other 
conditions may apply.  25.5 Access rights for third parties  
[OPTION 1 for trans -national access to research infrastructure:  The access provider must — unless it is 
subject to legal restrictions or limits, including those imposed by the rights of third parties (including 
personnel) — give users royalty -free access to background needed to implement the action.  
The access provider must inform the users as soon as possible of any restriction which might substantially 
affect the granting of access rights .] 
[OPTION 2: Not applicable ] 
25.6 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
45 For the definition, , see Article 2.1(2) Rules for Participation Regulation No  1290/2013 : ‘affiliated entity ’ means any legal entity that is:  
- under t he direct or indirect control of a participant, or  
- under the same direct or indirect control as the participant, or  
- directly or indirectly controlling a participant.  
‘Control’ may take any of the following forms:  
(a) the direct or indirect holding of mor e than 50% of the nominal value of the issued share capital in the legal entity concerned, 
or of a majority of the voting rights of the shareholders or associates of that entity;  
(b) the direct or indirect holding, in fact or in law, of decision -making powers in the legal entity concerned.  
However, the following relationships between legal entities shall not in themselves constitute controlling relationships:  
(a) the same public investment corporation, institutional investor or venture -capital company has a direct or indirect holding of 
more than 50% of the nominal value of the issued share capital or a majority of voting rights of the shareholders or associat es; 
  (b)   the legal entities concerned are owned or supervised by the same public body . 
46 For the definition, see Article 2.1(3) Rules for Participation Regulation No  1290/2013 : ‘associated country ’ means a non EU -country 
(third country) which is party  to an international agreement with the Union, as identified in [OPTION 1 for EU grants:  Article 7 of the 
H2020 Framework Programme Regulation No 1291/2013 . Article 7 sets out the conditions for association of non -EU countries to 
Horizon 2020. ][OPTION 2 fo r Euratom grants:  Article 5 of Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1314/2013 of 16 December 2013 on the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2014 -2018) complementing the Horizon 2020 – The 
Framework Programme for Research an d Innovation (‘ H2020 Euratom Research and Training Programme Regulation No 
1314/2013 ’) (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 948 . Article 5 sets out the conditions for association of non -EU countries to Horizon 2020.]  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 2 > Article 25  236 Example:  A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiar ies for implementing their 
tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same level of background.  In such 
case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel technology to implement the action will not 
be on a royalty -free basi s. 
Best practice:  If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is recommended that 
this is explained in detail in their proposal.  
 for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions (see Article 31 ). 
Also, there are NO specific access rights  for EU institutions, Member States, Euratom, joint 
undertakings or third parties  — except for the option for  royalty -free access for users of research 
infrastructures  in actions with  trans-national or virtual access  to research infrastructure.  
Access rights are therefore normally limited to other beneficiaries and  certain  affiliated entities of 
other beneficiaries , unless otherwise agreed . 
Example: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results. Beneficiary A would like to 
use its affiliated entity A  established in a MS  to exploit the results. For this, affiliated entity A needs access 
rights to beneficiary B’s background.

 SUBSECTION 3  RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO RESULTS  
ARTICLE 26 — OWNERSHIP OF RESULTS  
26.1 Ownership by the beneficiary that generates the results  
Results are owned by the beneficiary that generates them.  
‘Results ’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action such as data, knowledge or information — 
whatever its form or nature, whethe r it can be protected or not — that is generated in the action, as well as 
any rights attached to it, including intellectual property rights.  
26.2 Joint ownership by several beneficiaries  
Two or more beneficiaries own results jointly if:  
(a) they have jointly generated them and  
(b) it is not possible to:  
(i) establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or  
(ii) separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection (see  
Article 27 ). 
The joint owners  must agree (in writing) on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership 
(‘joint ownership agreement ’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement.  
Unless otherwise agreed in the joint ownership agreement, each joint owner may grant non -exclusive 
licences to third parties to exploit jointly -owned results (without any right to sub -license), if the other joint 
owners are given:  
(a) at least 45 days advance notice and  
(b) fair and reasonable compensation.  
Once the results have be en generated, joint owners may agree (in writing) to apply another regime  than joint 
ownership (such as, for instance, transfer to a single owner (see  Article 30 ) with access rights for the others).  
26.3 Rights of third parties  (including personnel)  
If third parties (including personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary concerned must ensure 
that it complies with its obligations under the Agreement.  
If a third party generates results, the beneficiary concerned mu st obtain all necessary rights (transfer, 
licences or other) from the third party, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if those results were 
generated by the beneficiary itself.  
If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using the third party to generate the 
results.

1. Ownership of results  
Results  belong  normally to the beneficiary that produced  them.  
 26.4 [EU][Euratom][Agency]  ownership, to protect results  
26.4.1 [The EU][Euratom][The Agency]  may — with the consent of the beneficiary concerned — assume 
ownership of results to protect them, if a beneficiary intends — up to four years after the period set out in 
Article 3 — to disseminate its results without protecting them, except in any of the  following cases:  
(a) the lack of protection is because protecting the results is not possible, reasonable or justified (given 
the circumstances);  
(b) the lack of protection is because there is a lack of potential for commercial or industrial 
exploitation, or  
(c) the beneficiary intends to transfer the results to another beneficiary or third party established in an 
EU Member State or associated country, which will protect them.  
Before the results are disseminated and unless any of the cases above under Points (a), (b) or (c) applies, the 
beneficiary must formally notify the  [Commission] [Agency] and at the same time inform it of any reasons 
for refusing consent. The beneficiary may refuse consent only if it can show that its legitimate interests 
would suffer significant harm.  
If the [Commission] [Agency]  decides to assume ownership, it will formally notify the beneficiary 
concerned within 45 days of receiving notification.  
No dissemination relating to these results may take place before the end of this period or, if the 
[Commission][Agency]  takes a positive decision, until it has taken the necessary steps to protect the results.  
26.4.2 [The EU][Euratom][The Agency]  may — with the consent of the beneficiary concerned — assume 
ownership of results to protect them, if a benefi ciary intends — up to four years after the period set out in 
Article 3 — to stop protecting them or not to seek an extension of protection, except in any of the following 
cases:  
(a) the protection is stopped because of a lack of potential for commercial or ind ustrial exploitation;  
(b) an extension would not be justified given the circumstances.  
A beneficiary that intends to stop protecting results or not seek an extension must — unless any of the cases 
above under Points (a) or (b) applies — formally notify the [Commission][Agency]  at least 60 days before 
the protection lapses or its extension is no longer possible and at the same time inform it of any reasons for 
refusing consent. The beneficiary may refuse consent only if it can show that its legitimate interests would 
suffer significant harm.  
If the [Commission][Agency]  decides to assume ownership, it will formally notify the beneficiary 
concerned within 45 days of receiving notification.  
26.5 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to the any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > A rticle 26  239 ‘Results’ means the action’s tangible outputs (e.g. prototypes, micro -organisms) and intangible 
outputs (e.g. know -how, formulas),  as well as related rights ( e.g. patent rights and database 
rights ). Results  do not include the outputs of activities not described in Annex 1, produced 
before the action starts, during its course or after it ends.  
 
 
 
 
Specific cases  (ownership of results) : 
Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not possible to 
establish their respective contribution (or to separate them for protection), the b eneficiaries 
automatically become joint owners .  
In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must c onclude a joint ownership agreement  (in writing).  
This agreement should cover in particular:  
 specific conditions for granting licenses (if they are different from those already set out in 
the GA)  
 criteria or principles for ‘fair and reasonable compensatio n’ to be provided to the other joint 
owners, if a non -exclusive license is granted to a third party (if appropriate)  
A ceiling for fair and reasonable compensation  should be fixed only if  the expected results 
can be determine d with precision already before  the action starts .  
 how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc .). 
Best practice:  To make it easier to negotiate a joint -ownership agreement, the beneficiaries should  include 
general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium agreement.  
The joint ownership agreement will usually require further fine -tuning after the jointly -owned 
results are produced, in particular with regard to:  
 how the ownership is divi ded (e.g. equally or not)  
 if and how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of 
protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state -of-the-art 
searches, infringement actions, etc.) , or to the sharing of revenues or profits  
 how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.   
The joint owners automatically have the right under the GA to grant non -exclusive licenses  to third 
parties against fair and reasonable compensation (without prior au thorisation from the other joint 
owners ) — unless otherwise provided  in the joint ownership agreement.  
The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at least 45 days  
advance notice  (together with sufficient information , to check if the proposed compensation is fair 
and reasonable). Such licenses may not include sub -licensing.  Joint owners are free to agree on 
different arrangements in their joint -ownership agreement.  
Joint owners may abandon joint ownership only after t he jointly -owned results have been produced  (
 
new in Horizon 2020 ). 
Example:  Once the results have been produced, the joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner 
and agree on more favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart)   
Joint ownership by agreement  — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries may also 
become  joint owners if they specifically agree on it.  
Example:  A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent company 
or another third party. However, this requires a (partial) transfer of ownership, which is subject to the GA’s 
rules on transferring ownership.   
EU/Euratom/Agency ownership to protect results — If valuable results are not protected (e.g. if 
the official pros ecution or renewal fees for a patent application are not paid ), the Commission/Agency 
may — under certain circumstances — assume ownership of the results.  
 
 
 Record -keeping  
Best practice:  To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents such 
as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 26  240 2. Third parties with rights on results  
The beneficiaries must ensure that they can fulfil their obligations under the GA  regarding results , 
by making arrangements  with any third parties  that could claim rights to the m (e.g. 
subcontractors, linked third parties , international partners,  employees, etc.).  
Examples (third parties that may claim rights):  academic institutions in countries that have a kind of 
‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the results of university 
research); employees or students who carry out work for the action  (if they have rights  under national law or 
their contract) ; beneficiaries for which linked third parties carry out a significant part of the work.  
Examples (arrangements):  transferring ownership to the beneficiary; granting access rights to the beneficiary 
with a right to sub -license.  
 
Specific cases  (third parties with rights on results) : 
Joint research units ( JRUs)  — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU  (see Article 14 ), state that 
any results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, these other members are third 
parties that can claim rights on the results. In this case, the JRU member that is the beneficiary must 
ensure that it can fulfil its contractua l obligations under the GA (e.g. with regard to other beneficiaries’ 
access rights) .  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries that are members of a JRU should inform the other beneficiaries as 
soon as possible, to give them time to make, if needed, appropriate arrang ements in the 
consortium agreement.

ARTICLE 27 — PROTECTION OF RESULTS — VISIBILITY OF  EU FUNDING  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Protection of results  
The beneficiaries must — for any results that can reasonably be expected to be commercially or 
industrially exploited —: 
– examine the possibility of protecting them and  
– if possible, reasonable and justified, protect  them  
even if this requires further research and development or private investment.  
Example  (no protection necessary):  if protection i s impossible under EU or national law or not justified 
(in view of the (potential) commercial or industrial exploitation, the action’s objective and other relevant 
elements, such as potential markets and countries in which competitors are loc ated, whether additionally 
protecting a part of certain technology would bring significantly broader protection or not, etc. )  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should consider seeking expert advice to help them decide whether 
and how to protect results.  
This obligation also applies to beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see Article 9 ). ARTICLE 27 — PROTECTION OF RESULTS — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
27.1 Obligation to protect the results  
Each beneficiary must examine the possibility of protecting its results and must adequately protect them — 
for an appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage — if: 
(a) the results can reasonably be expected to be commercially or industrially exploited and  
(b) protecting them is possible, reasona ble and justified (given the circumstances).  
When deciding on protection, the beneficiary must consider its own legitimate interests and the legitimate 
interests (especially commercial) of the other beneficiaries.  
27.2 [EU][Euratom][Agency]  ownership, to protect the results  
If a beneficiary intends not to protect its results, to stop protecting them or not seek an extension of 
protection, [the EU][Euratom][the Agency]  may — under certain conditions (see  Article  26.4) — assume 
ownership to ensure their (continued) protection.  
27.3 Information on EU funding  
Applications for protection of results (including patent applications) filed by or on behalf of a beneficiary 
must — unless the [Commission][Agency]  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible  — include 
the following:  
“The project leading to this application has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 
research and innovation programme][Euratom research and training program me 2014 -2018]  under grant 
agreement No [number] ”. 
27.4 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43 ). 
Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures describ ed in Chapter 6 . 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 27  242 The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form  of protection.  
Standard  forms of protection:  
 Patent  
 Trademark  
 Industrial design  
 Copyright  
 Trade -secret  
 Confidentiality  
The choice of the most suitable form should be made on the basis of the specificities of the 
action and the type of result (i.e. the form which offers the most adequate and effective 
protection). Although impor tant for commercial and industrial exploitation,  IP protection is 
not mandatory.  
Examples (choice according to the type of result):  
1. For an invention: e.g. patent, confidential information.  
2. For the design of a technology: e.g. industrial design, copyright.  
3. For a website: e.g. industrial design, copyright, trademark.  
In some cases, it may be advisable to protect the invention by keeping it confidential, or to 
postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.  
Example  (better not to pro tect for the moment) : Keeping an invention temporarily confidential 
could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative consequences associated 
with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication, possible r ejection due to lack of 
support or industrial applicability, etc.) . 
Costs related to protection  may be eligible  (see Article 6.2.D.3 ). 
When deciding on protection, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries ’ 
legitimate interests .  
Any other beneficiary invoking legitimate interests must show how the decision would 
significantly harm it (especially commercially).   
Example (harm):  The protection would lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held by the 
other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential).  
Best practice:  Although a beneficiary is not required to consult the other beneficiaries before 
deciding whether to protect a specific result it owns, beneficiaries can f oresee arrangements 
(either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure that decisions on 
protection take due account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned.  
Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage  (in 
view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential markets 
and countries in which potential competitors are located) . Patent applications should identify the 
rightful in ventors . Errors (or fraud) in identifying inventors may lead to the invalidation of 
patents .  
Example (not rightful inventor):  an entity systematically designates a head of department as one of the 
inventors, although it is not true.  
2. Visibility of EU fu nding  
Applications for protection must include the reference to EU funding  set out in the GA  — unless  
(technically or legally) impossible  (see Article 38 ).  
Best practice:  Where possible, beneficiaries  should  make this reference in the language of the ir 
application  (using the text of the GA language version available on Funding & Tenders Portal 
Reference Documents ).

1. Exploitation of results  
The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure exploitatio n of their results  — either by 
themselves ( e.g. for further research or for commercial or industrial exploitation in its own 
activities ) or by others (other beneficiaries or third parties, e.g. through licensing or by 
transferring the ownership of results ). 
 
 
 
  This is a best effort obligation : The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific measures to 
ensure that their results are used (to the extent possible and justified).   
 ARTICLE 28 — EXPLOITATION OF RESULTS  
28.1 Obligation to exploit the results  
Each beneficiary must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — take measures aiming to 
ensure ‘ exploitation ’ of its results (either directly or indirectly, in particular through transfer or licensing; 
see Article 30 ) by: 
(a) using them in further research activities (outside the action);  
(b) developing, creating or marketing a product or process;  
(c) creating and providing a service, or  
(d) using them in standardisation activities.  
[OPTION for additional exploitation obligatio ns if foreseen in the work programme:  In addition, the 
beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — comply with the additional 
exploitation obligations set out in Annex 1.] 
This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply.  
28.2 Results that could contribute to European or international standards — Information on EU 
funding  
[OPTION for results that could contribute to standards if foreseen in the work programme: If results 
could reasonably be ex pected to contribute to European or international standards, the beneficiary 
concerned must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — inform the 
[Commission][Agency]. ] 
If results are incorporated in a standard, the beneficiary concerned must — unless the 
[Commission][Agency]  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible — ask the standardisation 
body to include the following statement in (information related to ) the standard:  
"Results incorporated in this standard received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and 
innovation programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014 -2018]  under grant agreement No [Number] ". 
28.3 Consequences of n on-compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced in accordance 
with Article 43 . 
Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H202 0 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  244 The obligation applies only to beneficiaries receiving EU funding (see Article 9 ). 
Where possible, the measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the action 
and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination o f the results.  
If the GA provides for additional exploitation obligations , these must also be fulfilled. (Such 
additional exploitation obligations wi ll already be mentioned in the w ork programme /call.)  
 
 
 
If the GA includes the option for information on standardisation , the beneficiaries must 
moreover inform the Commission/Agency on any results that could contribute to European or 
international stand ards.  
Example:  The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as in mobile 
communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).  
  Additional exploitation obligations apply to ALL beneficiaries .

 ARTICLE 29 —  DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS — OPEN ACCESS — VISIBILITY OF EU 
FUNDING  
29.1 Obligation to disseminate results  
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, each beneficiary must — as soon as possible  — 
‘disseminate ’ its results by disclosing them to the public by appropriate means (other than those resulting 
from protecting or exploiting the results), including in scientific publications (in any medium).  
[OPTION for additional dissemination obligations if foreseen in the work progra mme:  In addition, the 
beneficiaries must comply with the additional dissemination obligations set out in Annex 1.] 
[OPTION for additional dissemination obligations for interoperability if foreseen in the work 
programme:  Moreover, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — 
disseminate any technical specifications of the results that are needed for interoperability. ] 
[OPTION for additional dissemination obligations for cross -border interoperability if foreseen in the 
work programme:  Moreover, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 
— disseminate the deliverables relating to cross -border interoperability (see Annex 1) and any results 
needed for cross -border interoperability (in parti cular common technical specifications and software 
components). ] 
This does not change the obligation to protect results  in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in 
Article 36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect perso nal data in Article 39, all 
of which still apply.  
A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give advance notice to the other beneficiaries of — 
unless agreed otherwise — at least 45 days, together with sufficient information on the results  it will 
disseminate.  
Any other beneficiary may object within — unless agreed otherwise — 30 days of receiving notification, if 
it can show that its legitimate interests in relation to the results or background would be significantly 
harmed. In such cases,  the dissemination may not take place unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard 
these legitimate interests.  
If a beneficiary intends not to protect its results, it may — under certain conditions (see  Article 26.4.1 ) — 
need to formally notify the [Commission][Agency]  before dissemination takes place . 
29.2 Open access  to scientific publications  
Each beneficiary must ensure open access (free of charge, online access for any user) to all peer -reviewed 
scientific publications relating to its results.  
In particular, it must:  
(a) as soon as possible and at the latest on publication, deposit a machine -readable electronic copy of 
the published version or final peer -reviewed manuscript accepted for publication in a repository for 
scientific publications;  
Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data needed to validate 
the results presented in the deposited scientific publications.  
(b) ensure open access to the deposited publication — via the repository — at the latest:  
 
(i) on publication, if an electronic version is available for free via the publisher, or  
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA

 (ii) within six months of publication (twelve months for publications in the social sciences and 
humanities) in any other case.  
(c) ensure open access — via the repository — to the bibliographic metadata that identify the deposited 
publication.  
The bibliographic metadata must be in a standard format and must include all of the following:  
- the terms ["Europ ean Union (EU)" and "Horizon 2020"]["Euratom" and Euratom research 
and training programme 2014 -2018’];  
- the name of the action, acronym and grant number;  
- the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable, and  
- a persistent identifier.  
29.3 Open access to research data  
[OPTION 1a for actions participating in the open Research Data Pilot : Regarding the digital research 
data generated in the action ( ‘data’), the beneficiaries must:  
(a) deposit in a research data repository and take measures to make it possible for third parties to 
access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate — free of charge for any user — the following:  
(i) the data, including associated metadata, needed to validate the  results presented in 
scientific publications as soon as possible;  
(ii) [OPTION A for health actions that participate in the Open Research Data Pilot, if 
foreseen in the work programme: data which is relevant for addressing a public health 
emergency , if specifi cally requested by the [Commission][Agency] and within the deadline 
specified in the request] [OPTION B : not applicable];  
(iii) other data, including associated metadata, as specified and within the deadlines laid down 
in the ‘ data management plan ’ (see Annex 1); 
(b) provide information — via the repository — about tools and instruments at the disposal of the 
beneficiaries and necessary for validating the results (and — where possible — provide the tools 
and instruments themselves).  
This does not change the obligation  to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all of 
which still apply.  
As an exception, the beneficiaries do not have to ensure open access to specific parts of their research data 
under Point (a)(i) and (iii), if the achievement of the action’s main objective (as described in Annex 1) 
would be jeopardised by making those specific parts of the research data openly accessible . In this case, the 
data management plan must contain the reasons for not giving access.  
[additional OPTION for health actions that participate in the Open Research Data Pilot, if foreseen in 
the work programme: As an exception, the beneficiaries do not ha ve to ensure open access also to the 
research data under Point (a)(ii), if the [Commission][Agency] agrees to replace the open access obligation 
by special access rights for third parties that need the data to address the public health emergency. These 
access rights must include the right to access, mine, exploit and reproduce the data free of charge.] ] 
[OPTION 1b for health actions that do NOT participate in the Open Research Data Pilot, if foreseen in 
the work programme: The [Commission][Agency] may requi re beneficiaries to:  
(a) deposit digital research data, which is generated in the action and relevant for addressing a public 
health emergency, in a research data repository and take measures to make it possible for third 
parties to access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate the data free of charge for any user  
or

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  247  
 (b) give specific access rights to third parties that need the digital research data to address the public 
health emergency (including the right to access, mine, exploit ad reproduce the data free of charge)  
within the deadline specified in the [Commission][Agency]’s request.  
This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
36, the security oblig ations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all of 
which still apply.  
[OPTION 1c for health actions targeting public health emergencies, if foreseen in the work programme: 
The beneficiaries must deposit the digital research data generated in the action in a research data 
repository and take measures to make it possible for third parties to access, mine, exploit, reproduce and 
disseminate the data free of charge for any user, at the latest within 30 days after it has been generated.  
This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all of 
which still apply.  
As an exception, the beneficiaries do not have to ensure open access, if the [Commission][Agency] agrees to 
replace the open access obligation by special access rights for third parties that need the data to address the 
public health emergency. These acce ss rights must include the right to access, mine, exploit and reproduce 
the data free of charge. ] 
[OPTION 2 : Not applicable ] 
29.4 Information on EU funding  — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem  
Unless the [Commission][Agency]  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any dissemination 
of results (in any form, including electronic) must:  
(a) display the EU emblem and  
(b) include the following text:  
“This project has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014 -2018] under grant agreement No [Number] ”. 
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
For the purp oses of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
first obtaining approval from the [Commission][Agency] . 
This does not however give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU embl em or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
or by any other means.  
29.5 Disclaimer excluding [Commission][Agency]  responsibility  
Any dissemination of results must indicate that it reflects only the author’s view and that the 
[Commission][Agency]  is not responsible for any use that may be made of the information it contains.  
29.6 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43 ). 
Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  248 
 
1. Dissemination of results  
Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, t he beneficiaries must — as soon as possible (but 
not before a decision on their possible protection)  — disseminate  their results (i.e. make them 
public).  
Results that are disclosed too early (i.e. before the decision on their protection) run the risk 
being invalidated.  
Example:  If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e -mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference) before  
filing for protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or confidentiality obligations 
(typically someone from an organisation outside th e consortium).  
NO dissemination at all may take place, if:  
 the results need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know -how) or  
 dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the GA (e.g. personal data 
protection, security obligations, etc .). 
 
The beneficiaries may choose the form  for disseminating  their results.  
Standard  forms of dissemination:  
 website  
 presentation at a scientific conference  
 peer-reviewed publication  
The dissemination measures should however be consistent with the ‘plan for the exploitation 
and dissemination of the results’ and proportionate to the impact expected from the action.  
When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’  
legitimate interests .  
The beneficiary that intends to disseminate must give the other beneficiaries  — unless 
otherwise agreed — at least 45 days  advance notice  (together with sufficient information on 
the dissemination ). 
Any other beneficiary may object  to dissemination  — unless otherwise agreed — within 30 
days of receiving notification , if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to 
backg round or results). In this case, the results may not be disseminated  — unless 
appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake.  
Examples (significant harm):  Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable background 
held by an other beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another beneficiary’s results more 
difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or postponing dissemination until the results 
are protected.  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should  foresee arrangements (either in the consortium agree ment 
or in separate agreements)  to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due account of the 
 Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/ NOT possible for  results that are subject to 
limited disclosure/dissemination  in Annex 1 of the GA  (see Article 37 ). 
 Results  that contain EU-classified information , can be disclosed only after approval by the 
Commission/Agency (see Article 37 ).  
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classified information 
in EU research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  249 interests of all beneficiaries concerned  (and yet allow for publication of results without 
unreason able delay).  
If the GA provides for additional dissemination obligations , these must also be fulfilled. Such 
additional dissemination obligations will already be mentioned in the work programme/call.  
 
 
 
2. Open access to scientific publications  
What?  Beneficiaries must ensure open, free -of-charge access  to the end -user to peer-
reviewed scientific publications  relating to their results.  
‘Peer-reviewed publications’ means publications that have been evaluated by other scholars 
(e.g. articles in scientific journals) .  
 
 
 
 
The requirement of Horizon 2020 for open access  does NOT imply that the beneficiaries are 
obliged  to publish  their results; it only sets requirements that must be fulfilled if they do decide to 
publish them.  
Open access means ensuring that, at the very least, such publications can be read online , 
downloaded  and printed  — via a repository for scientific publications , a publication platform or 
publisher site . 
Best practice:  In order to increase the utility of the publication, beneficiaries are encouraged 
to provide additional rights , such as the right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl and mine.  
Beneficiaries /authors are encouraged to retain copyright and grant appropriate licences to 
publishers. They are  encouraged to use Creative Commons (CC) or similar licenses. CC BY is a 
good legal tool for providing open access in its broadest sense.  
Open access can be provided through:  
a) publishing  in open access  (‘gold’  open access ) ‘ 
Publishing in open access ’ means that open access is provided immediately via the 
publication venues , at the time that  an article is published (i.e. in open access 
journals /platforms  or in ‘hybrid’ journals combining subscription access and open access to 
individual articles ). 
Some publishers levy author processing charges for open access publishing . These costs 
are eligible (see Article 6.2.D.3 ), if incurred before the end of the action  and if all other 
eligibility conditions are fulfilled .  
 
 
 
b) self-archiving ( ‘green’ open access ) ‘ 
 Other types of scientific publications, such as no n-peer-reviewed articles as well as  monographs, 
books, conference proceedings and ‘grey literature’ (i.e. informally published material not having gone 
through a standard  publishing process, e.g. reports ), are not covered by th e open access obligation.  
Best practice:  However,  to ensure  fuller and wider access , beneficiaries are encouraged to provide 
open access  also to these other types of scientific publications (where possible ). 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Although publishing  in open access already ensures access via the publisher, the beneficiaries must 
still deposit their publication in  a repository  (see below) , in order to ensure the long -term preservation 
and availability of the publication.  This is part of the open access requirement.  
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 For more guida nce on dissemination and exploitation, see the  Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  250 Self-archiving ’ means that the published article or the final peer -reviewed manuscript is 
archived by the researcher (or a representative ) in a repository  and made available in 
open access through that repository .  
A ‘repository for scientific publications’ is an online archive, where researchers deposit research 
publications, research data and other scientific outputs and can  provide open access to them. 
Repositories help preserve, manage and provide access to scientific outputs. They collect and 
disseminate digital research outputs from individual research organisations  (institutional 
repositories, e.g. the repository of University X ) or specific research communities 
(thematic/disciplinary repositories, e.g. Europe PMC  for life sciences including biomedicine and 
health or arXiv for physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative  biology,  quantitative 
finance and  statistics ). They can also be centralised repositories, such as for example Zenodo , 
developed by CERN . 
 Best practice: Identify the repository that suits  your need in the  Directory of Open Access 
Repositories ( OpenDOAR ). The Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe ( OpenAIRE ) 
can help you to find such repositories. W e recommend that you use a repository that is 
compliant with the requirements of OpenAIRE  and that you use the OpenAIRE database  as a 
point of departure. OpenAIRE also offers support services for researchers, by providing 
information on open access requirement s, a general  Helpdes k and country -specific helpdesks 
(National Open Access Desks) that answer questions on open access and Horizon 2020 .  
Beneficiaries without institutional /thematic repositories may deposit their publications in Zenodo , at no 
cost to them . 
Beneficiaries should NOT use a repository with rules which could conflict with open access.  
A template for an open access clause  addendum which can be added to publishing 
agreements  to enable open access through self -archiving in repositories is available on the 
Funding & Tenders  Portal.  
How?  Open access to scientific publications involves four actions : 
1) Deposit , in a repository for scientific publications, a machine -readable electronic copy of 
the published version of the publication  (or the final peer -reviewed manuscript as 
accepted for publication , author’s version ).  
This must be done at the latest on publication  (in some cases, the final version can be 
deposited before publication, e.g. once accepted by the journal ).  
‘Machine readable copy’ means a format that can be used and understood by a computer; 
copies must be stored using text file formats t hat are either standardised or otherwise 
publicly known, so that anyone can develop new tools for working with them.  
Best practice: Where possible, the article as published  (in terms of layout, pagination, 
etc.) should be deposited.  
2)  Provide open access  to the scientific publication  — either via open access  publishing  (i.e. 
via the publication venue  AND via the repository) or as self-archiving  (i.e. via the repository 
only).   
Open access must be given:  
 in case of ‘open access  publishing ’: at the latest on publication  
 in all other cases: within 6 months (12 months for publications in the social sciences 
and humanities)  
3)  Ensure open access , via the repository, to certain bibliographic metadata that identify 
the publication  
This is needed for visibility, traceability and monitoring.  
It must be done in a standard format and include:  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  251  the terms ‘European Union (EU)’ and ‘Horizon 2020’ or ‘Euratom’ and ‘Euratom 
research and training programme 2014 -18’ (depending on the grant)  
 the name of the action, acronym and grant number  
 the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable and  
 a persistent identifier (e.g. a stable digital object identifier which identifies the 
publication and links to an authoritative version) .  
Best practice:  For ease of tracking, beneficiaries should also include the digital object 
identifier for ‘Horizon 2020 ’ (http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601 ) in the 
funding acknowledgement field i n their metadata.   
The metadata compliance of the repository can be checked using OpenAIRE . 
4)  Aim to  deposit  at the same time  with action 1 , ideally in a data repository, the research 
data needed to validate the results in the deposited publication.  
This is linked to rapid evolution of the concept of ‘publication’ in the digital era. The 
underlying data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications is now 
seen as a cru cial part of the publication and therefore an important element of scientific 
best practice.  
 
 
 
 
 
3. Open access  to research data ( Extended Open Research Data  Pilot ) 
What?  Beneficiaries of actions that participate in the  Open Research Data  Pilot (ORDP) must: 
 develop a data management plan (DMP)  as a deliverable of the project and   
 give open,  free-of-charge access to the end -user to  digital research data generated 
during the action.   
The purpose of the ORDP is therefore twofold: research data management and open access.  
 
Open access to digital research data means taking measures to make it possible for end-users  to 
access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate  the data via a research data repository  
without any charges for them. 
 For more guidance on  open access, see the  Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
 Benefic iaries  do NOT have  to grant open access to the deposited underlying research data  — 
unless they are participating i n the Pilot on Open Research Data (see below) . 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As of the Work Programme 2017, the Open Research Data pilot has been extended to all thematic 
areas of Horizon 2020 (except ERC PoC actions, SME instrument Ph1 actions, ERA -NET Cofund actions 
that do not produce data, EJ P Cofund actions, and prizes).   
Participation is therefore now in principle the default . However, actions may opt out  at any stage — 
both before  signing the GA and afterwards (through an amendment ; see Article 55 ) —, if: 
- participation is incompatible with the obligation to protect results (see Article 27 )  
- participation is incompatible with the security obligations (see Article 37 )  
- participation is incompatible wit h rules on protection of personal data  
- participation would mean that the project's main aim might not be achieved  
- the project will not generate/collect any research data or  
- there are other legitimate reasons not to take part.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  252 ‘Digital research data’ are information in digital form (in particular facts or numbers), collected 
to be examined and used as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation; this includes 
statistics, results of experiments, measurements, observations resulting from fieldwork, 
survey results, interview recordings and images.  
Only data that are generated by beneficiaries in the course of the action or reused  digitally in 
the action  are concerned. Actions are encouraged to digitise any other data and provide open 
access to them, but they are not obliged to do so.  
The pilot applies to 2 types  of digital research data: 
 the data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications and 
associated metadata (i.e. data describing the deposited research data) and  
 other data  an d associated metadata, as specified by the beneficiaries themselves in 
their data management plan.  
Examples:  curated data not directly attributable to a publication or raw data  
 
 
 
 
 
 
A ‘research data repository’ means an online archive for research data; this can be subject -
based/thematic, institutional or centralised.  
Best practice:  Useful listings of repositories include the Registry of Research Data Repositories 
(Re3data ) and the Core Trust Seal  certified repositories . One key entry point for acce ssing and 
depositing related data and tools is Zenodo . For further details on general and discipline -specific 
repositories visit the EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure .   
Actions participating in the pilot must moreover develop  a data management plan (DMP)  as a 
deliverable of the project within the first 6 months of the project implementation.  
The DMP must support the management life -cycle for all data that will be collected, processed 
or generated by the action. It must cover how to make data findable, accessible, interoperable 
and re-usable (FAIR), including : 
 the handling of data during and after the project  
 what data will  be generat ed or reused  
 what methodology and standards will be applied  
 whether  data will be shared /  made  open access  (and how ) and, if any, what data will 
not be shared / made open access (and why)  and 
 how data will be curated and preserved.  
The DMP should  be updated ( and become  more precis e) as the project  evolves . New versions 
should be created whenever important changes to the project occur (e.g. new data sets, 
changes in consortium policies , etc.), at least as part of the mid -term review  (if any) and at  
the end of the project.  
Best practice:  FAIRsharing  provides a curated and searchable portal of data standards, 
databases, and policies in the life sciences and other scientific disciplines. For more 
information on disciplinary metadata standards , visit Digital Curation Centre  and Research 
Data Alliance Metadata Directory . Additional info rmation on DMPs, repositories and the 
FAIR principles can be found in this Practical Guide . 
 
 Beneficiaries particip ating in the ORPD should  NOT provide open access to specific datasets  if this 
would go against other GA obligations (e.g. to protect results or personal data)  or if the action’s main 
objective, as described in Annex 1, would be jeopardised by giving open access to those specific 
datasets. In this case, the reasons  must be explained in the data management plan,  which is a 
deliverable for projects participating i n the ORDP, see below ). 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  253  
 
Costs relat ed to the implementation of the  ORDP  (e.g. costs for providing open access, related 
research data  management  costs, data curation and data storage  costs) are eligible  if incurred 
before the end of the action and if all the other eligibility conditions are fulfilled  (see Article 
6.2.D.3 ).  
How? Open access to digital research data involves 3 actions:  
1) Develop a  data management plan (DMP)  by month six  of the project as a deliverable. 
The DMP is a ‘living document’ to be revised as appropriate in the duration of the project   
2) Deposit  the digital research data, preferably in a research data repository.  
3) Provide  open access  by taking measures to enable users to access, mine, exploit, 
reproduce and disseminate the data free of charge (e.g. for databases: by attaching a n 
appropriate  creative commons licence ( CC-BY or CC0 tool ) to the data ; if the access/use is 
not subject to any rights : by indicating that no licence is needed ). 
Open access must not necessarily be given immediately; for data needed to  validate the 
results pr esented in scientific publications, as soon as possible; for other data, beneficiaries 
are free to specify embargo periods for their data in the data management plan  (as 
appropriate in their scientific area).  
4) Provide  information , via the repository, about tools and instruments for validating the 
results.  
Where possible, the beneficiaries should provide those tools and instruments (e.g. 
specialised software or software code, algorithms, analysis protocols, etc.).  
 
 
 
4. Data sharing for public health emergenc ies 
If foreseen in the work programme /call, grant agreements for health actions will include specific 
contractual provisions concerning the sharing of research data for public health emergenc ies.  
Public health emergen cies are for instance :  
 public health emergencies of international concern ( ‘PHEIC ’) according to the World 
Health Organisation, or  
 public health emergencies under Decision 1082/2013/EU, or  
 public health emergencies under applicable national frameworks and regulations.   
What?  The data -sharing obligations for public health emergenc ies refer to any type of quality -
controlled digital research data (see point 3) and associated metadata which is generated in the 
action and is relevant for the response to the public health emergency.  
Personal data must be processed in accordance with applicable EU and national law (including  
international practices and standards ; see Article 39.2 ). 
For H2020 actions targeting  public health  emergencies , the beneficiaries must  moreover : 
 provide  a data management plan (DMP) preferably with the proposal or at the latest before 
grant  signature  
The data management plan  should address the relevant aspects of making the data 
findable, accessible, interoperable and re -usable  (FAIR) , including : 
 For more guidance on data management plans (and a template) , see also the H2020 p roposal 
forms and the  Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
 
 For more guidance on the research data pilot, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .  
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29  254  what data the project will generate  
 whether and how the data will be made accessible for verification and  re-use and  
 how it will be circulated and preserved.  
 
 
 for relevant data  (as agreed with  the Commission/Agency) : provide open  access within 30 
days after it has been generated  
 for other  data: provide  open access as soon as possible . 
If agreed with the Commission/Agency, the open access obligation can  exceptionally  be 
replaced by special access rights to specific third parties that need the data to address the 
public health emergency.  
In this case, the access rights must include the right to access, mine, exploit and reproduce 
the data free of charge (as further specified by the Commission/Agency, if needed) — but they 
may be used only for the access needed and only for addressing the public health emergency 
(i.e. limited both in scope and in time). Sub -licensing is only allowed if  the beneficiary agrees.  
For other H2020 actions, the special open access obligation  (or the special access rights to specific 
third parties ) is linked  to a specific  request  by the Commission/Agency and limited to datasets 
agreed with the Commission/Agency .  
 
5. Visibility of EU funding  
Any dissemination of results (in any form) , even when combined with other data, must include the 
reference to EU funding  set out  in the GA  (see Article 38 ).  
Best practice:  Where possible, beneficiaries should make this reference in the language of the 
dissemination activity  (using the text of the GA language version available on Funding & Tenders 
Portal Reference Documents ). 
Do NOT refer to EU funding when describing outputs of activities that are not described in Annex I, 
i.e. outputs developed outside the action (in other words for d issemination activities which do not 
concern results of the action).  
 
 
 
 Combining H2020 & other EU grants  — If the outputs were developed in another EU -funded 
action (funded not by H2020 , but another EU programme , including Structural Funds /ESIF Funds ), do 
NOT forget the visibility obligations under those grant agreements.

 ARTICLE 30 — TRANSFER AND LICENSING OF RESULTS  
30.1 Transfer of ownership  
Each beneficiary may transfer ownership of its results.  
It must however ensure that its obligations under Articles 26.2, 26.4, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 also apply to the 
new owner and that this owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer.  
This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply.  
Unless agreed otherwise (in writing) for specifically -identified third parties or unless impossible under 
applicable EU and national laws on mergers and acquisitions, a beneficiary that intends to trans fer 
ownership of results must give at least 45 days advance notice (or less if agreed in writing) to the other 
beneficiaries that still have (or still may request) access rights to the results. This notification must include 
sufficient information on the n ew owner to enable any beneficiary concerned to assess the effects on its 
access rights.  
Unless agreed otherwise (in writing) for specifically -identified third parties, any other beneficiary may 
object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if a greed in writing), if it can show that the transfer 
would adversely affect its access rights. In this case, the transfer may not take place until agreement has been 
reached between the beneficiaries concerned.  
30.2 Granting licences  
Each beneficiary may gr ant licences to its results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), if:  
(a) this does not impede the access rights under Article 31 and  
(b) [OPTION 1 if additional exploitation obligations in Annex 1: the beneficiary complies with its 
additional exploitatio n obligations (see  Article 28.1  and Annex 1)] [OPTION 2: not applicable ]. 
In addition to Points (a) and (b), exclusive licences for results may be granted only if all the other 
beneficiaries concerned have waived their access rights (see  Article 31.1 ). 
This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29 or security obligations in Article 37, which 
still apply.  
30.3 [Commission][ Agency]  right to object to transfers or licensing  
[OPTION 1 for EU grants: The [Commission][Agency] may — up to four years after the period set out in 
Article 3 — object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results, if:  
(a) it is to a third party established in a non -EU country not associated with Horizon 2020 and  
(b) the [Commission][Agency] considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests 
regarding competitiveness or is inconsistent with ethical principles or security considerations.  
A beneficiary that intends to  transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally notify the 
[Commission][Agency] before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:  
 
- identify the specific results concerned;  
 
- describe in detail the new owner or licensee and the planned or potential exploitation of the results, 
and 
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU competitiveness 
and its consistency with ethical principles and security considerations.

(a) it is to a third party established in a non -EU country not associated to the Euratom research and 
training programme 2014 -2018, and  
(b) the Commission considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with the EU interests regarding 
competitiveness or is inconsistent with ethical principles or security considerations.  
Security considerations include the defence interests of the Member States under Article 24 of the Euratom 
Treaty.  
A beneficiary tha t intends to transfer ownership or grant a licence must formally notify the Commission 
before the intended transfer or licensing takes place and:  
- identify the specific results concerned;  
- describe in detail the results, the new owner or licensee and the pla nned or potential exploitation of 
the results, and  
- include a reasoned assessment of the likely impact of the transfer or licence on EU competitiveness 
and its consistency with ethical principles and security considerations.  
The Commission may request additional information.  
If the Commission decides to object to a transfer or licence, it will formally notify the beneficiary concerned 
within 60 days of receiving notification (or any additional information requested).  
No transfer or licensing may take pl ace in the following cases:  
 pending the Commission decision, within the period set out above;  
 if the Commission objects;  
 until the conditions are complied with, if the Commission objection comes with conditions ] 
[OPTION 3: Not applicable ] 
30.4 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 30  257 
 
1. Transfers of ownership  
The beneficiaries may transfer ownership  of their results . 
 
 
 
 
The beneficiaries must however ensure that their obligations  (regarding the results) apply to the 
new owner  and that this new owner would pass them on in any subsequent transfer (e.g. by 
including this in their arrangements with the new owner) . 
Obligations that must be extended to new owners:  
 Joint ownership -related obligations (see Article 26.2 )  
 EU/Euratom/Agency’s right to assume ownership, to protect results  (see Article 26.4) 
 Protection of results and visibility of EU funding  (see Article 27) 
 Exploitation of results and visibility of EU funding (see Article 28) 
 Dissemination of results, open access and visibility of EU funding  (see Article 29 )  
 Transfer and licensing of results (see Article 30 ) 
 Access rights to result (see Article 31 ). 
When transferring ownership, they must also consider the other beneficiaries’  legitimate 
interests . 
The beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries (that still 
have or still may request access rights) at least 45 days  (or less if agreed in writing) 
advance notice  (together with sufficient information  to allow them to p roperly assess the 
extent to which their access rights may be affected).  
Any other beneficiary (with such access rights) may object  to the transfer  within 30 days  (or 
less if agreed in writing) of receiving notification , if it can show that it would advers ely affect 
its access rights. In this case, the transfer may not take place, until the beneficiaries 
concerned reach an agreement.  
The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a 
valid reason for an objection. Th e beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse 
effects on the exercise of its access rights.  
Example (adverse effect):  Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it created 
during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that its access 
rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the competitor has a 
proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims), the transfer may not 
take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement.  
 
Specific cases  (transfers of ownership of results) : 
Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an ‘intended’ 
transfer) but part of a take -over or merger of two companies, confidentiality constraints normally 
prevail (under  M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the other beneficiaries only after 
the merger/acquisition took place (instead of before ). 
 Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are  subject to 
limited disclosure/dissemination  in Annex 1 of the GA  (see Article 37 ). 
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classified 
information in EU research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual . 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 30  258 Specifically -identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement) waive 
their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically -identified third party (e.g. the mother 
company or an affiliate of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform the m of suc h transfers 
in advance (and they do not have the right to object).  
Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries  should carefully consider the situation (and 
in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their access rights would be 
affected.  
Example:  For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results produced will be 
transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other beneficiaries (who agreed to 
the global authorisation).  
In security -related actions, transfers to third parties should only be decided on a case -by-case basis and 
should be handled with the greatest caution.  
If the Commission/Agency has the right to object to transfers (see point 3) , the beneficiary must 
formally notify  in advance (via the Funding & Tenders Portal ) any transfer to a specifically -identified 
third party established in a non-associa ted third country — and the Commission/Agency may object.  
Joint research units ( JRUs)  — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any results 
produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is the beneficiary 
must ensure that it complies with the obligations under the GA on transfers (placing results under joint 
ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer).  
Common legal structures — Common legal structures (CLS) (i.e. entities representing several other 
legal entitie s, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations ) that are beneficiaries 
of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members. This is not prohibited; 
however the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access righ ts have to remain available) . 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly advised to 
agree on specific arrangements with the other members of the CLS, in particular relating to 
ownership and access rights.  
 
2. Granting licences  
The beneficiaries may grant licences  to their results.  
They must however ensure that access rights can be exercised and that any additional 
exploitation obligations  are complied with.  
Exclusive  licences (e.g. for commercial exploitation)  may be granted only if all other 
beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other  access rights  are preserved, (e.g. the 
access rights  of the EU, Member States and third parties ; see Article 31 ). 
 
3. Commission/Agency right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing  
If the GA provides for this option , the Commission/Agency may object  to transfers or exclusive  
licences  (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive  licences) to third parties established in a non-
associated third country . 
 
 
 
 As of the Work Programme 2018 , the calls will normally already indicate if this option will be activated 
in the GAs.  The option may however still be activated ( without such indication ):  
 for calls which do not fix the type of research and innovation activities (“bottom -up” calls, such 
as FET Open or MSCA) or  
 in other calls, exceptionally, if justified by the nature of the research and innovation activities or 
other action -related reasons.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 30  259 Grounds for objection : 
 Planned transfer /licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests   
Example:  if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for European 
companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and reasonable conditions in 
the EU  
 Planned transfer /licence not consistent with ethical principles  
Example:  if the transfer or license could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in 
accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and international 
level 
 Planned transfer/ licence not consistent with security consi derations  (including, for 
Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the Euratom 
Treaty).  
Example:  if the transfer or licence could make results considered significant from a security 
standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security -sensitive results could fall into the hands of 
third parties that are considered a security risk  
This right doe s NOT apply to results generated by beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see 
Article 9 ). 
The beneficiary must formally  notify the C ommission/Agency in advance  (via the Funding & 
Tenders Portal ) of any planned transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any 
non-exclusive licence).   
A notification before the results  are generated is allowed , if the specific results concerned (and 
the details of the transfer/licence)  can already be identified.

 ARTICLE 31 — ACCESS RIGHTS TO RESULTS  
31.1 Exercise of access rights — Waiving of access rights — No sub -licensing  
The conditions set out in Article 25.1 apply.  
The obligations set out in this Article do not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still a pply.  
31.2 Access rights for other beneficiaries, for implementing their own tasks under the action  
The beneficiaries must give each other access — on a royalty -free basis — to results needed for 
implementing their own tasks under the action.  
31.3 Access r ights for other beneficiaries, for exploiting their own results  
The beneficiaries must give each other — under fair and reasonable conditions (see  Article 25.3 ) — access 
to results needed for exploiting their own results.    
Requests for access may be made — unless agreed otherwise — up to one year after the period set out in 
Article 3.  
31.4 Access rights of affiliated entities  
Unless agreed otherwise in the consortium agreement, access to results must also be given — under fa ir and 
reasonable conditions (Article 25.3) — to affiliated entities established in an EU Member State or 
associated country, if this is needed for those entities to exploit the results generated by the beneficiaries to 
which they are affiliated.  
Unless ag reed otherwise (see above; Article 31.1), the affiliated entity concerned must make any such 
request directly to the beneficiary that owns the results.  
Requests for access may be made — unless agreed otherwise — up to one year after the period set out in 
Article 3.  
31.5 Access rights for the EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and EU Member States  
[OPTION 1 by default for EU grants : The beneficiaries must give access to their results — on a royalty -
free basis — to EU institutions, bodies, offices o r agencies, for developing, implementing or monitoring EU 
policies or programmes.  
Such access rights are limited to non -commercial and non -competitive use.  
This does not change the right to use any material, document or information received from the benefi ciaries 
for communication and publicising activities (see  Article 38.2 ).] 
[OPTION 2 for calls under Specific Objective ‘Secure societies — Protecting freedom and security of 
Europe and its citizens ’: The b eneficiaries must give access to their results — on a royalty -free basis — to 
EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies as well as EU Member States’ national authorities, necessary 
for developing, implementing or monitoring their policies or programmes  in this area.  
 
Such access rights are limited to non -commercial and non -competitive use.  
Access is conditional on an agreement to define specific conditions ensuring that:  
(a) the access will be used only for the intended purpose and  
(b)  appropriate confidential ity obligations are in place.

1. Access to results  
What & When ? The beneficiaries must provide access to results , if it is needed:  
 by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results  
 by an affiliated entity of another beneficiary (established in a EU Member State or H2020 
associated country), to exploit the results produced by the benefic iary to which it is 
affiliated — unless otherwise provided for in the consortium agreement.  The requesting EU Member State or EU institution, body, office or agency must inform all other EU 
Member States of such a request.  
This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply. ] 
[OPTION 3 for Euratom grants: The beneficiaries must give access to their results — on a royalty -free 
basis — to the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and its joint undertakings, for developing, 
implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes or for compliance with obligations 
assumed through international cooperation with third countries and international organisations.  
As an exception to Article 31.1, such access rights include the right to authorise third part ies to use the 
results in public procurement and the right to sublicense and are limited to non -commercial and non -
competitive use. ] 
31.6 Access rights for third parties  
[OPTION 1a for additional access rights for complementary grants if foreseen in the wo rk programme : 
The b eneficiaries must give — under the conditions set out in Article 31.2 and 31.3 — access to their 
results to complementary beneficiaries47, for the purposes of the complementary grant agreement(s) (see  
Article  2).] 
[OPTION 1b for additional access rights for interoperability if foreseen in the work programme:  The 
beneficiaries must give third parties — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 and [ OPTION 
A: under fair and reasonable conditions (see Article 25.3 )][OPTION B: on a royalty -free basis] — access 
to their results needed for interoperability. ] 
[OPTION 1c for additional access rights for cross -border interoperability if f oreseen in the work 
programme:  The b eneficiaries must give third parties — up to four years after the period set out in Article 
3 and on a royalty -free basis — access to their results needed for interoperability, in particular for 
implementing the results in EU Member States or associated countries that are not participating in the 
action.  
Beneficiaries must give access to software components under an EU public licence (or compatible licences) 
and must comply with any additional requirements set out in in A nnex 1.] 
[OPTION 1d for trans -national access to research infrastructure:  The access provider must give the users 
royalty -free access to the results needed to implement the action. ] 
[OPTION 2: Not applicable ] 
31.7 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
47 'Complementary beneficiary’ means a  beneficiary of a complementary grant agreement  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
40 ‘Complementary beneficiary ’ means a beneficiary of a complementary grant agreement.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 31  262 There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the results  has to assess (on a case 
by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the requesting beneficiary 
needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).  
Example (results needed for implementation) : if without these results, action t asks could not be 
implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional financial or human 
resources.  
Example (background needed for exploitation) : if without these results, exploiting a result would 
be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would have to be carried out 
outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution.  
Best practice:  To avoid conflicts, beneficiaries should  agree (e.g. in the consortium 
agreement)  on a common interpretation  of what is needed.  
The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights , provided that such a waiver  is made in 
writing.  
Best practice:  Waivers should be made only on a case -by-case basis, once the results have been 
correctly i dentified, and should not be broader than what is actually necessary.  
Examples:  
1. If a waiver is made to allow for an exclusive licence, this waiver should not be broader than what is 
required for the purpose of the licence (regarding application fields, geographical coverage, etc.).  
2. If a waiver is made to allow for an exclusive lic ence, it may be wise that the beneficiaries agree that the 
waiver will lapse, if the license is not granted within a certain period or if the results concerned are not 
exploited by the licensee within a certain period.  
How?  Access rights are not automatic ; they must be requested  (in writing).  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries may use their internal rules to specify how to make such written 
requests.  
It may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action  before the end, under the 
same conditions as from active participants.  
For affiliated entities (established in a EU Member State or H2020 associated country), access 
must be requested directly from the beneficiary owning the results. However, the benefici ary 
owning the results may agree to a different arrangement.  
Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after t he period set out in 
Article 3  — unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.  
The agreement  by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in any 
form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral).  
In case of disagreement , the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request, withdraw 
it or resort to the co nflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium ( e.g. in the consortium 
agreement ).  
If a conflict on access rights to results is likely to affect the action implementation, the 
beneficiaries must immediately  inform  the Commission/Agency (see Article 17.2 ). 
 
2. Conditions for access: Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions  
Access must be given:  
 for the implementation of action tasks: royalty -free  
 for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable cond itions  
‘Fair and reasonable conditions’ means appropriate conditions, including possible financial 
terms (i.e. monetary compensation), non -financial terms  or royalty -free conditions, taking 
into account the specific terms  of the  granted access.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 31  263 Fair and r easonable conditions includes also royalty -free conditions (
  new in Horizon 
2020).  
Examples (monetary compensation): a lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination of 
both. 
Examples (non -financial terms): a requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to agree 
on cooperation in a different field or in a future project.  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries must agree on what constitutes fair and reasonable conditions, 
preferably in writing.  
Royalty fees paid for access  may be eligible costs  (see Article 6.2.D.3 ). 
 
3. Scope of access: Sublicen sing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More 
favourable terms — Additional conditions  
The access rights set out in the GA cover  only the access  needed . 
Access rights do NOT automatically give the right to the requesting beneficiary to sub-
licence . (If this were the case, access rights to results would be extended — without consent 
— to virtually any company in the world, including the beneficiary’s competitors).  
Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such 
agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the 
sub-licensing does not have to be royalty -free (even if the access rights concerned are) 
and can itself be made subject to specific conditions.  
Examples:  
1. A university may need the right to sub -license access to results to third parties, to make it possible 
to derive value from its own results.  
2. In large industrial groups i t is quite common that research is conducted by one affiliate and 
exploitation by one or several other affiliates. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research affiliate’ but not by 
the ‘exploitation affiliate(s)’ would raise problems for them.  
Best practice:  The beneficiaries should  agree on the terms and conditions of the sub -
licensing generally and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately).  
Examples:  In such an agreement, they could foresee that  sub-licensing could apply to the results  
(or part of them), but not to the background; sub -licensing could apply to affiliates of (some of) 
the beneficiaries, but not to other third parties.  
The beneficiaries remain free to grant licenses (including quasi -exclusive licenses) to their  own 
results , as long as they can guarantee that all the access rights can be exercised. They can even 
grant an exclusive licence, if the other beneficiaries have waived their access rights.  
Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access  rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen in 
the GA.  
Examples:  Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities not established in an EU Member 
State or H2020 associated country).  
Best practice:  Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in a 
separate agreement.  
Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub -licence)  or 
be made subject to additional conditions  (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations) .  
Exampl e: 
The beneficiary owning the results agrees that another beneficiary may sublicense its access rights to results to 
its affiliated entity.  
Best practice:  For legal certainty, beneficiaries should  to specify these terms or conditions in 
writing . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 31  264 Once obtained, access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries  
(e.g. until the patent expires) . 
 
4. Specific access rights for EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and EU 
Member States  
If the GA provides for this option, EU institutions, bodies, offices or a gencies and/or EU Member 
States have  specific access rights for policy purposes.  
 
5. Specific access rights for Euratom and its joint undertakings  
If the GA provides for this option, Euratom and its joint undertakings  (such as the Fusion for 
Energy  joint undertaking ) have royalty -free access, for:  
 developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes  
 complying with Euratom’s obligations under international research and cooperation 
agreements in the fi eld of nuclear energy.  
These access rights include the right to sub-license  (e.g. to third parties involved in such an 
international agreements)  or to give the results for use in public procurement, as long as they 
are only used for non -commercial and non -competitive purposes.  
Example:  
Euratom is part of the ITER agreement and is committed to disseminating information on technological 
solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a non -discriminatory basis with 
other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and ITER members royalty -free licences, 
including the right to sub -license, for the intellectual property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor 
fusion and research programmes.  
 
6. Specific access r ights for third parties  
If the GA provides for this option, there are specific access rights for third parties, i.e.:  
 for beneficiaries of complementary grants (depending on the case, royalty -free or under 
fair and reasonable conditions)  
The additional a ccess rights to results for complementary grant agreements apply ONLY if 
(and to the extent that) the access is needed for the purposes of the complementary grant 
(i.e. the access is needed for implementing the action tasks under the complementary 
grant or  for exploiting the results of the beneficiaries in the complementary grant ). 
 for third parties that need it for (cross -border) interoperability (depending on the case, 
royalty -free or under fair and reasonable conditions)  
 for users of a research infrastructure in actions with trans -national or virtual access  to 
research infrastructure under Article 16  (royalty -free).  
These  access rights are limited to the research work of the user under the grant (i.e. what 
he needs fo r his research work while he uses the research infrastructure).

2. Recruitment , working conditions and career development — Rights for the 
researchers  
The beneficiaries must in particular implement the General Principles and Requirements of the 
Charter51 and of the Code of Conduct52 that relate to recruitment , working conditions and career 
development . 
List of principles  (relating to working conditions):  
 Recruitment  
 Transparency  
 Judging merit  
 Selection  
 Variations in the chronological order of CVs  
 Recognition of mobility experience  
 Recognition of qualifications  
 Seniority  
 Postdoctoral appointments  
According to these principles, beneficiaries should have a clear policy  for recruiting  and 
selecting researchers , which is publicly available and ensures that:  
 all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publically advertised (e.g. via 
the EURAXESS Jobs Portal53) 
 vacancies and funding op portunities are also published in English  
 vacancy announcements include a clear job description  
 vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding 
opportun ity, and the selection criteria  
 there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for 
applications  
 there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and 
role of members, inclusion of experts from other (foreign) institutions, gender 
balance)  
 adequate feedback is given to applicants  
 there is a complaint mechanism  
 the selection criteria adequately value mobility, qualifications and experience, 
including qualifications and experience obtained in non -standard or informal ways.  
These principles also apply to selection procedure s that do not lead to formal 
employment relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship) .

ARTICLE 33 — GENDER EQUALITY  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Gender equality — Equal opportunities  
The beneficiaries must aim — to the extent possible — for a gender balance at all levels of 
personnel assigned to the action, including at the supervisory and managerial levels . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Examples (measures to promote equal opportunities):  transparency of recruitment and advancement 
processes, including gender -sensitive language in vacancies and job -descriptions; plans and conditions for 
career advancement; transparent wage classification and grading of jobs;  development of leadership 
opportunities; gender planning and budgeting; gender impact assessment of new policies; climate surv eys 
of institutions; adoption of family -friendly policies; promotion of mobility and dual -career couples.  
If a beneficiary cannot achieve the balanced participation of women and men in its team despite 
active recruitment efforts, the reasons should moreove r be explained  in the first periodic 
technical  report  and in the final report  (see Articles 20.3  and 20.4). 
The Commission/Agency will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action 
implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 22 ). 
 
 
 
 
  This is a best effort obligation : The b eneficiaries must:  
 aim for the balanced participation of women and men in their research teams  
 be proactive in ensuring gender balance among the individuals who are primarily responsible for 
carrying out the work (in accordance with the categories defined in the monitoring system) . 
 Record -keeping — Beneficiaries should keep appropriate documentation  about the steps taken and 
measures put in place  (see Article 18 ). ARTICLE 33 — GENDER EQUALITY  
33.1 Obligation to aim for gender equality  
The beneficiaries must take all measures to promote equal opportunities  between men and women in the 
implementation of the action. They must aim, to the extent possible, for a gender balance at all levels of 
personnel assigned to the action, including at supervisory and managerial level.  
33.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches its obligations under this Article, the [Commission] [Agency]  may apply any of the

 ARTICLE 34 — ETHICS AND RESEARCH INTEGRITY  
34.1 Obligation to comply with ethical and research integrity principles  
The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with:  
(a) ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity ) 
and 
(b)  applicable international, EU and national law.  
Funding will not be granted for  activities carried out outside the EU  if they are prohibited in all Member 
State s or for activities which destroy human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).   
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action have an exclusive focus on civil 
applications . 
The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities u nder the action do not:  
(a) aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes;  
(b) intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes heritable 
(with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be financed), 
or 
(c) intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell 
procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer.  
In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity — as set out in 
the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity49. 
This implies notably compliance with the following fundamental principles:  
- reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, t he analysis 
and the use of resources;  
- honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a 
transparent, fair and unbiased way;  
- respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the  
environment ; 
- accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organization, for 
training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts  
and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research task s follow the good research 
practices and refrain from the research integrity violations described in this Code.  
This does not change the other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable 
international, EU or national law, all of which  still apply.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Art icle 34  270  
 
1. Ethical principles  
The b eneficiaries must carry out the action  in compliance with : 
 ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and 
 applicable international, EU and national law.  
Main  ethical principles:  
 Respecting human dignity and integrity  
 Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably getting free and 
informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant)  
 Protecting vulnerable perso ns 
 Ensuring privacy and confidentiality  
 Promoting justice and inclusiveness  
 Minimising harm and maximising benefit  
 Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research is being 
carried out in developing countries  34.2 Activities raising ethical issues  
Activities raising ethical issues  must comply with the ‘ethics requirements ’ set out as deliverables in 
Annex 1.  
Before the beginning of an activity raising an ethical issue, each beneficiary must have obtained:  
(a) any ethics committee opinion required under national law and  
(b) any notification or authorisation for activities raising ethical issues required under national and/or 
European law  
needed for implementing the action tasks in question.  
The documents must be kept o n file and be submitted upon request by the coordinator to the 
[Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52). If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an 
English summary, which shows that the action tasks in question are covered and include s the conclusions of 
the committee or authority concerned (if available).  
34.3 Activities involving human embryos or human embryonic stem cells   
Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out, in 
addition to Article 34.1, only if:  
-  they are set out in Annex 1 or  
- the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see 
Article 52 ). 
34.4 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches  any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ) 
and the Agreement or participation of the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 50 ). 
Such breaches may also  lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 34  271  Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and refinement 
(‘3Rs’) in animal research  
 Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations  
The key source s of EU and international law  are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of  the 
European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols  (for 
other texts ). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (UN CRPD).  
Compliance to the ethical principles and legisla tion is ensured by the H2020 ethics appraisal 
scheme  (i.e. the H2020 policy  on ethics issues  in research ), which includes all of the following:  
 ethics self-assessment (by the applicants, in their proposal)  
 two-stage ethics review, with an ethics screening and, if necessary, an ethics assessment 
(by the Commission/Agency, during the selection procedure)  
 if necessary, ethics checks, reviews and audits (during the implementation of the action 
and up to two years afterwards; see Article 22 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Activities carried out outside the EU  
Activities carried out in a non -EU country  must comply  with the law s of that country  AND be 
allowed  in at least one EU Member State.  
 
The beneficiaries must confirm  in the ethics self -assessment section of their proposal  that this 
condition  is met.  
 
3. Exclusive focus on civil applications  
Activities under the action must have a n exclusive focus on civil applications . 
This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military context . 
Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian purposes but with 
possible military applications) is not prohibited . However, activities that focus on military 
applications will NOT be funded.  
 
4. Research integrity  
In order to ensure the necessary level of research integrity , the b eneficiaries must follow  
principles listed in this Article  and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks comply with  
the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity54 (i.e. follow the good research practices 
listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it describes ). 
Fundamental  research integrity principles:  
 reliability  in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the 
analysis and the use of resources

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 34  272  honesty  in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a 
transparent, fair and unbiased way  
 respect  for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the 
environment  
 accountability  for the research from the idea to publication, for its management and 
organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts.  
The Code constitutes a general reference framework and takes into account  the legitimate 
interests of the beneficiaries  (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing) .  
This does not change the other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable 
international, EU or national law, all of which still apply.  In addition, beneficiaries should rely on 
local, national o r discipline -specific guidelines, if such documents exist and are not contrary to the 
Code.  
The detailed research integrity obligations were introduced with GA version 3.0. For older grant 
agreements, these obligations were however already implicitly incl uded in Article 34 (which 
already provided for the more general obligation to comply with the highest standards of research 
integrity and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity ).  
 
5. Activities raising ethic s issues  
If the ethics review (carried out by the Commission/Agency during the selection procedure) 
identifies an ethics issue, the Commission/Agency will define ethics requirements  and include 
them as deliverables in Annex 1  of the GA . 
Examples (ethics issues):  involvement of patients , volunteers, children or vulnerable populations; use of 
human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting and processing of personal data; 
use of animals; risk of environmental impact; risk of malevolent use or misuse of resear ch results . 
Examples (ethics deliverables):  to submit to the Commission/Agency a report on certain ethics issues 
during the course of the action . 
Other ethics requirements  may have been required already before GA signature.  
Examples (other ethics requirements):  confirmation that the research data of this study will not be 
transferred outside the EU.  
In addition , the beneficiary must obtain — before the start of the activity  for which it is needed  — 
all the necessary  ethics opinions , notifications  and authorisations  (e.g. to ethics committees, 
data protection authorities, dual -use authorities, etc.).  
Best practice:  When preparing the applications for such opinion s/notifications/  authorisations , 
beneficiaries should request the assistance of ethics experts, research ethics 
departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer (DPO).  
 
 Record -keeping — The documents no longer need to be submitted before the start of the action, but 
the beneficiary must keep the m on file and provide  them on  request to the Commission/Agency (e.g. in 
case of  ethics reviews,  checks or audits ; see Article 18 ). 
The beneficiary must be able to show that the opinions /authorisations /notifications cover the tasks to 
be undertaken in the c ontext of the action.  
If the documents are not in English, the beneficiary  may be asked to provide  an English summary.  
This summary should show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the action activities 
and should include conclusions, recom mendations and, if applicable, conditions imposed (e.g. the 
use of animals is authorised but limited to a certain number) .  
Translation costs may ( exceptionally ) be charged to the action (see Article 6.2.D.3 ) — at the rate 
of non -official translations.  

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 34  273 The Commission/Agency may carry out ethics checks, reviews or audits , to ensure that the 
beneficiaries have properly implemented the ethics requirements  and obtained the 
opinions/notifications/authorisations  (see Article 22 ). 
 
6. Activities involving human embryos  (hE) or human embryonic stem cells  (hESC)  
Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only be 
funded, if:  
 they comply with the Statement of the European Commission related to research activities 
involving human embryonic stem cells55 (in particular, do NOT result in the destruction of 
human embryos)  
and 
 they are set out in Annex 1 or  
 the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the Commission/Agency.  
These activities rais e ethics issues and must comply with the rules above (and in particular the 
ethics requirements set out in Annex 1 ; see point 5).

ARTICLE 35 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Conflict s of interests  
The b eneficiaries must ensure that the action is implemented impartially and objectively, as 
described in the GA. They must do their best to avoid conflicts of interest.  
A ‘conflict of interests ’ exists if shared interests : 
 influenced the contract’s/subcontract’s selection/award procedure  
 influenced the contract’s/subcontract’s price and this does not correspond to the 
market price or  
 affected the action’s per formance, as measured by the appropriate quality standards.  
These interests may be:  
 economic interests (e.g. unjustified and preferential contracts or subcontracts 
with connected com panies (not based on best value  for money, technical merit, 
etc.)) 
Examples:  
1. A beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity at above the market prices because it is 
a shareholder or has economic interests in this other legal entity.  
2. A university subcontracts work to a consultancy firm owned by a professor c arrying out part of 
the work for the project in which the university participates.  
3. A university gives a preferential subcontract to its spin -off company: the contract is not based 
on the best  value  for money principle (i.e. the price is higher than the general market price for the 
same type of service).  
 political or national affinity  (e.g. beneficiaries or third parties are chosen, or 
research -related decisions are adopted, based on political considerations, 
connections or national affinity)  ARTICLE 35 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS  
35.1 Obligation to avoid a conflict of interests  
The beneficiaries must take all measures to prevent any situation where the impartial and objective 
implementation of the action is compromised for reasons involving economic interest, political or national 
affin ity, family or emotional ties or any other shared interest (‘ conflict of interests ’). 
They must formally notify to the [Commission] [Agency] without delay any situation constituting or likely 
to lead to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation.  
The [Commission] [Agency]  may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional 
measures to be taken by a specified deadline.  
35.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches an y of its obligations under this Article,  the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ) 
and the Agreement or participation of the beneficiary may be terminated (see  Article 50 ). 
Such breaches may also le ad to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 35  275 Example:  The choice of an action’s demonstration site is based on national affinities, not on the 
site’s merits . 
 family or emotional ties  (e.g. contracts or subcontracts made with family 
members for their benefit)  
Example:  A husband works for a beneficiary who sub contracts work to an SME owned by his wife.  
 other shared interests . 
Examples:  
1. If a beneficiary or third party participates in the action not because of its technical capacity and 
objective merits, but because it has a close relationship with someone els e working for the action, 
and this affects the action’s implementation.  
2. If decisions made in the context of the action are taken not according to objective and impartial 
criteria, but because of these shared interests.  
3. If entities with close ties cre ate a professional relationship with the intention of being part of the 
action in order to satisfy other interests, and as a result, the quality of the implementation is (or is 
likely to be) compromised.  
If there is a (risk of) a conflict of interests , the  coordinator  must inform the 
Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal ), so that steps can be taken to resolve or 
avoid it.  
This may result in the Commission/Agency putting in place certain measures.

 ARTICLE 36 — CONFIDENTIALITY  
36.1 General obligation to maintain confidentiality  
During implementation of the action and for four years after the period set out in Article 3,  the parties must 
keep confidential any data, documents or other material ( in any form) that is identified as confidential at the 
time it is disclosed (‘confidential information ’). 
If a beneficiary requests,  the [Commission] [Agency]  may agree to keep such information confidential for an 
additional period beyond the initial four years.  
If information has been identified as confidential only orally, it will be considered to be confidential only if 
this is confi rmed in writing within 15 days of the oral disclosure.  
Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use confidential information only to implement the 
Agreement.  
The beneficiaries may disclose confidential information to their personnel or third p arties involved in the 
action only if they:  
(a) need to know to implement the Agreement and  
(b) are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.  
This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply.  
The [Commission][Agency]  may disclose con fidential information to its staff, other EU institutions and 
bodies. It may disclose confidential information to third parties, if:  
(a) this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU’s financial interests and  
(b) the recipients of the informatio n are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.  
Under  the conditions set out in  Article 4 of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/201350, the 
Commission must moreover make available information on the results to other EU institutions, bodies, 
offices or agencies as well as Member States or associated countries.  
The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if:  
(a) the disclosing party agrees to release the other party;  
(b) the information was already known by the recipient or is given to him without obligation of 
confidentiality by a third party that was not bound by any obligation of confidentiality;  
(c) the recipient proves that the information was developed without the use of confidential information;  
(d) the information becomes generally and publicly avai lable, without breaching any confidentiality 
obligation, or  
(e) the disclosure of the information is required by EU or national law.

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 36  277  
 
 
 
 
 
1. Confidentiality  
The beneficiaries (and also the Commission/Agency)  must — during the action and for four years 
afterwards — keep confidential any data, documents or other material ( in any form) that is 
identified as confidential at the time it is disclosed .  
 
 
 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should inform each other (and the Commission/Agency) about any 
laws that require disclosing confidential information (and to work together to minimise any negative 
effects).  
A beneficiary may ask the Commission/Agency to extend the period. This request must explain 
why a nd clearly identify the confidential information.  
 
The Commission/Agency will exchange confidential information with the European Court of 
Auditors (ECA), the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) and other Agencies and H2020 funding 
bodies, to check double fu nding, pursue fraud and avoid plagiarism. (This is part of safeguarding 
the EU financial interests).  
 This is  a minimum obligation : Beneficiaries may extend the period and agree to additional 
confidentiality -related obligations among themselves (for example, for access rights or third parties involved 
in the action) .  
 36.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 Security obligations  — Stricter confidentiality obligations apply for information that is EU-classified  
or results that are subject to limited disclosure/dissemination  in Annex 1 of the GA  (see Article 37 ). 
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the handling of classified information 
in EU research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .

38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results  
The beneficiaries must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner.  
This does not change the dissemination obligations  in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
36 or the security obligations in Artic le 37, all of which still apply.

For communication activities: “This project has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 
research and innovation programme][Eurat om research and training programme 2014 -2018] under grant 
agreement No [number] ”. 
For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result]  is 
part of a project that has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and 
innovation programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014 -2018] under grant agreement No 
[number]”.  
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
For the purp oses of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
first obtaining approval from the [Commission ][Agency] . 
This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU em blem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
or by any other means.  
38.1.3  Disclaimer excluding [Agency and ] Commission  responsibility  
Any communication activity related to the action must indicate that it reflects only the author’s view a nd 
that the [Agency and the]  Commission [is] [are] not responsible for any use that may be made of the 
information it contains.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 38.1  281 The beneficiaries  must promote the action and its result , with a comprehensive communication 
plan that defines clear objectives (adapted to various relevant target audiences) and sets out a 
concrete planning for the communication activities (including a description and tim ing for each 
activity — throughout the action duration).  
‘Promoting the action’ means providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including 
the media and the public), in a strategic and effective manner  and possibly engaging in a two -
way exchange  
The beneficiaries are free to choose the type of communication activities58. 
Examples:  a press release for the general public at the start of the action; an interview in the local 
radio station after a major achievement of the action; an event in a shopping mall that shows how the 
outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives; organising local workshops about the action, 
targeted at audiences for which the action is of interest; producing a brochure to explain the action’s 
work to school or university students to show how interesting this specific research topic can be.  
The activities must however:  
 be effective (i.e. suited to achieving the action’s communication goals)  
 be proportionate to the scale of the action (e.g. activities carried  out by a large -
scale action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large 
budget must be more ambitious than those of a beneficiary  in a mono -beneficiary 
grant)  
 address audiences that go beyond the action’s own community (includin g the 
media and the public).  
Ad hoc  efforts or mere dissemination of results are NOT sufficient. ( Dissemination of 
results (see Article 29 ) cannot replace communication activities (or vice -versa); both 
provisions must be complied with.)   
Moreover, t he activities  must make the research activities known to multiple audiences  
(in a way that they can be understood by non -specialists) and include  the public policy 
perspective of EU research and innovation funding, by addressing  aspects such as:   
 transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has 
allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible)  
 scientific excellence  
 contributing to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges  
 impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies, 
better quality products, more convenience, improved life -style, etc.)  
 better use of results and spill -over to policy -makers, industry and the scientific 
community.  
Any communication activity that is expe cted to have a major media impact  (i.e. media 
coverage (online and printed press, broadcast media, social media, etc.)  that will go 
beyond having a local impac t and which could have the potential for national and 
international outreach) must be first notified  to the Commission/Agency.  
 
 
 
 
 
                                            
58  For the definition of ‘communication  activities’,  see the Glossary . 
 Security obligations — Information given may NOT include EU-classified information  or 
information on results that  are subject to limited disclosure/dissemination  in Annex 1 of the GA  
(see Article 37 ). 
 For more guidance  on security obligations,  see the Guidelines for the classification of information in 
research projects  and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 38.1  282 The communication activities during the action must already be part of the proposal (either as 
a specific work package for communication or by including them in another work package;  see 
the H2020 p roposal templates ) and be included in Annex 1 and 2.  
 
 
 
 
2. Visibility of EU funding  
The beneficiaries must — during the action and afterwards  — ensure the visibility of EU funding for 
any communication activity related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, 
etc.) and on any infrastructure , equipment or major result  (including prototypes ) funded by the 
grant , by: 
 displaying the EU emblem   
AND 
 including the reference to EU funding  set out  in the GA .  
Best practice:  Where possible, beneficiaries should make this reference in the language of the 
communication activity or, for infrastructure, equipment or major results, the official 
language(s) of the country where they are located  (using the text of the GA language ver sion 
available on  Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents ).  
The EU emblem and reference to EU funding must be displayed in a way that is easily  visible for 
the public and with sufficient prominence (taking also into account the nature of the activity or 
object ). 
Examples:  a sticker or poster for equipment and major results, a plaque or billboard for infrastruct ure.

 38.2 Communication activities by the [Agency and the] Commission  
38.2.1  Right to use beneficiaries’ materials, documents or information  
The [Agency and the]  Commission may use, for its communication and publicising activities, information 
relating to the actio n, documents notably summaries for publication and public deliverables as well as any 
other material, such as pictures or audio -visual material received from any beneficiary (including in 
electronic form).  
This does not change the confidentiality obligati ons in Article 36 and the security obligations in Article 37, 
all of which still apply.  
If the  [Agency’s or the]  Commission's use of these materials, documents or information would risk 
compromising legitimate interests, the beneficiary concerned may request the [Agency or the]  Commission 
not to use it (see  Article 52 ). 
The right to use a beneficiary’s materials, documents and information includes:  
(a) use for its own purposes  (in particular, making them available to persons working for the 
[Agency; the]  Commission or any other EU institution, body, office or agency or body or 
institutions in  EU Member States; and copying or reproducing them in whole or in part, in 
unlimited numbers);  
(b) distribution to the public  (in particular, publication as hard copies and in electronic or digital 
format, publication on the internet, as a downloadable or non -downloadable file, broadcasting by 
any channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or 
inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes);  
(c) editing or redrafting  for communication and publicising activities (i ncluding shortening, 
summarising, inserting other elements (such as meta -data, legends, other graphic, visual, audio or 
text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files), dividing into parts, use in a compilation);   
(d) translation ; 
(e) giving access i n response to individual requests  under Regulation No 1049/200152, without the 
right to reproduce or exploit;  
(f) storage  in paper, electronic or other form;  
(g) archiving , in line with applicable document -management rules, and  
(h) the right to authorise third parties  to act on its behalf or sub -license the modes of use set out in 
Points (b), (c), (d) and (f) to third parties if needed for the communication and publicising activities 
of [the Agency or]  the Commission.  
If the right of use is subject to rights of a third  party (including personnel of the beneficiary), the 
beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under this Agreement (in particular, by 
obtaining the necessary approval from the third parties concerned).  
Where applicable (and if provided  by the beneficiaries), the [Agency and the]  Commission will insert the 
following information:  
"© — [year] — [name of the copyright owner]. All rights reserved. Licensed to the [[name of the

1. Communicatio n activities (EU) 
The Commission/Agency may use (free of charge) any (non-confidential and non -classified) 
information, documents and materials received from the beneficiaries, for its own communication 
and publicising activities.  
Examples (material ): summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public deliverables 
and any other material, such as pictures or audio -visual material, provided by beneficiaries  
Examples ( communication activities) : using a picture or the publishable summary included in the final 
report submitted by the action to write a story about a particularly successful action for a Commission 
publication (e.g. Horizon - The EU Research & Innovation Magazine), or for speeches, e tc.  
Examples ( publicising activities):  providing on an  Commission/Agency website general information 
about the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.  
If the use would risk compromising legitimate inte rests, the beneficiary may request that the 
material is not used. This request must explain why and include the information, documents 
or material concerned.  
If the Commission/Agency needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort 
any content.  
Beneficiaries may ask the Commission/Agency to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including 
such a notice in the material) . 
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency can use the documents or materials 
by making arrangements  with any third parties  that could claim rights to the m.  
 
 38.3 Consequences  of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see  Article 43 ). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 6.

ARTICLE 39 — PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Processing of personal data (EU) 
The Commission/Agency will process personal data in compliance with Regulation  2018/1725   and 
as set out in its Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statements . 
Personal data will be processed only for the purpose of implementing, managing and 
monitoring the GA or protecting EU/Euratom  financial interests (including controls on eligib ility 
of costs, proper implementation of the action and compliance with other obligations).  
The level of detail of the data requested will be determined case -by-case and will be 
limited to what is necessary (for implementing, m anaging, monitoring and controlling the 
GA or protecting the EU financial interests ). 
 
 
 
 
 
The processing of personal data under the GA (manual or electronic) will be first notified  (by 
the data controller) to the Commission/Agency Data Protection Officer (DPO).  ARTICLE 39 — PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA  
39.1 Processing of  personal data  by the [Agency and the] Commission  
Any personal data  under the Agreement will be processed by the [Agency or the] Commission  under 
Regulation No 45/200153 and according to the ‘ notifications of the  processing operations ’ to the Data 
Protection Officer (DPO)  of the [Agency or the]  Commission  (publicly accessible in the DPO register ). 
Such data will be processed by the ‘data controller’  of the [Agency or the]  Commission for the purposes 
of implementing, managing and monitoring the Agreement or protecting the financial interests of t he EU or 
Euratom (including checks, reviews, audits and investigations; see  Article 22 ). 
The persons whose personal data are processed  have the right to access and correct their own personal data. 
For this purpose, they must send any queries about the processing of their personal data to the data 
controller, via the contact point indicated in the privacy statement(s) that are published o n the [Agency and] 
Commission websites.  
They also have the right to have recourse  at any time to the European Data Protection Supervisor 
(EDPS) . 
 
53 Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 
12.01.2001, p. 1).  
 
 When the Commission/Agency collects and processes personal data under the GA, n ational data 
protection law is NOT applicable and will NOT be accepted as a pretext for not complying with 
obligations under the GA.  
Disclosure of staff data under the GA (e.g. data requested by the Commission/Agency project 
officer or auditors)  is automatically justified under Article 5(c) of Regulation  45/2001 .

H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 39.1  286 The notifications are available via the  Register of the DPO59 (and describe the processing 
operations, legal basis, security safeguards,  retention p eriod, possible data transfer, etc.). 
In addition, for processing that implies  specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data 
subjects ( e.g. processing of data relating to health ), the European Data Protection Supervisor 
(EDPS) will be consulted.  
 
2. Right to access and correct personal data  
Persons whose data is being processed ( data subjects) can contact the data controller or the  DPO 
(via the contact information in the  privacy statement ), to: 
 correct  errors in the data, block access or delete the ir data 
 complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation fo r any damage.  
 
3. Complaints to the EDPS  
Persons whose data is being processed by the Commission/Agency can lodge a complaint with the  
European Data Protection Supervisor  (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority  for data 
processing by EU institutions ). 
Best practice:  The beneficiaries should  first contact the data controller (via the contact information  
in the  privacy statement ), since s/he might be ab le to solve the  problem quickly.

1. Processing of personal data (consortium ) 
The be neficiaries must process persona l data under the GA in accordance with EU and national law 
on data protection (in particular, Directive 95/46/EC60 and the corresponding national law).  
 
 
 
‘Personal data ’ means any  information, private or professional, which relates to an identified 
or identifiable natural person  (for the full definition, see Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46/EC) .  
Examples (personal data):  name, address, identification number, e -mail, CV, bank account number, 
phone number, medical records . 
There are various potential identifiers, including full name, pseudonyms, occupation, 
address or any combination of these.  Individuals are considered NOT ‘identifiable’, if 
identifying them requires excessive effort.   
Certain  categories of data are more ‘sensitive’ than others, and these may only be 
processed according to specific rules. 61 
Examples (sensitive data): racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, 
trade -union mem bership, health, sexual orientation , etc. 
‘Processing  of personal data’  means any operation (or set of operations) which is 
performed on personal data, either manually or by automatic means. This includes:  
 collection  
 recording  
 organisation and storage

61  See Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC . 39.2 Processing of personal data by the beneficiaries  
The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with applicable EU and 
national law on data protection  (including authorisations or notification requirements).  
The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access only to data that is strictly necessary for implementing, 
managing and monitoring the Agreement.  
The beneficiaries must inform the personnel whose personal data are collected and processed by  the [Agency 
or the] Commission] . For this purpose, they must provide them with the privacy statement(s) (see above) , 
before transmitting their data to the [Agency or the] Commission . 
39.3 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 39.2, the [Commission] [Agency]  may apply 
any of the measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
 The Directive is currently under revision. The new General Data Protection Regulation No 2016/679 
will apply from 25 May 2018.

Examples  (processing of personal data) : creating a mailing list  or a list of participants; managing a 
database; accounting records on personnel costs; time -sheets; project planning with names .  
Under these laws , personal data must be processed according to certain principles and 
conditions that aim to ensure data qual ity and confidentiality .62 
The b eneficiaries must give their staff access to the personal data ONLY  on a need to know  
basis, for carrying out their functions under  the GA.  This means that the beneficiaries must put 
in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various categories of data they 
hold. 
The b eneficiaries must inform their staff (whose personal data are collected and processed 
by the Commission /Agency) about the disclosure  of their data to the Commission/Agency  (by 
providing them with the  relevant Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statements ). 
Examples:  
1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register  or into a proposal, the beneficiary must provide the 
staff concerned with the  privacy statement . 
2. If in an ex-post audit, the Commissio n requests the names, CVs, time -sheets and salaries of the 
beneficiary’s staff (to check the eligibility of personnel costs),  the beneficiary must inform the staff 
concerned and provide them with the privacy statement . 
Processing of personal data is also part of the ethics obligations (see Article 34 ). Both 
provisions must be complied with .

1. Assignment of claims for payment  
What ? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) c laims for payment (for work 
carried out under the action ) to a third party , if the Commission /Agency  has explicitly agreed in 
writing.  
 
 
 
 
 
Only actual  (i.e. existing) claims for payment may be assigned  (including pre -financing) . 
Assignment is NOT possible for future claims.  
How?  Assignment of payment claims must be requested . 
The request for approval must come from the coordinator, on behalf of the beneficiary 
concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the  assignment.  
The Commission/Agency will assess the reasons given and approve or reject the request in 
writing.  
Examples (reasonable requests for assignment):  
1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the end of the 
action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity .  
2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure .  
If the assignment is linked  to bankruptcy , the approval will be  subject to compliance with national 
law. 
 
 Assignment s of rights under this Article are limited to claims for  payment  under  Article 21 . Transfers 
of other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it)  are governed by 
other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 55 ). 
 Assignment has NO effect on the  beneficiary ’s obligations  under the GA; it remains fully bound  by 
them. 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 40 — ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS FOR PAYMENT AGAINST THE [COMMISSION] 
[AGENCY]  
The beneficiaries may not assign any of their claims for payment against the [Commission] [Agency]  to any 
third party, except if approved by the [Commission] [Agency]  on the basis of a reasoned, written request by 
the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned).  
If the [Commission] [Agency]  has not accepted the assignment or the terms of it are not observed, the 
assignment will have no effec t on it.  
In no circumstances will an assignment release the beneficiaries from their obligations towards the 
[Commission] [Agency] .

41.1 Role and responsibility towards the [Commission] [Agency]     
The beneficiary has full responsibility for implementing the action and complying with the Agreement.  
The beneficia ry is itself responsible for:  
(a) monitoring that the action is implemented properly (see  Article 7 ); 
(b) informing the [Commission][Agency]  immediately of any events or circumstances likely to affect 
significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see Article 17 ); 
(c) submitting the deliverables and reports to the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Articles 19  and 20);  
(d)  submitting to the [Commission][Agency]  in good time any documents or information required by it  
and may not delegate or subcontract these tasks to any third party (including linked third parties).

H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.1  291 
 
1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the 
Commission/Agency  
The b eneficiaries have full responsibility for implementing the action  (see Article 7 ) and for 
complying with the GA . 
This means that: 
 each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the GA  
 each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that 
there are no delays which can be attributed to it)  
 each beneficiary is responsible ( towards  the Commission/Agency) for the tasks 
performed by its subcontractors and linked third parties  
 the Commission/Agency is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and 
has NO responsibility  for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse 
consequences).  
The b eneficiaries are jointly and severally liable for the technical implementation  of the 
action.   
This means that the beneficiaries — including any new beneficiary introduced t hrough an 
amendment — accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole 
action — even if one of them withdraws.  
If one of them withdraws , the remaining members of the consortium must carry out the 
action as set out in the GA — including the part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed 
to carry out — unless the Commission/Agency expressly agrees  otherwise (exceptional; only 
for specific reasons) . They will have to do this without any additional funding  (although  — in 
case of beneficiary termination  — the Guarantee Fund may intervene  for the defaulting 
beneficiary; see Article 50 ).  
Example:  Legal entities A, B and C are members of a consortium that signed a GA with the 
Commission in order to carry out a research action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt. 
Beneficiaries A and B (or even only A or B) must carry out the entire action as described in Annex 1.  
The remaining beneficiaries may later take legal action against the defaulting benefic iary, 
in order to obtain compensation.   
Moreover, the GA will have to be amended , in order to redistribute the tasks, terminate 
the beneficiary’s participatio n, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 50 ). 
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility  is in principle limited to its own 
debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by its linked third parties . It is only for the 5% 
contribution  to the Guarantee Fund  that financial responsi bility is shared ; see Article 21.4 ).

under the Agreemen t and the complementary grant agreement(s) (see Article 2 ), covering for instance:  
- efficient decision making processes and  
- settlement of disputes.  
The collaboration agreement must not contain any provision contrary to the Agree ment.  
The beneficiaries and complementary beneficiaries must create and participate in common boards and 
advisory structures to decide on collaboration and synchronisation of activities, including on management 
of outcomes, common approaches towards standardisation, SME involvement, links with regulatory and 
policy activities, and commonly shared dissemination and awareness raising activities.  
The beneficiaries must give access to their results to the complementary beneficiaries , for the purposes of 
the complementary grant agreement(s) (see Article 31.6 ). 
The beneficiaries must share the technical reports (see  Article 20.3  and 20.4). The confidentiality 
obligations in Article 36 apply. ]

H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.2  296 The beneficiaries must send all documents/information via the coordinator  — unless , for specific 
cases, the Commission/Agency requests them to provide such information directly (see Article 
22). 
Example:   
In case of an audit, the beneficiaries must submit the documents requested directly to the auditors, if 
requested so . 
 
2. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities  
The coordinator is the central contact point  for the Commission/Agency and represents the 
consortium ( towards  the Commission/Agency).  
For this purpose, the GA imposes a number of specific coordination tasks.  
Main  coordination tasks:  
 Monitor that the action is implemented properly  
 Act as the inte rmediary for all communications — unless the Agreement specifies otherwise  
 Request and review any documents or information required and verify their completeness 
and correctness  
The coordinator must check the quality of the documents submitted by the beneficiaries , 
including : 
 reviewing the individual financial statements from each beneficiary to verify 
consistency with the action tasks, as well as their completeness and correctness 
(e.g. that the addition of the different costs declared by the benefici ary corresponds 
to the total amount declared, or that the 25% flat -rate for indirect costs is correctly 
calculated)  
The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility  of these costs (under 
Article 6 ) or to reque st justifications. Each beneficiary remains responsible for the 
cost it declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and 
supporting documents to substantiate them).  
 verifying that all the requested documents are submitted by the beneficiary (e.g. 
the summary, the questionnaire etc .)  
 verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents in the requested format  
 verify ing that the technical information submitted by a beneficiary concerns its 
action tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action) . 
 Submit the deliverables and reports  
 Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay  
 Inform the Commission/A gency  of the amounts paid to each benef iciary, if requested to do 
so (see Article 44.1.2 ) 
The c oordination tasks listed in Article 41 .2 can normally NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to a 
third party  (including linked third parties) . They can  NOT be carried out by other beneficiaries.  (By 
contrast , the coordinator  remains free  — like any other beneficiary — to subcontract or use linked 
third parties  for other  tasks; see Article s 13, 14).  
 
Specific cases  (coordinator ’s responsibilities ): 
Authorisation to administer  — Coordinators that are s econdary or higher education establishments 
and coordinators that are  public bodies may exceptionally delegate the administration of the payments  
to another legal entity (third party ), in most cases a foundation .  
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.3  297 The third p arty must fulfil the following conditions:  
 they must have been granted the ‘authorisation to administer’  
AND 
 it must be affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
affairs (and those must includ e receiving and administering EU funds ). 
 
 
 
 
 
In this case, t he option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisation s to administer must be added to the grant 
agreement.  The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8  must be that of the entity with 
the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
therefore be registered in the Participant Register  and valid ated by the Commission/Agency. It will get 
its own PIC — although it is not a beneficiary.  
The costs of the entity may be declared by the coordinator as in -kind contributions (free of charge or 
against payment; see Articles 6 , 11 and 12).  
ERICs (E uropean Research Infrastructure Consorti a)64 — Beneficiaries that are ERIC s and do not 
have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the following coordination tasks to one  of its 
members:  
 monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7 ); 
 act as intermediary for communications (see Article 17 ); 
 request and review documents or information required and verify completeness and 
correctness;  
 submit deliverables and reports (see Articles 19  and 20); 
 
 
 
Scientific coordinator — Non-administrative coordination t asks (i.e. tasks not listed in this Article , 
e.g. scientific coordination of the action ) can be carried out by an y beneficiary . 
Such a beneficiary may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called ‘scientific coordinator’. In the 
relationship with the Commission/Agency, it will however NOT be considered the action’s coordinator  
(but one of the other beneficiaries) . 
Costs for sc ientific coordination can be eligible, if they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in 
Article 6 . 
 
H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.3  
3. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement  
The beneficiaries must c onclude a consortium agreement to ensure a smooth and successful 
project implementation  — unless exceptionally provided  otherwise in the  work p rogramme /call.  
Best practice:  In view of their importance for avoiding disputes and ensuring  a smooth 
implementation of the grant , the Commission/Agencies strongly recommend that every 
consortium sets up a consortium agreement, even if not mandatory.  
The ‘consortium agreement ’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out their 
internal arrangements for implementing the grant.  It is purely internal; the EU/Euratom is not 
party and has NO responsibility for it (nor for any adverse consequences).

 Project management  — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer  remain fully responsible  for it under 
the GA.  
 
 
 ERICs using one of their members remain fully responsible  for it under the GA.  
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.4  298 The consortium ag reement should complement  the GA and must NOT contain any provision 
contrary to it  (or to the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013  or the Finan cial 
Regulation No 966/2012 ). 
The consortium agreement should in principle be negotiated and concluded before the signature 
of the GA (i.e. each beneficiary should sign the  consortium agreement before acceding to the 
GA). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged disagreement jeopardises the action. 
Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to remain the same during the lifetime of the 
action, it can be modified by the consortium at any moment.  
The consortium agreement  must be in writing . It may be a simple written agreement or take 
some  other form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such  as a 
European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).   
Best practice:  The beneficiaries should  carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of the 
different legal forms, and choose the one that best fits the consortium’s specific needs.  
 
 
 
 
H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.4  
4. Relationship with complementary beneficiaries — Collaboration agreement  
If the GA provides for this option, the beneficiaries must conclude a collaboration agreement  to 
ensure a smooth and successful project implement ation.  
The option will be inserted ONLY for complementary actions (see Article 2 ). 
A ‘collaboration agreement ’ is an agreement between the consortium  and the beneficiaries of 
another complementary H2020 grant, to coordinate their work under the different GAs.  It is purely 
internal;  the EU/Euratom is not party and has NO responsibility for them (nor for any adverse 
consequences).  
The beneficiaries of co mplementary grants must — through the collaboration agreement — create 
and participate in common boards and advisory structures , to decide on collaboration and 
synchronisation of the activities.  These boards and advisory structures complement the 
governance of the project ; they do not replace the consortium and other project governance 
mechanisms (if any) .   
 
5. Relationship with participants  of a joint action — Coordination agreement  
If the GA provides for this option, the beneficiaries  must conclude a coordination agreement , to 
ensure a smooth and successful project implementation .  
The option will be inserted ONLY for jointly funded actions (see Article 2 ). 
A ‘coordination agreement ’ is an agreement  between the consortium  and the participants of the 
third country /international organisation (I O) action (see Article 2 ). It is purely internal; t he 
EU/Euratom is not party  and has NO responsibility for it (or for any adverse consequences).  
The coordination agreement should complement  the GA and must NOT contain any provision 
contrary to them  (or to the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013  or the Financial 
Regulation No 966/2012 ).  
Moreover, it must be in line with the consortium agreement.  It can NOT replace the consortium 
agreement  (and vice versa ).The coordination agreement should in principle be negotiated and 
concluded before any work is begun . The work programme/call may require that proposals 
include a draft coordination agreement.

SANCTIONS  
ARTICLE 42 — REJECTION OF INELIGIBLE COSTS   
42.1 Conditions  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will — after termination of the participation of a beneficiary  at the time of 
an interim payment, at the payment of the balance or afterwards  — reject any costs which are ineligible 
(see Article 6 ), in particular following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 22 ). 
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 
22.5.2).  
42.2 Ineligible costs to be rejected — Calculation  — Procedure  
Ineligible costs will be rejected in full [OPTION  if lump sum foreseen in Article 5.2: , except for lump sum 
costs, which  will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented ]. 
If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery  (see Article 44 ), the [Commission][Agency]  will 
formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the 
reasons why (if applicable, together with the notification of amounts due; see  Article 21.5 ). The coordinator 
or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — formally notify the 
[Commission][Agency]  of its disagreement and the reasons why.  
If the rejection of costs leads to a recovery, the [Commission][Agen cy] will follow the contradictory 
procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 44.  
42.3 Effects  
If the [Commission][Agency]  rejects costs at the time of an interim payment or the payment of the 
balance , it will deduct them from the total eligib le costs declared, for the action, in the periodic or final 
summary financial statement (see  Articles 20.3  and 20.4). It will then calculate the interim payment or 
payment of the balance as set ou t in Articles 21.3 or 21.4.  
If the [Commission][Agency]  rejects costs  after  termination of the participation of a beneficiary , it will 
deduct them from the costs declared by the beneficiary in the termination report and include the rejection in 
the calculation after termination (see Article 50.2  and 50.3). 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 42  301  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Cost rejection  
If the Commission/Agency finds ineligible costs  (in particular, following a check, audit, extension 
of audit findings, review or OLAF investigation) , it will reject these costs (— in full, i.e. for the 
amount that is ineligible).  
 
 
 
Grounds for cost rejection ( EU): 
 Costs do not comply with  the GA eligibility rules (in this grant)  
The Commission/Agency will reject costs, if they do not comply with the eligibility rules set 
out in Articles 6  and 8-16. 
 Costs do not comply with  the GA eligibility rules (in other grants)  
The Commission/Agency may also reject costs, if such ineligibility was found in other 
grants, if :  
 the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and  
 the ineligibility is :  
 systemic or recurrent and  
 has a materi al impact on this grant.  
Rejection of costs can take place at any moment — at the time of beneficiary termination, interim 
payment, payment of the balance or afterwards.  
 
2. Procedure  
The procedure differs according to the situation:  
 if cost rejection leads to  a recovery: there will be an ex ante  contradictory procedure   
 if cost rejection does NOT lead to a recovery : there will be  NO ex ante  contradictory 
procedure, but the possibility to object ex post  to the rejection (payment  review 
procedure ). 
In both cases, the Commission/Agency will explain which costs were rejected and why they 
were rejected. In both cases, beneficiaries can object and bring forward their arguments for 
disagreeing. The switch to the ex post payment review  procedure allows the  
  Cost r ejection s will be made for violations of cost eligibility rules  (see Articles 6 , 8-16) and will 
correspond to the amount that is ineligible . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 If the [Commission][Agency]  — after an interim payment but before the payment of the balance  — 
rejects costs declared in a periodic summary financial statement, it will deduct them from the total eligible 
costs declared, for the action, in the next periodic summary financial statement or in the final summary 
financial statement. It will then calcula te the interim payment or payment of the balance as set out in 
Articles 21.3 or 21.4.    
If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs  after the payment of the balance , it will deduct the amount 
rejected from the total eligible costs declared, by the beneficia ry, in the final summary financial statement. 
It will then calculate the revised final grant amount as set out in Article 5.4.

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 42  302 Commission/Agency however to pay quickly  without having to suspend the payment deadline 
(by postponing the discussion on the disputed costs).  
Contradictory procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its int ention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
Step 2 —  The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
confirms  it (notification of amounts due ; see Article 21.5 ). 
Payment r eview procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator abo ut the rejection of costs and 
notifies the amounts that will be paid out ( notification of amounts due ; see Article 
21.5). 
Step 2 —  If the beneficiaries disagree, the coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to 
inform the Commission/Agency of its objections.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the request for review and informs  the coordinator of 
its outcome . 
Depending on the moment when costs are rejected, this procedure will be directed either at the 
coordinator  or the beneficiary concerned : 
 for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the payment of the balance: normally 
the coordinator  
 for rejections after beneficiary termination and after payment of the balance: normally the 
beneficiary concerned.  
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiar ies 
concerned offline, via its usual communication channels (e.g. e -mail, registered letters with 
proof of delivery, etc.)  and ask for its comments. It m ust also inform the other beneficiaries.  
If it is directed at the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator in later 
on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).  
 
 
 
 
3. Effects  
If the Commission/Agency rejects costs at  beneficiary termination , it will deduct the rejected 
amount from the costs the beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount 
due to the beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre -financing and interim) payments 
received by the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will recover the difference  (see Articles 44  
and 50).  
Recovery at beneficiary termination during an ongoing action mean s that the beneficiary 
should pay back the amount to the consortium . If it doesn’t, the Guarantee Fund will intervene 
and the Commission/Agency will then recover the amount for the Guarantee Fund.  
If the Commission/Agency rejects costs at the moment of  an interim payment or the payment 
of the balance , it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Articles 
5.3 and 21). 
 Information obligation — Beneficiaries do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them 
to submit comments. However, they should inform them if there is the risk of a significant impact 
on the action (see Article 17.2 ).

 ARTICLE 43 — REDUCTION OF THE GRANT  
43.1 Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency]  may — after termination of the participation of a beneficiary, at the 
payment of the balance  or afterwards  — reduce the grant amount (see Article 5.1), if:  
(a)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure 
(including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
to provide required information, breach of ethical principles) or  
(b) a benef iciary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) has 
committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of oblig ations that have a material impact on 
this grant ( extension of findings from other grants  to this grant ; see Article 22.5.2).  
43.2 Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure  
The amount of the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
breach of obligations.  
Before reduction of the grant, the [Commission] [Agency]  will formally notify a ‘ pre-information letter ’ to 
the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
- informing it of its intention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons why 
and 
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the [Commission] [Agency]  does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the 
observation s it has received , it will formally notify  confirmation  of the reduction (if applicable, together 
with the notification of amounts due; see  Article 21 ). 
43.3 Effects  
If the [Commission][Agency]  reduces the grant after termination of the participation of a beneficiary , it 
will calculate the reduced grant amount for that beneficiary and then determine the amount due to that 
beneficiary (see Article 50.2 and 50.3).  
If the [Commission] [Agency]  reduces the grant  at the time of the payment of the balance , it will calculate 
the reduced grant amount for the action and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see  
Articles 5.3.4  and 21.4). 
If the [Commission] [Agency]  redu ces the grant after the payment of the balance , it will calculate the 
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned (see Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount 
for the beneficiary concerned is lower than its sha re of the final grant amount, the [Commission] [Agency]  
will recover the difference (see Article 44 ).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 43  305 
 
1. Grant reduction  
If the Commission/Agency finds (in particular following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, 
review or OLAF investigation)  substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or breach of  
obligations  under the GA or during the award procedure  (e.g. the action has not been properly 
implemented) , it may reduce the grant  in propo rtion to the seriousness of the  errors, irregularities 
or fraud or  breach  of obligations . 
 
 
 
 
 
Grounds for grant reduction ( EU): 
 Substantial errors, irregularities or  fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
grant)  
The Commission/Agency may make a grant reduction if a beneficiary has committed 
substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either during the 
award procedure or under the GA.  
Serious breach of obligations covers all kinds of non -compliance with GA obligations 
(including obligations during the award procedure).  
Example:  false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain  EU funding  
In practice, the most frequent breach is improper implementation of the action /non-
compliance with Annex 1 GA (i.e. if the work performed does not correspond  to the 
activities described in Annex  1). This will normally be examined on the basis o f the periodic 
and final technical reports  and, if needed, a project review.  
 Substantial errors, irregularities or  fraud  OR serious breach of obligations (in 
other grants)  
The Commission/Agency may also make a grant reduction , if such substantial errors, 
irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  were found in other  grants, if :  
 the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and  
 the substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud or serious breach of obligations  are:  
 systemic or recurrent and  
 have a material impact on this grant.  
Reduction for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud was introduced as explicit contractual 
ground with GA version 3.0. For older grant agreements, grant reduction on these grounds was 
however also possible directly on the basis of Article 135(4) and (5) of the Financial Regulation 
No 966/2012  (and i n very exceptional cases involving fra ud schemes also on the basis of Article 
1116 of the Belgian Code Civil — as annulation ab initio  pour dol65). 
Grant r eduction can take place : 
 at beneficiary termination  
 at the payment of the balance  or 
                                            
65  See judgment of 12 July 2016, Commission/Thales, T -326/1 3, points 119 -128. 
  Grant  reductions will be made ( at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action  or after the 
payment of the balance) for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, in 
proportion to  the seriousness of the error, irregularity, fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud  the reduction 
may be up to a 100%) . 
 If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all possible corrective 
steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the GA.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 43  306  after the payment of the balance.  
Reduction at beneficiary termination  was introduced explicitly with GA version 3.0. For older grant 
agreements, there is NO grant reduction at beneficiary termination for serious breach of contract 
(since explicitly NOT foreseen). By contrast, grant reduction at benefi ciary termination is possible 
for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud — directly on the basis of Article 135(4) and (5) of the 
Financial Regulation No 966/2012  (see above) . 
 
 
 
2. Procedure  
The Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure . 
Contradictory procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
Step 2 —  The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and e ither stops the procedure or 
confirms  it (notification of amounts due ; see Article 21.5 ). 
Depending on the moment the reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either at the 
coordinator  or the beneficiary concerned : 
 for reductions at beneficiary termination: normally with the beneficiary concerned  
 for reductions at payment of the balance: normally the coordinator  
 for reductions after payment of the balance : normally  the beneficiary concerned.  
If it is direc ted at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries 
concerned offline, via its usual communication channels (e.g. e -mail, registered letters with proof 
of delivery, etc.)  and ask for their comments. It must also inform the oth er beneficiaries.  
If it is directed at the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator in copy (in a 
way that preserves confidentiality).   
 
 
 
 
3. Effects  
If the Commission/Agency reduces the grant at beneficiary termination , it will calculate the 
reduction at beneficiary -level and calculate the amount due  to the beneficiary.  If the amount is 
lower than the (pre -financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the beneficiary 
will have to pay back  the difference  (see Articles 44  and 50). 
Recovery at beneficiary termination during an ongoing action means that the beneficiary should 
pay back the amount to the consortium . If it doesn’t, the Guarantee Fund will intervene and the 
Commission/Agency will then recover the amount for the Guarantee Fund.  
If the Commission/Agency reduces the grant at the payment of the balance , it will calculate the 
reductions for each beneficiary and for the action (if any) and calculate the balance to be paid to 
the consortium (i.e. final grant amount) accordingly  (see Articles 5.3  and 21).  
 Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them to 
submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action 
(see Article 1 7.2).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 43  307 If the Commission/Agency reduces the grant after the payment of the balance , it will calculate 
the reduction for the  beneficiary and compare the re vised grant amount with its share of the  final 
grant amount . If the revised grant amount is lower , the Commission/Agency will  recover the 
difference  (see Article s 5.4 and 44).  
The detailed calculation s for all cases are described in Article 21 .

 ARTICLE 44 — RECOVERY OF UNDUE AMOUNTS  
44.1 Amount to be recovered — Calculation  — Procedure  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will — after termination of the participation of a beneficiary , at the 
payment of the balance  or afterwards  — claim back any amount that was paid but is not due under the 
Agreement.  
Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt  [OPTION if Article 
14 applies: (including undue amounts paid by the [Commission] [Agency]  for costs declared by its linked 
third parties) ], except for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see  Article 21.4 ). 
MULTI -BENEFICIARY: 44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation  
If recovery takes place after termination of a beneficiary’s participation (including the coordinator), the 
[Commission] [Agency]  will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned by formally 
notifying it  a debit note (see  Article 50.2  and 50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
terms and th e date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Agency or the]  Commission will recover  
the amount:  
(a) by ‘offsetting ’ it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the beneficiary 
concerned by the [Agency, the]  Commission or an [other]  executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the [Agency or the] Commission  
may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) [OPTION  1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
[Commission][Agency] : if a linked third party has accepted joint and several liability (see Article 14 ), 
by holding the third party liable  up to the maximum EU contribution indicated, for the linked third 
party, in the estimated budget (see Annex 2) and/or ][OPTION 2:  not applicable; ] 
(c) by taking legal action (see Article 57 ) or by adopting an enforceable decision  under Article 299 of 
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty]  and Article 
79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
be increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the 
payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the [Agency or the]  Commission receives full 
payment of the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late -payment interest and the n against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC55 applies.  
44.1.2  Recovery at payment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see  Article 21.4 ), the [Commission] [Agency]  
will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter ’ to the coordinator:  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
 
55 Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market 
amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC (OJ L 319, 05.12.2007, p. 1).

 - specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund;  
- requesting the coordinator to submit a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries 
within 30 days of receiving notification, and  
- inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the [Commission] [Agency]  decides to pursue recovery despite the 
observations it has received , it will confirm re covery  (together with the notification of amounts due; see  
Article 21.5 ) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund,  if the difference is positive  or 
- formally not ify to the coordinator a debit note  for the difference between the amount to be 
recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative . This note 
will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission] [Agency]  by the date in the debit note  and has not 
submitted the report on the distribution of payments: the [Agency or the]  Commission  will recover the 
amount set out in the debit note from the coordinator (s ee below).    
If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission] [Agency]  by the date in the debit note, but has submitted 
the report on the distribution of payments:  the [Commission] [Agency]  will: 
(a) identify the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:  
{{{{beneficiary’s costs declared in the final summary financial statement and approved by the 
[Commission] [Agency]  multiplied by the reimbursement rate set out in Article 5.2 for the beneficiary concerned  
[plus  
its linked third parties’ costs declared in the final summary financial statement and approved by the 
[Commission] [Agency]  multiplied by the reimbursement rate set out in Article 5.2 for each linked third party 
concerned] } 
divided by  
the EU contribution for the action calc ulated according to Article 5.3.1 } 
multiplied by  
the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) }, 
minus  
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary} }. 
(b) formally notify to each beneficiary identified according to point (a) a debit note  specifying the terms 
and date for payment. The amount of the debit note is calculated as follows:  
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned  
divided by  
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)}  
multiplied by  
the amount set out in the debit note formally notified to the coordinator }.

 If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Commission] [Agency]  will recover  the 
amount:  
(a) by offsetting it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the 
beneficiary concerned by the [Agency, the]  Commission or an [other]  executive agency (from the 
EU or Euratom budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the [Agency or the]  
Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) by drawing on  the Guarantee Fund. The [Agency or the]  Commission  will formally notify the 
beneficiary concerned the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:  
(i) [OPTION  1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
[Commission][Agency] : if a linked third party has accepted joint and several liability (see  
Article 14 ), by  holding the third party liable  up to the maximum EU contribution 
indicated, for the linked third party, in the estimated budget (see Annex 2) 
and/or ][OPTION 2:  not applicable ]; 
(ii) by taking l egal action (see Article 57 ) or by adopting an enforceable decision  under 
Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the 
Euratom Treaty] and Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the payment 
date in the debit note, up to and inc luding the date the [Agency or the]  Commission receives full payment of 
the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late -payment interest and then against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC applies.  
MULTI -BENEFICIARY: 44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If, for a beneficiary, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than its share of the final grant 
amount, it must repay the difference to the [Commission] [Agency].  
The beneficiary’s share of the final grant amount is calculated as follows:  
{{{beneficiary’s costs declared in the final summary financial statement and approved by the [Commission] [Agency]  
multiplied by the reimbursement rate set out in Article 5.2 for the beneficiary concerned  
[plus  
its linked third parties’ costs declared in the final summary financial statement and approved by the 
[Commission] [Agency]  multiplied by the reimbursement rate set out in Article 5.2 for each linked third party 
concerned] } 
divided by  
the EU contribution for the action calculated according to Article  5.3.1} 
multiplied by  
the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) }. 
If the coordinator has not distributed amounts received (see  Article 21.7 ), the [Commission][Agency ] will 
also recover these amounts.

1. Recovery of undue amounts  
If it turns out that — due to early termination, cost rejection or grant  reduction (in particular, 
following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, review or OLAF investigation)  — the 
Commission/Agency has paid too much , it will recover the amount  that is undue .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grounds for recovery ( EU): 
 Commission/Agency  paid too much  
The Commission/Agency will make a recovery, if the amounts paid out exceed the amounts 
that are due for the grant.  
Recovery normally take s place only at payment of the balance  or afterwards . Exceptionally , it 
can take place before , if a beneficiary’s participation  is terminated . 
The Commission/Agency will recover after beneficiary termination if the beneficiary did not pay 
back to the coordinator the amounts it received in excess and — following this — the 
Guarantee Fund had to intervene (see Article 50 ).  
The Commission/Agency will recover at the payment of the balance if the sum of the pre -
financing and the interim payments exceeds the final grant amount (see Articles 5.3  and 21). 
The Commission/Agency will recover after payment of the balance if — due to cost rejection or 
grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit findings or OLAF 
investigation)  — it finds out that it has paid in excess  (or that the coordinator did not 
distribute the payments received ; see Article 5.4 ). 
The detailed calculations  for all cases  are described in Article 21 . 
 
2. Procedure  
The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory procedure , 
the Commission/Agency claims repayment of the amounts and then enforces recovery.  
Contradictory  procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/ beneficiary concerned of its intention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
Step 2 —  The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 da ys. 
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
confirms  it (notification of amounts due ; see Article 21.5 ) and issues a debit note . 
  The Commission/Agency will recover  the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the  money 
(i.e. with a debt towards the Commission/Agency).  
In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial res ponsibility is normally limited to its own debt  
(including undue amounts paid for costs declared by its linked third parties , if any). Only the 
responsibility for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (i.e. the 5% withheld from the pre -
financing; see Article 21.4 ) is shared.  
If the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party  (see 
Article 14 ), it may recover also from the linked third party. The linked th ird party’s financial 
responsibility (for the debt of the beneficiary) is limited to its maximum grant amount  in Annex 2 .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 44  313 Enforced recovery : 
If the coordinator/ beneficiary concerned does not pay by th e date set out in the debit note , the 
Commission  or the Agency will recover  the amount (with interest at the rate set out in  Article 
21.11 ), in one of the following ways:  
 by offsetting  it66 
‘Offsetting ’ means to deduct  the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency from 
another amount that the Commission/Agency owes to debtor . With the offsetti ng both 
amounts are considered paid. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Normally , offsetting is carried out after the payment deadline has expired. However, in 
exceptional circumstances, the Commission  or the Agency may offset before this date, in 
order to safeguard the EU financial interests.67  
If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must 
also be offset . The interest  is normally offset first, before the principal amount .  
 by drawing on the Guarantee Fund and then follow it with the debit note  on behalf of  the 
Guarantee Fund  (to continue the recovery procedure):  
 if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked third 
party: by holding the linked third party liable  
or 
 by either:  
 taking legal action  in a national court or the European Court of Justice  (see Article 
57.2) or 
 adopting a decision  that is enforceable  within the meaning of Article 299 
TFEU68.69  
The decision describes the claim and its grounds, notes that the debtor has not paid

pecuniary obligation on persons other than States, shall be enforceab le. Enforcement shall be governed by the 
rules of civil procedure in force in the State in the territory of which it is carried out. The order for its 
enforcement shall be appended to the decision, without other formality than verification of the authentic ity of 
the decision, by the national authority which the government of each Member State shall designate for this 
purpose and shall make known to the Commission and to the Court of Justice of the European Union. When 
these formalities have been completed o n application by the party concerned, the latter may proceed to 
enforcement in accordance with the national law, by bringing the matter directly before the competent authority. 
Enforcement may be suspended only by a decision of the Court. However, the cour ts of the country concerned 
shall have jurisdiction over complaints that enforcement is being carried out in an irregular manner.  
69  See Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation  No 966/2012 . 
  Offsetting  is normally implemented as a public law measure  (i.e. directly on the 
basis of Article 80(1) of the the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 ). Therefore, the 
dispute settlemen t normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU  
action; see Article 57.2 ).  
For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will — exceptionally — 
be implemented as a purely contractual measure  (e.g. offsetting with Commission 
and Agency claims, offsetting against international organisations) . In this case, the 
normal contractual means for dispute settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU  action, 
arbitration, etc. ; see Article 57.2 ).

  Enforceable decisions are public law measures  (i.e. taken directly on the basis of 
Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/201 2). Therefore, the dispute settlement

decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations, where this would be contrary to the 
privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents or international law (see Article 
53.2).  
Offsetting is — by contrast  — a measure that may be taken in relation to  international organisations, 
however NOT as public law measure (i.e. not on the basis of Article 80(1) of the Financial Regulation No 
966/2012 ), but as a purely contractual measure (i.e. on the basis of Article 44 of the GA). Offsetting for 
international organisations will therefore be subject to  the contractual means for dispute settlement 
(i.e. arb itration; see Article 57.2 ).

ARTICLE 45 — ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL PENALTIES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Administrative sanctions  
If the Commission/Agency finds (in particular, following a check, audit, review or OLAF 
investigation)  that a beneficiary is in an exclusion situation under Article 106(1) of the Financial 
Regulation No 966/2012 , it may impose administrative sanctions  (— in proportion to the 
seriousness of the misconduct) . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The maximum  sanctions are as follows:  
 for exclusion : up to  5 years from the date on which the Commission/Agency establishes 
the infringement, i.e.  confirms the sanction and formally notifies this to the beneficiary.  
If, in that time, the beneficiary commits the same infringement again, the exclusion period 
may be extended to 10 years . 
 for financial penalties: between 2% and 10%  of the maximum EU contribution to the 
beneficiary concerned according to the estimated budget  (Annex 2)  — depending on the 
seriousness of the infringement.  
If, within five years of the first infringement being established, the beneficiary commits the 
same  infringement again, the rate may be increased to between 4% and 20% . 
The decision to apply an administrative sanction may be publish ed on the Commission/Agency  
websites (— together with the name of the person responsible for the misconduct,  information on  
the misconduct and the duration of the exclusion and/or amount of the financial penalty).  
When deciding on publishing this information or not, the Commission/Agency will take into 
account, in particular:  
 the seriousness of the misconduct (including impact  on the EU financial interest and 
image)  
 the time that has elapsed since it took place  
 the duration and recurrence of the misconduct  ARTICLE 45 — ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS  
In addition to contractual measures, the [Agency or the]  Commission may also adopt administrative 
sanctions under Articles 106 and 131(4) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 (i.e. exclusion from future 
procurement contracts, grants, prizes and expert contracts and/or financial penalties).  
 
  Admin istrative sanctions (financial  penalties  and/or exclusion from future procurement contracts, 
grants and expert contracts ) are public law measures  (i.e. taken directly on the basis of Articles 10 6 and 
131(4) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 )  that may be applied in addition  to the contractual 
measures (i.e. cost rejection, grant reduction, recovery, suspension and termination), for serious 
misconducts   (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud,  serious breach of obligations, bankruptcy, non-
compliance with tax or social security  obligations , grave professional misconduct,  fraud, corruption, or 
criminal/illegal activity ). 
Examples:  plagiarism; absence  of time  recording systems (although required); false declaration concerning 
SME status.

 the measures taken by the beneficiary to remedy the situation . 
 
2. Procedure  
The Commission/Agency will follow the procedures set out in 106 of the Financial Regulation No 
966/2012  (i.e. contradictory procedure , panel, decision) . 
If the Commission/Agenc y imposes a financial penalty, it will also issue a debit note to recover 
the amount .  
If the penalty is not paid by the date set out in the debit note , late-payment interest will be added 
to the amount to be recovered.  
However, there is NO:  
 intervention of the Guarantee Fund  
 joint and several liability of linked third parties.  
 
Specific case (administrative sanctions ): 
International organisations  — Decisions on administrative sanctions  (and other public law 
decisions) will not be taken against internation al organisations, where this would be contrary to 
the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents or international law (see 
Article 53.2 ).

ARTICLE 46 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Liability for damages  (EU) 
The Commission/Agency can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the GA — its own services 
cause  damage (to a beneficiary or third party).  
Moreover, t he Commission/Agency can  NOT be held liable if — in implementing the GA — a 
beneficiary  or third party involved in the action causes damage (to another beneficiary or  third 
party). 
Example s:  
1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the local river.  
2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action . 
Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded.  
Non-liability  extends to damages caused by third part ies involved in the action (i.e. linked third 
parties, third parties providing in -kind contributions, subcontractors etc.; see Article 8 ). SECTION 2  LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES

2. At a meeting on Commission premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.   
 
2. Procedure  
The Commission/Agency will follow the  normal procedure for damages claims (i.e. bringing an 
action for contractual damages before the  European Court of Justice ; not direct claim via a debit 
note) .   46.2 Liability of the beneficiaries  
Except in case of force majeure (see  Article 51 ), the beneficiaries must compensate the 
[Commission] [Agency]  for any damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because 
the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement.

ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Suspension of the payment deadline  (EU) 
The Commission/Agency may stop the clock (suspend the deadline) if a payment request cannot 
be immediately approved, on the grounds listed in this Article.  
 
 
 
 
Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline ( EU): 
 Payment request does not comply with the provisions of the GA 
The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any of their 
documents) do not fulfil the requirements set out in Article 20 .  
 Suspension of the payment deadline  must be distinguished from suspension of payments  (see 
Article 48 ). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure regarding the request for paymen t. 
Suspension of payments is a measure to avoid making payments to a beneficiary which is, for example, 
suspected of serious misconducts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 SECTION 3  SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION  
ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
47.1 Conditions  
The [Commission] [Agency]  may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see  Article 21.2 to 
21.4) if a request for payment (see  Article 20 ) cannot be approved because:  
(a) it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see  Article 20 );  
(b) the technical reports or financial reports have not been submitted or are not complete or additional 
information is neede d, or 
(c) there is doubt about the eligibility of the costs declared in the financial statements and additional 
checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary.  
47.2 Procedure  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will formally notify the coordinator of the suspens ion and the reasons why.  
The suspension will take effect  the day notification is sent by the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Article 52 ).  
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted  — 
and the remaining period will resume.  
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the [Commission] [Agency]  if the 
suspension will  continue.  
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non -compliance of the technical or financial reports 
(see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected,  
the [Commission][Agency]  may also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see  
Article 50.3.1(l) ). 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 47  320 Examples:  the certificate on the financial statements does not com ply with the template; 
inconsistencies in the technical report (meaning that the action cannot be assessed); the financial 
statement contains errors.  
 Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification  
The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any of their 
documents) are incomplete or it needs additional information.  
Examples:  the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting documents 
are missing; the information in the periodic technical r eport is incomplete; additional information 
on the coordinator's new bank account is needed  
 Doubts on the eligibility of costs in the financial statements that require additional 
verifications  
The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g. due to 
audit findings in other grants)  on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements and 
additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are needed.  
Example:  The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action tasks 
described in the technical report.  
In practice, s uspension is needed if there are issues with the payment request or with the costs 
declared which make it impossible for  the Commission/Agency to comply with the payment 
deadline  (i.e. for interim payments and payment of the balance: 90 days  after payment 
request;  see Article 21 ). 
Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing suspension) is sent to the coordinator 
(and ends  on the day it is lifted).  
Late payment  without suspension  of the payment deadline gives rise to late -payment interest  
for the beneficiaries  (see Article 21.11 ). 
 
2. Procedure  
The Commission/Agency will immediately formally notify the coordinator of the suspension of the 
payment deadline and explain the reasons why.  
There is NO ex ante  contradictory procedure. However, if the suspension e xceeds two months , 
the coordinator may ask the Commission/Agency if the suspension is to be continued (i.e. ask to 
confirm it or lift it).  
 
3. Effects  
If the issues have been resolved satisfactorily  (e.g. the coordinator sent the requested 
information or re-submitted the report)  or the Commission/Agency has finished the necessary 
verifications (e.g. an audit),  it will lift the suspension  and formally notify the coordinator.  
Suspension will normally last until it is possible to make all the necessary check s and verifications 
that are needed for the payment ( e.g. analysis of technical reports and financial statements, 
eligibility of claimed costs, calculation of amount to be paid, approval and authorisation of 
payment ). 
With the lifting of the suspension , the remaining payment period starts to run again.  
If a deadline has been suspended for several  reasons, it will be lifted only when the consortium 
has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

 ARTICLE 48 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS   
48.1 Conditions  
The [Commission] [Agency]  may — at any moment — suspend payments, in whole or in part and for one or 
more beneficiaries, if:  
(a) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) has 
committed or is suspected of having committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or  during the award procedure 
(including improper implem entation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
to provide required information, breach of ethical principles) or  
(b) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) has 
committed — in other EU  or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact on 
this grant ( extension of findings from other grants to this grant ; see Article 22.5.2).  
If payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the [Commission][Agency]  will make partial 
payment(s) for the part(s) not suspended. If suspension concerns the payment of the balance,  — once 
suspension is lifted — the payment  or the recovery of the amount(s) concerned will be considered the 
payment  of the balance that closes the action.  
48.2 Procedure  
Before suspending payments, the [Commission] [Agency]  will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary 
concerned:   
- informing it of its intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
 If the [Commission] [Agency]  does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observat ions it has received , it will formally notify  confirmation  of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
formally notify that the suspension procedure is not continued.  
The suspension will take effect  the day the confirmation notification is sent by the [Commissi on][Agency] .  
If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted . The [Commission] [Agency]  
will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned . 
During the suspension, the periodic report(s) for all reporting periods except the last one (see  Article 20.3) 
must not contain any individual financial statements from the beneficiary concerned [and its linked third 
parties] . The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if 
suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report.  
The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action (see Article 49 .1) or terminate the Agreement 
or the participation of the beneficiary concerned (see Article 50.1  and 50.2). 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 48  322 1. Suspension of payments (EU) 
The Commission/Agency may suspend pre -financing , interim payments or the final payment  (for 
one or more or for all beneficiaries ), on the grounds listed in this Article.  
 
 
 
Grounds for suspension of payments  (EU): 
 Substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
grant)  
The Commission/Agency may suspend payments, if a beneficiary has committed or is 
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations — either during the award procedure or under the GA.  
Example:  false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding  
 Substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud  OR serious breach of obligations (in 
other grants)  
The Commission/Agency may also suspend payments,  if such substantial errors, 
irregularities - or, fraud or serious breach of obligations  were found in other  grants , if  
 the other grants were awarded under sim ilar conditions and  
 the substantial errors, irregularities  or  fraud or serious breach of obligations  are:  
 systemic or recurrent and  
 have a material impact on this grant.  
Example:  During an audit of other grants, the Commission detect ed systemic irregularities  in the 
calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other GAs signed by the audited beneficiary . The 
Commission may suspend  all outstanding payments  for the audited beneficiary  until the issue is 
resolved . 
Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the coordinator 
(and ends  on the day it is lifted).   
If necessary, the consortium may also decide to:  
 suspend the GA  (see Article 49 )  
 terminate the GA or the participation of the beneficiary concerned (see Article 50 ). 
 
2. Procedure  
Before suspending payments, the Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure . 
Contradictory procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
Step 2 —  The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on just ified request — if submitted within the 30 days.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
confirms  it. 
Depending on the situation and type of suspension, this procedure will be directed either at the 
coord inator or the beneficiary concerned : 
 suspension linked to the consortium: normally the coordinator  
 Suspension of payments  has NO impact on the action implementation. T he consortium must continue 
to work on the action, while addressing the issues that have led to suspension of the payment; costs 
incurred during suspension of payments are in principle eligible.  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 >  Article 48  323  suspension linked to a beneficiary (e.g. simultaneous suspension of payments in 
several grants  after a  beneficiary  audit): normally the beneficiary concerned.  
If it is directed at  the coordinator, the coordinator must make sure that  the other members of the 
consortium  are informed  and ask for their comments.  
If it is directed at  the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator later on (in a 
way that preserves confidentiality) .  
 
 
 
 
3. Effects  
During suspension, NO individual financial statements  may be submitted for the beneficiary 
(or beneficiaries) concerned  with the periodic report s (except with the report for the last reporting 
period) . 
Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible  and may be 
included in the next financial report , after suspension has been lifted.  They must be included in 
the periodic report for the last reporting period (— even if suspension is still ongoing).  
Technical reports  submitted during suspension must include the work of the beneficiaries 
concerned.  
Example:  
1 May:  the Commission informs the coordinator of its intention to suspend interim payments for 
beneficiary  B because an  audit for other H2020 grants has detected systematic substantial errors in 
the calculation of its personnel costs.   
15 May:  the coordinator comments that beneficiary B was not aware of its obligations in this respect.  
1 June:  the Commission rejects the comments and confirms the suspension of payments for beneficiary B.  
1 July:  the coordinator submits all reports except the individual financial statement for beneficiary B 
(covering an amount of EUR 75 000).  
10 August:  the Commiss ion pays for all beneficiaries except B.  
25 October: the Commission approves remedial measures taken by beneficiary B (correcting the substantial 
errors and submitting revised financial statements) and lifts the suspension. The costs of 
beneficiary B will be submitted in the next reporting period.  
If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the action , the 
Commission/Agency  will make  a partial payment of the balance for the amount that is not 
suspended ( — but ONLY after having  received all the necessary information for the final 
calculati ons for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries) . 
 
 
 
 
 The partial final payment is NOT the payment that closes the act ion. That p ayment will be made only 
after the payment suspensions are lifted.  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Information obligation — Beneficiaries do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them to 
submit comments. However, they should inform them if there is the risk of a significant impact on the 
action (see Article 17.2 ).

1. GA su spension (consortium ) 
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in this Article.  
 
 
 
Ground for GA suspension (consortium ): 
 Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult)  
The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation becomes 
impossible or excessively difficult.  
Example:  A fire devastates a beneficiary’s laboratory, with  most of the technical equipment and 
computers used for the action and containing the research results. The beneficiaries therefore 
request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the laboratory is 
restored.  
Suspension starts on the day the Commission/Agency receives the notification (and ends  on the 
resumption date specified in the amendment  after resumption ).  
 GA s uspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action implementation, to fix 
specific problems.  It should NOT be used in situations that can not be resolved through a temporary 
interruption ; in these cases, it may be better to terminate  the GA  (see Article 50 ). 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries  
49.1.1 Conditions  
The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
— in particular force majeure (see Article 51 ) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.  
49.1.2 Procedure  
The coordinator must immediately formally notify to the [Commission][Agency] the suspension (see  Article 
52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the expected date of resumption.  
The suspension will take effect  the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency] . 
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately formally notify 
the [Commission][Agency] and request an amendment  of the Agreement to set the date on which the action 
will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to 
the new situation (see Article 55 ) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has been 
terminated (see Article 50 ). 
The suspension will be lifted  with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
This date may be befo re the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6 ).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49.1  325  
 
 
 
 
2. Procedure  
The coordinator  must immediately formally notify  the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & 
Tenders Portal ). 
 
3. Effects  
The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage  and do their 
best to resume ( i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible.  
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the acti on) are NOT 
eligible (see Article 6.5 ). Costs may again be incurred  for the action, once action implementation 
is resumed.  
If the action can be  continued  (resumed), the coordinator must  notify it to the 
Commission/Agency by  request ing an amendment to the GA .  
The amendment must be requested in accordance with Article 55  (e.g. it must be signed by 
the coordinator’s LSIGN) .  
It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the 
action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods) . 
If the Commission/Agency approves the amendment, t he suspension is lifted and will be 
resumed as from the resumption date  set out in the amendment.  The resumptio n date can 
be retroactive (i.e. back to the date when the problem stopped/issue was clarified).  
Example:  The action was suspended on 24.03.2016  due to weather conditions . Once the conditions 
improve, t he coordinator requests and amendment  to lift the suspension (e.g. after 60 days, on 
22.05.2016 ). Therefore, in accordance with Article 54  of the GA, the action will be resumed as from 
23.05.2016.  
If the suspension is lifted and the action continues, the action’s remaining budget can be used 
for action  implement ation. (Although  it may be that the budget must be lower ed in the 
amendment, to adapt the action to the new situation ). 
Example:  After the suspension, it is decided that not all the tasks described in Annex 1 will be 
implemented.  
If the action  (or part of it) can NOT be continued  (or the Commission /Agency  does not approve 
the amendment; see Article 55 ), the GA (or the participation of one or more beneficiaries) may be 
terminated.  
If the suspension leads to GA termination, NO further costs  (incurred after the date of 
suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports  (see Article 6.1 ). 
Example:  The action starts on 1.1.2015 and is to last 36  months. The action’s implementation is 
suspended for four months, from the date after the Commission is notified, 1.12.2015 to 31.3.2016 and 
the suspension leads to the  GA termination. The eligible costs are:  
 costs incurred from the action’s start (1.1.20 15) until the date of notification (30.11.2015)  
 costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.   
 Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may also have to 
take other measures under the GA (e.g. inform  the Commission/Agency under  Article 17.2 ; notify  a situation 
of force majeure under Article 51 ).

 49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency]  
49.2.1 Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency] may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it if:  
(a) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) has 
committed or is suspected of having committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities, or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations  under the Agreement or during the award procedure 
(including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
to provide req uired information, breach of ethical principles);  
(b) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) has 
committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
recurren t errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact on 
this grant ( extension of findings  from other grants to this grant ; see Article 22.5.2 ), or 
(c) the action is suspected of having lost  its scientific or technological relevance.  
49.2.2 Procedure  
Before suspending implementation of the action, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the 
coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
- informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation  and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observations it has received, it will formally no tify confirmation  of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
formally notify that the procedure is not continued.  
The suspension will take effect  five days after confirmation notification is received (or on a later date 
specified in the notification).  
It will b e lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be 
amended to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend th e duration of the action and make 
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55 ) — unless the  
Agreement has already been terminated (see Article 50 ). 
The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
Costs incurred during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6). 
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 46 ). 
Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to terminate the 
Agreement o r participation of a beneficiary (see Article 50 ), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly paid 
(see Articles 43  and 44).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49.2  327 
 
1. GA su spensi on (EU) 
The Commission /Agency may suspend the action  (in full or in part), on the grounds listed in this 
Article.  
Grounds for  GA suspension (EU): 
 Substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
grant)  
The Commission/Agency may suspend the action , if a beneficiary has committed or is 
suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations  — either during the award procedure or under the GA  
Example:  false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding   
 Substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud  OR serious breach of obligations (in 
other grants)  
The Commission/Agency may also suspend the action , if such substantial errors, 
irregularities  or fraud or serious breach of obligations  were found in other  grants , if  
 the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and  
 the substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud or serious breach of obligations  are:  
 systemic or recurrent and  
 have a material impact on this grant.  
Example:  During an audit of other grants , the Commission detected systematic irregularities  in the 
calculation of personnel costs that also  affect all other GAs signed by the audited beneficiary.  The 
Commission may suspend the audited beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolv ed.  
 Loss of  scientific or technological relevance  
The Commission/Agency may suspend the action, if i t needs time to assess whether the 
action has lost scientific or technological relevance.  
This may in particular be the case:  
 if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for 
amendment  
 if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan  
 if a key beneficiary leaves the action and the consortium needs time to find a 
replacement  
 after a check, audit or review of the action.  
Example:  There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as describ ed in Annex 
1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This may jeopardise its technological 
relevance and the Commission decides to suspend its implementation and to carry out a review . 
Suspension starts 5 days after it is notified to the coordinator (or on a later date specified in the 
notification) and ends  on the resumption date specified in the amendment signed by the 
Commission/Agency).  
 
2. Procedure  
Before suspending the GA, the Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure . 
Contradictory procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49.2  328 Step 2 —  The coordi nator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
confirms  it. 
Depending on the situation and type of suspension, this procedure will be directed either at the 
coordinator or the beneficiary concerned : 
 suspension linked to the consortium: normally the coordinator  
 suspension linked to a beneficiary (e.g. simultaneous suspension of several grants  after 
a beneficiary audit): normally the  beneficiary  concerned.  
If it is directed at  the coordinator , the coordinator  must make sure that the other members of the 
consortium are informed  and ask for their comments.  
If it is directed at  the beneficiary concerned, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator 
later on  (in a way that preserves confidentiality) .  
 
 
 
 
If possible, the Commission/Agency will give an estimation of how long the suspension  will be 
needed . 
 
3. Effects  
During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are NOT 
eligible (see Article 6.5 ). Costs may again be declared  for the action, once the action is resumed.  
If the action  can be  continued , the Commission/Agency wi ll lift the suspension and formally 
notify the coordinator  (together with the suspension end date). 
The suspension can be lifted retroactively  (i.e. back to the date when the problem 
stopped/issue was clarified).  
The coordinator must then request an amendment to the GA  (see Article 55 ), to set the 
resumption date  in the tools and adapt the grant to the new situation (e.g. by  extending the 
action duration modifying  Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods) . 
If the action  (or part of it) can NOT be continued , the GA (or the beneficiary  concerned ) may 
be terminated . 
If the suspension leads to the GA termination, NO further costs  (incurred after the date of 
suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports  (see Article 6.1 ). 
Example:  
A key beneficiary is suspected of having declared as eligible personnel costs under the GA the costs of 
personnel employed by another company. The Commission suspends the implementation of the action 
in order to carry out checks. During that period of susp ension, the beneficiary withdraws from the 
action. The consortium cannot find a replacement for this beneficiary and terminates the GA in 
accordance with Article 50.1 . 
The GA starts on 1.5.2015 and lasts 42 months.  
The Commis sion suspends its implementation.  
The coordinator confirms having received notification of the suspension on 18.3.2017.  
The suspension takes effect on 23.3.2017.  
On 23.6.2017, the consortium formally notifies the  GA termination.  
 Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators  or ask 
them to submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact 
on the action (see Article 1 7.2).

The Commission will reject the ineligible personnel costs.  
Ineligible  costs will be rejected . The grant  may be reduced , if the termination is based on  
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations ( for instance  if the 
action has not been implemented properly; see Articles 5.3  and 43). In certain cases, t he 
Commission/Agency may also impose administrative  sanctions (i.e. exclusion  and/or 
financial penalties ; see Article 45 ).

The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the GA.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 50 — TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT OR OF THE PARTICIPATION OF 
ONE OR MORE BENEFICIARIES  
50.1 Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiaries  
50.1.1 Conditio ns and procedure  
The beneficiaries may terminate the Agreement.  
The coordinator must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52 ), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification.  
If no reasons are given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers the reasons do not justify termination, the 
Agreement will be considered to have been ‘ terminated improperly ’ 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification . 
50.1.2 Effects  
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i) a periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination; see  Article 20.3) and  
(ii) the final report (see  Article 20.4 ). 
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the reports within the deadline (see above), only costs which 
are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account.  
The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see  
Article 21.4 ) on the basis of the reports submitted. Only costs incurred until termination are eligible (see  
Article 6 ). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination are not eligible.  
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43 ). 
After termination, the beneficiaries ’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
 
 
 GA termination should be a last -resort  measure , if all efforts to continue the action fail.  
If action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it may be better not to 
terminate the GA , but to suspend it (see Article 49 ). In this case, the GA would only be terminated if it turns 
out later that implementation cannot be resumed anymore.  
Example: A fire devastates a laboratory where most of the technical equipme nt and computers used in the 
action are stored.  If the beneficiaries consider that the laboratory can be replaced and the action will still be 
correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new laboratory is operational. 
However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find a new laboratory and therefore it is 
impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate the GA.  
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.1  331 Grounds for GA termination ( consortium ): 
 Any ground that justifies  early termination of the action  
The beneficiaries may terminate the GA i n principle on any ground  — as long as there is a 
good reason  (e.g. circumstances make its implementation impossible or excessively 
difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological relevance; force majeure) . 
Example s:  
1. The consortium decides to terminate the GA due to technical difficulties that result in the 
action no longer being viable .  
2. The consortium  request s termination because the action was finished ahead of schedule . 
If there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, t he Commission/Agency can 
NOT oppose , but termination will be considered improper . 
 
 
This will be the case, for instance, if:  
 the implementation of the action has become impossible or excessively 
difficult due to the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence  
 the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of t he 
beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties  
 implementation would have been possible if the beneficiaries had made 
more (but still reasonable) efforts.   
Example:  The beneficiaries decide to terminate the GA due to inte rnal communication 
and decision -making problems within the consortium, and notify the Commission via the 
coordinator. The Commission considers that these internal problems have jeopardised the 
action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the GA because they could have 
been solved within the consortium on the basis of the consortium agreement. This 
improper termination may  lead to  a grant reduction.  
 
2. Procedure  
The coordinator must formally notify  the Commission/Agency ( via the Funding & Tenders Portal ) 
of the termination — on behalf of the  other  beneficiaries . 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should  contact the Commission/Agency beforehand, to d iscuss the 
termination.  
The notification must specify the date on which t ermination will take effect (termination date ). 
This date  must be a date after the notification : Terminations can not be retroactive  (notably to 
be able to comply with  the obligations and deadlines after termination ; see point 3 ). 
 
3. Effects  
The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit  the necessary reports  (i.e. a periodic report 
for the open reporting period until termination and the final report).  
The Commission/Agency  will calculate  the final grant amount  and the payment of the  
balance (see Articles 5.3  and 21.4).  
If the total amount of earlier payments (pre -financing payment and interim payments, if any) 
received before termination:  
 Improper termination  of the GA may lead to a grant reduction (see (see Articles 5.3  and 
43).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.1  332  is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form of 
a recovery  (see Article 21.4  and 44.1.2 ). 
 is lower than the final grant amount, the Commission/Agency will pay the balance (see 
Article 21.4 ). 
Only costs  incurred before  termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date ; see 
Article 6.1(a) ) are eligible  — except for the:   
 costs for the  report s (see Article 6.1 ) 
Example:  The action’s duration is 36 months. The starting date is 1.1.2016. The notified 
termination date is 1.5.2017. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from 
1.1.2016 to 1.5.2017 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for the 
last reporting period and the final report are eligible  
 costs for  (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before termination  (see 
Article 6.1 ). 
Example:  One of the beneficiaries of the GA has a contract to carry out 8 tests during the action’s 
duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the GA is  terminated. Therefore, 
only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before termination may be eligible for the action.  
If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which termination 
takes effect), costs that are  not included in an approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken 
into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The Commission/Agency will NOT send a 
reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.  
The detailed calculations are described in Article 21 . 
Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply  after the end of 
the action.   
Obligations that continue to apply after the GA is terminated:  
 Keeping records and other supporting documentati on (Article 18.1 ) 
 Submit ting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination) and the final 
report (see Article 50.1.1  and 20) 
 Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (for checks, 
reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact ; see Articles 22  and 23) 
 Comply ing with the rul es on management of intellectual property, background and results 
(see Section 3 of Chapter 4  of the GA )  
 Maintain ing confidentiality (see Article 36) 
 Comply ing with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 37) 
 Promoting  the action and giv ing visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
 No assign ment of  claims for payment (see Article 40) 
 Chapter 6 measures (i.e. rejection of costs (see Article 42 ), grant reduction (see Article 43 ), 
recovery (see Article 44 ).

 MULTI -BENEFICIARY:  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
50.2.1 Conditions and procedure  
The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.  
The coordinator must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52 ) and inform 
the beneficiary concerned.  
If the coordinator’s partici pation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).  
The notification must include:  
- the reasons why;  
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing);  
- the date the termination takes effect. This date must be after the notification, and  
- a request for amendment (see Article 55 ), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and the 
estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned (see Annexes 1 and 2) and, if necessary, the addition 
of one or more new beneficiaries (see  Article 56 ). If termination takes effect after the period set out 
in Article 3, no request  for amendment must be included unless the beneficiary concerned is the 
coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose a new coordinator.  
If this information is not given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers that the reasons do not j ustify 
termination, the participation will be considered to have been terminated  improperly . 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification.  
50.2.2 Effects  
The coordinator must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and  
(ii) if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘ termination report ’ from the 
beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until  termination, containing an overview of 
the progress of the work, an overview of the  use of resources, the individual financial statement 
and, if applicable, the certificate on  the financial statement (see  Article 20.3  and 20.4). 
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting 
period (see Article 20.3 ). 
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commi ssion][Agency] (because it calls into question the 
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Com mission][Agency] , the Agreement is amended  to 
introduce the necessary changes (see  Article 55 ). 
The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the report 
on the distribution of payments —  calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the (pre -
financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary exceed this am ount.

 The amount which is due  is calculated in the following steps:  
Step 1 —  Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by applying the reimbursement 
rate(s) to the total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary [and its linked third parties]  
in the termination report and approved by the [Commission][Agency] .  
Only costs incurred by the beneficiary concerned un til termination takes effect are 
eligible (see Article 6). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after 
termination are not eligible.  
Step 2 —  Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations  
In case of a reduction (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the 
reduced grant amount for the beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction 
(calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or br each 
of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the 
beneficiary.  
If the payments received exceed the amounts due : 
- if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3 and the request for amendment is 
accepted, the beneficiary concerned must repay to the coordinator the amount unduly received. 
The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the amount unduly received and request the 
beneficiary concerned to repay it to the coordinator within 30 days of receiving no tification. If it 
does not repay  the coordinator, the [Commission][Agency] will draw upon the Guarantee Fund 
to pay the coordinator and then notify a debit note  on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the 
beneficiary concerned (see Article 44 ); 
- in all other cases (in particular if termination takes effect after the period set out in Article 3), the 
[Commission][Agency] will formally notify a debit note  to the beneficiary concerned. If 
payment is not made by the date in the debit note , the Guarantee Fund will pay to the 
[Commission][Agency] the amount due and the [Commission][Agency] will notify a debit note 
on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the beneficiary concerned (see  Article 44 ); 
- if the beneficiary co ncerned is the former coordinator, it must repay the new coordinator the 
amount unduly received, unless:  
- termination takes effect after an interim payment and  
- the former coordinator has not distributed amounts received as pre -financing or interim 
payments (see Article 21.7 ). 
In this case, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a debit note  to the former 
coordinator. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will pay to 
the [Commission][Agency] the amount due. The [Commission][Agency] will then pay the new 
coordinator and notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the former coordinator 
(see Article 44 ). 
If the payments received do not  exceed the amounts due : amounts owed to the beneficiary concerned will 
be included in the next interim or final payment.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the termination report within the deadline (see above), only 
costs included in an approve d periodic report will be taken into account.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline 
(see above), it will consider that:

1. Beneficiary  termination (consortium ) 
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of a beneficiary (or of several beneficiaries), if:  
- the beneficiary concerned requests it or  
- the consortium decides to terminate the beneficiary’s participation (using its internal 
decision -making procedures ). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary 
concerned, request the beneficiary’s opinion  in writing  and provide it to the 
Commission/Agency (or — if the beneficiary didn’t reply — provide  proof that the 
beneficiary’s opinion has been requested in writing).  
Grounds for beneficiary  termination ( consortium ): 
 Any ground that justifies  termination of the participation of the beneficiary  
The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium members in 
principle on any ground  — as long as there is a good reason (e.g. withdrawal by a 
beneficiary because due to a  change in ownership ; the beneficiary cannot implement its 
tasks in the same way; bankruptcy ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If there are no legitimate reasons,  the Commission/Agency can NOT oppose  beneficiary  
termination, but it will be considered improper . 
 
 
 
 Improper termination  of the participation of a beneficiary  may lead to GA termination 
(see Article 50.3.1(c) ) and/or to a grant reduction at the payment of the balance (see Articles 
5.3 and 43).  
 
 
 
. 
 - the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that  
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.  
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see  Article 43 ) or termination of t he Agreement 
(see Article 50 ). 
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
 
MONO -BENEFICIARY:  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
Not applicable  
 For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU GAs,  withdrawal from one GA does 
NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others.  
 Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy  (or similar) , the beneficiary  or the 
coordinator must immediately inform the Commission/Agency. Late information  will be 
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the GA (see Article 17.2 ).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.2  336 Termination extends to linked third parties . Terminating a beneficiary’s participation implies that 
its linked third parties’ may NOT continue participating in the action.  
 
 
 
 
2. Procedure  
The coordinator must formally notify  the Commission/Agency of the termination (via the Funding 
& Tenders Portal ). At the same time, the coordinator must inform the beneficiary concerned 
(through the usual communication channels — in writing and offline).  
The notification must include all the information  set out in this Article (including the date the 
termination takes effect) and a request for  an amendment . 
Since for beneficiary  termination the notification  is combined with  an amendment request, they 
must be submitted and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other 
beneficiaries ; see Annex 3) . 
NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action — unless it 
concerns the coordinator  (since the coordinator has many obligations also after the end of the 
action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the payment of the balance and distribute the payment 
among the beneficiaries ).  
The amendment must be requested in accordance with Article 55 .  
If it is accepted,  the GA will be amended to introduce the necessary changes (including, if 
necessary, the addition of new beneficiaries).  
If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the Commission /Agency. If 
a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls into question the 
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment of applicants ), the GA 
may be terminated.  
Example:  A key beneficiary  terminates its participation in the GA. The consortium cannot find a 
replacement and cannot continue implementing the action without one.  
The notification must specify the date on which termination will take effect  (termination date ). 
This date must be a date after the notification : Terminations can not be retroactive  (notably to 
be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination; see point 3 ). 
 
3. Effects  
If the GA continues  (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the consortium (and any new 
beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the action as described in Annex 1 
(see Article 41.1 ). They must carry out the action (including the part that the defaulting 
beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional funding  to do so ) — unless the 
Commission/Agency expressly agrees otherwise .  
The coordinator must — within 30 days — submit  the necessary reports  (i.e. a report on the 
distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and a termination report).   
In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be  submitted by the new coordinator  (to 
avoid problems with the payment) . If the nomination of the new coordinator  takes more time , the 
30 days deadline may be extended.  
The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the 
periodic report  for the next reporting period.  
 Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to fully participate in action s, like beneficiaries .   
Linked third parties can NOT however do more than the beneficiary they are linked to: If their beneficiary is 
terminated, they must also leave the action . 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.2  337 The Commission/Agency will calculate  the amoun t due to the terminated beneficiary :  
 if the Commission/Agency owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be 
paid with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final)  
 if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the conso rtium . 
Only costs  incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date  see 
Article 6.1(a) ) are eligible  — except for the:   
 costs for the termination report  (see Article 6.1) 
 costs for (the part of) contracts or subcontracts delivered before termination (see 
Article 6.1 ). 
If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report  (within the 30 days of the date on which 
termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report will 
NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The Commission/Agency will NOT 
send a written remi nder and will not extend the deadline.  
If the coordinator fails to submit the report on the distribution of payments , the terminated 
beneficiary whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts.  
The detailed calculations are described  in Article 21 . 
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply  after the end of 
the action (see Article 50.1 ).  
 
Specific cases ( beneficiary  termination):  
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement  — The decision to terminate the 
coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision -making 
procedures) . The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the benefi ciaries (acting 
on behalf of the other beneficiaries ; see Article 55 ) and the reports must be submitted by the new 
coordinator  (to avoid problems with the payment ). If needed, the 30 days deadline for submission of 
the reports can be extended (see above) . 
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the coordinator 
must be changed . If the coordinator  can no longer submit the request , the same procedure as for 
coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above and Article 55 ). 
Exceptionally, at the end of the action it may not be necessary to change the coordinator , but only its  
bank a ccount if the administrator/liquidator  accepts to do the final transfers of amounts .

22.5.2;  
(n) [OPTION 1: despite a specific request by the [Commission][Agency], a beneficiary does not 
request — through  the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of 
one of its linked third parties or international partners that is in one of the situations under points 
(e), (f), (g), (k), (l) or (m) and to reallocate its tasks ][OPTION 2: not applicable].  
50.3.2  Procedure  
Before terminating the Agreement or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the [Commission][Agency] 
will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
- informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and  
- inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and — in case of Point 
(l.ii) above — to inform the [Commission][Agency] of the measures to ensure compliance with the 
obligations under the Agreement.  
If the [Commission][Agency ] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observations it has received, it will formally notify to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned  
confirmation  of the termination and the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it  will formally notify that the 
procedure is not continued.  
The termination will take effect : 
- for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j), (l.ii) and (n) above: on the day specified in 
the notification of the confirmation (see above);  
- for ter minations under Points (a), (d), (f), (i), (k), (l.i) and (m) above: on the day after the 
notification of the confirmation is received.  
50.3.3 Effects  
(b) for termination of the Agreement : 
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effec t — submit:  
(i) a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination; see  Article 20.3 ) and  
(ii) a final report (see  Article 20.4 ). 
If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see  Articles 20.8  and 
50.3.1(l) ), the coordinator may not submit any reports after termination.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the reports within the deadline (see above), only costs 
which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account.  
The [Commission][Agency] will calculate  the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
(see Article 21.4) on the basis of the reports submitted. Only costs incurred until termination takes 
effect are eligible (see  Article 6 ). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination 
are not eligible.  
This does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to reduce the grant (see Article 43 ) or to 
impose administrative sanctions (Article 45).  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency] (see 
Article 46 ).

 After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
(c) for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries : 
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned;  
(ii) a request for amendment (see Article 55 ), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned (see Annexes 1 and 2) and, if necessary, the 
addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see  Article 56 ). If termination is notified after 
the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the 
beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case the request for amendment must 
propose a new coordinator, and  
(iii) if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a termination report  
from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing 
an overview of the progress of the work, an overview of the use of resources, th e 
individual financial statement and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement 
(see Article 20 ). 
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next 
reporting per iod (see  Article 20.3 ). 
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question 
the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the 
Agree ment may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency] , the Agreement is amended  
to introduce the necessary changes (see  Article 55 ). 
The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if 
the (pre -financing and interim) payments received by the b eneficiary exceed this amount.  
The amount which is due  is calculated in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by applying the reimbursement 
rate(s) to the total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary [and its linked third 
parties]  in the termination report and approved by the [Commission][Agency].  
Only costs incurred by the beneficiary concerned un til termination takes effect are 
eligible (see Article 6). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after 
termination are not eligible.  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations  
In case  of a reduction (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate 
the reduced grant amount for the beneficiary by deducting the amount of the 
reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities 
or fraud or breach of  obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant 
amount for the beneficiary.  
If the payments received exceed the amounts due :

 MONO -BENEFICIARY:  
50.3 Termination of the Agreement, by the [Commission] [Agency]  
[…] - if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3 and the request for 
amendment is accepted, the beneficiary concerned must repay to the coordinator the 
amount unduly received. The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the amount 
undul y received and request the beneficiary concerned to repay it to the coordinator within 
30 days of receiving notification. If it does not repay the coordinator, the 
[Commission][Agency]  will draw upon the Guarantee Fund to pay the coordinator and then 
notif y a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the beneficiary concerned (see  
Article 44 ); 
- in all other cases, in particular if termination takes effect after the period set out in Article 
3, the [Commission][Agency] will fo rmally notify a debit note  to the beneficiary 
concerned. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will 
pay to the [Commission][Agency] the amount due and the [Commission][Agency] will 
notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the beneficiary concerned (see  
Article 44 ); 
- if the beneficiary concerned is the former coordinator, it must repay the new coordinator 
the amount unduly received, unless:  
- termination takes effect after an interim payment and  
- the former coordinator has not distributed amounts received as pre -financing or 
interim payments (see Article 21.7 ) 
In this case, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a debit note  to the former 
coordinator. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will 
pay to the [Commission][Agency] the amount due. The [Commission][Agency] will then 
pay the new coordinator and notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to t he 
former coordinator (see Article 44 ). 
 If the payments received do not exceed the amounts due : amounts owed to the beneficiary 
concerned will be included in the next interim or final payment.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does n ot receive the termination report within the deadline (see above), only 
costs included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline 
(see above), it will consider that:  
- the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned, and that  
- the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator.  
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in  particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3  342 1. GA or beneficiary termination (EU) 
The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA or the participation of one (or more) of the 
beneficiaries, on the grounds  listed in this Article.  
 
 
 
 
 
Grounds for termination  (EU): 
 Non-accession to the GA   
The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if one (or more)  beneficiar ies did not 
accede to the GA (i.e.  did not sign the Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into 
force of the GA  or did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability ). 
Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically le ad to the GA termination; the 
consortium can find an alternative solution that ensure s the proper implementation of the 
action without the beneficiary  (and request an amendment; see Article 55 ).  
In this case, the Commission/Agency will terminate the GA only if it considers the  
solution inappropriate or if the consortium  no longer complies with the eligibility 
conditions  set out General Annexes A and C to the H2020  Work Programme  (e.g. the 
rules regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries , their legal situation, or their place 
of establishment) . 70 
Example s: 
1. Three entities from Poland, Portugal and France, are going to participate in a GA. The 
French beneficiary does not accede to the GA, and the other two beneficiaries fail to find a 
solution to this. The Commission terminates the GA because the conditi ons set out in the work 
programme /call are not met (i.e. the rule that three legal entities must take part) . 
2. A key beneficiary does not take part in the action after all; the assessment of the action 
based on the award criteria announced in the call for proposals would  have had a different 
result.  
 Change in a beneficiary’s situation  
The Commission/Agency may te rminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there has been 
a change to its (or one of its linked third parties’) legal, financial, technical, organisational 
or ownership situation, that is likely to substantially affect or delay the action’s  
implementation  or calls into question the decision to award the grant.  
Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or outside 
circumstances.  
Example s:  
1. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non -European company (not entitled to participate 
due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action’s implementation and the ownership, 
protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results.  The Commission decides to terminate the 
beneficiary’s participation in the GA (or the GA if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to 
replace it).  
2. The country in which one of the beneficiaries is established ceases to be an EU Member State. 
This means that the beneficiary is no longer eligible for funding and that the decision to award the 
grant is called into question. The Commission may decide to terminate the beneficiary’s 
participation in the GA (or the GA  if the other beneficiaries fail to  find a solution to replace it) . 
 
 
 
 GA cannot be amended  after  termination  of a beneficiary’s participation  
                                            
70  See also Article 8 of the Rules for Participation  Regulation No 1290/2013 . 
 Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination , if the Commission/Agency considers that the GA 
can NOT be continued (see Article 50.3.1(c)) . 
 The GA may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination would call into question the the decision 
awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article 6 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3  343 The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if it cannot be amended after termination 
of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary changes to the GA would call into 
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of the equal tre atment of 
applicants; see Article 55 ). 
The GA may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination would call into question the 
the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
 Action c an no longer be implemented   
The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if action implementation is prevented by 
force majeure or the action implementation is  suspended and resumption is not possible or 
the necessary amendment is not acceptable (see Articles 49  and 55).  
Example:   
1. A fire devastates a laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers with the 
action’s research data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to rebuild 
the laboratory. The Commission carries out a review after the force majeure takes place and 
concludes that the consortium can no longer implement the action. It therefore decides to 
terminate the GA.  
2. A beneficiary that has the necessary background to work on the action and owns the 
installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its participation. 
The Commission decides to terminate the GA because continuing implementing the action without 
this ben eficiary calls into question the decision awarding the grant.  
 Bankruptcy, winding -up, administration , arrangement with creditors, suspension 
of business activities  or other similar proceedings   
The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a ben eficiary, if it is declared 
bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, has entered into 
an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to any other 
similar proceedings or procedures under natio nal law (since this normally implies that the 
beneficiary cannot carry out the work properly).  
Example:  A coordinator informs the Commission that a beneficiary participating in a GA is 
insolvent. It does not notify  beneficiary  termination because it thinks that the beneficiary may 
continue implementing the action. The Commission considers that the beneficiary has not sufficient 
means to pursue implementation and terminates the beneficiary’s participation.  
 
 
 
 
 Professional misconduct  
The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or one of its 
representatives) has been found guilty of professional misconduct (proven by any means).  
Example:  A legal entity’s participation in a GA is terminated when a  national  investigation 
uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies.  
 Non-complia nce with tax or social security obligations  
The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it has not 
fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under national law (i.e. 
the law of the country in which it is established and those of the countr y where the action is 
implemented; see Article 7 ). 
Example:  A national administration notifies to the Commission/Agency that a beneficiary did not 
pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it paid these 
contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the Commission may terminate its 
participation in the GA.  
 Loss of scientific or technological relevance  
The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if the action has l ost scientific or 
technological relevance.  
Example:  A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered material  is 
selected . After the action starts, a European scientific publication demonstrates that this material 
 Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy  (or similar) , the beneficiary  or the 
coordinator must immediately inform the Commission/Agency. Late information  will be 
considered as a breach of the information obligation under the GA (see Article 17.2 ).

H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3  344 contains a chemical substance that irremediably harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot 
continue and the Commission decides to terminate the GA.  
 Specific grounds for joint actions   
For joint actions (i.e. actions funded following a joint  or coordinated  call with a th ird country 
or international organisation  (IO); see Article 2 ), the Commission/Agency may terminate 
the GA, if:  
 the third country /IO action does not start by the date specified in Annex 1  
In this  case, NO costs incurred by the consortium will be accepted. Any pre-
financing provided to the consortium  must be returned to the Commission /Agency  
in full . 
 the third country /IO action is terminated  
 the third country /IO action can no longer contribute to the subject of the GA.  
Example:  if the coordination agreement is not signed . 
 Fraud, corruption or other criminal activities  
The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or one of its 
representatives) has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, 
money laundering or any other illegal activity.  
Example:  A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner is 
convicted by national courts to have participated in large -scale drug trafficking . 
 Substan tial errors, irregularities  or fraud  OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
grant)  
The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA or the participation of a beneficiary, if a 
beneficiary (or one of its representatives) has committed substantial errors, irregularities  or 
fraud or serious breach of obligations  — either during the award procedure or under the GA . 
Example:  false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding; coordinator does 
not transfer payments to the other beneficiaries , but uses them for itself; coordinator does not 
submit the reports (despite  a reminder); consortium does not  inform the Commission/Agency 
about the receipt of a second grant for the same/ similar proposal ; review shows that action does 
not achieve its crit ical objectives and is way behind schedule and consortium submits a short -term 
implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows that beneficiary declared costs based on 
fake invoices; consortium does not provide requested information (despite a reminder);  a check 
shows that scientific reports submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web 
(plagiarism ); consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination . 
 Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  OR serious breach of obligations (in 
other grants)  
The Commission/Agency may also terminate the GA or the participation of a beneficiary , if 
such substantial errors, irregularities - or, fraud or serious breach of obligations  were found 
in other  grants, if  
 the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and  
 the substantial errors, irregularities or  fraud or serious breach of obligations  are:  
 systemic or recurrent and  
 have a material impact on this grant.  
Example:  During an audit of other grants, the Commission detected systematic irregularities in the 
calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all other GAs signed by the 
audited beneficiary. The Commission may terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in  
the GA.  
 Non-removal of a linked third party /international partner  
 
The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses to 
remove one of its linked third parties or an international partner which is in one of the 
following situations:   
 
- bankruptcy, winding -up, administration, arrangement with creditors, suspension of 
business activities or other similar proceedings;  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > S ection 3 > Article 50.3  345 - professional misconduct  
- non-compliance with tax or social security obligati ons 
- fraud, corruption or other criminal activities  
- substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud or serious breach of obligations (in this 
grant or other grants).  
This termination ground was introduced as explicit contractual ground with GA version 3.0. 
For older grant agreements , beneficiary termination /linked third party removal  was however  
already implicitly included in the different grounds of Article 50.3.3 ( given that linked third 
parties have to fulfil the same conditions as the beneficiaries for participating in the action ). 
Before terminating (GA or beneficiary), the Commission/Agency may first suspend the GA (see 
Article 49.2 ), to try to fix the problems and re -establish compliance with the GA. In this case, it 
will only terminate (the GA or a beneficiary) if the action cannot be resumed.  
 
2. Procedure  
Before GA or beneficiar y termination , the Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory 
procedure   
Contradictory procedure:  
Step 1 —  The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
(and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter .  
Step 2 —  The coordinator/beneficiary concerned has 30 days  to submit observations. An 
extension may be granted on just ified request — if submitted within the 30 days.  
Step 3 —  The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
confirms  it. 
Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at the 
coordinator or the beneficiary concerned : 
 terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. GA termination after a negative project 
review) : normally the coordinator  
 terminations linked to a beneficiary (e.g. beneficiary termination or simultaneous 
termination  of GAs  after a beneficiary audit) :  normally the beneficiary concerned.  
If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries offline, via 
its usual communication channels (e.g. e -mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.)  and 
ask for their comments.   
If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the Commission/Agency will inform coordinator later 
on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).  
 
 
 
If a beneficiary  is terminated on the basis of Article 50.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy  or similar) , the 
Commission/Agency will also contact the liquidator/administrator  (— as soon as possible after the 
termination is confirmed) . 
If it confirms termination, the Commission/Agency will specify the date on which termination will 
take effect  (termination date) .  
This date will be a date after the notification : Termination s cannot be retroactive  (notably to 
ensure the fulfilment of obligations and deadlines after termination ; see point 3 ). 
 Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators or ask 
them to submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact on 
the action (see Article 1 7.2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3  346 For some  cases, the Commission/Agency may choose a future  date (in order to give the 
beneficiaries the possibility to close the action). For the other cases  (e.g. termination under 
points (a), (d), (f), (i), (k), (l.i) and (m)) , the termination will take effect immediately, i.e. on 
the day after the coordinator receives the notification  of the confirmation  (see Article 50.3.2 ).  
 
3. Effects  
The effects of GA terminat ion are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate the GA (see 
Article 50.1.2 ). 
Only costs  incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date; see 
Article 6.1(a) ) are eligible.  Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination 
are not eligible.  
Ineligible costs will be rejected . The grant  may be reduced , if the termination is based on  
substantial errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations ( for instance  if the 
action has not been implemented properly; see Articles 5.3  and 43). In certain cases, t he 
Commission/Agency may also impose administrative  sanctions (i.e. exclusion  and/or  
financial penalties ; see Article 45 ). 
The effects of beneficiary terminati on are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate one of 
their partners  (see Article 50.2.2 ). 
The detailed calculations are described in Article 21 . 
Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply  after the end of 
the action (see Article 50.1 ). 
 
Specific case : 
Termination of the coordinator — The amendment request must be made by one of the beneficiaries 
(acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 55 ) and the reports must be submitted by the 
new coordinator . If needed, the 6 0 days deadline for submissi on of the reports can be extended.

SECTION 4  FORCE MAJEURE  
ARTICLE 51 — FORCE MAJEURE  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Force majeure  
What?  In case of force majeure, a party will be  excused from not fulfilling its obligations  (i.e. 
there will be  no breach of obligations under the GA and none of the adverse measures for breach 
of contract will be applied ). 
‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s control 
and that prevents it from fulfilling its obli gations under the GA.  
Examples (force majeure):  An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in delivering 
equipment due to floods in the region/country.  
Examples (not force majeure):  machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building  a test site 
went bankrupt.  
 SECTION 4  FORCE MAJEURE  
ARTICLE 51 — FORCE MAJEURE  
51.1 Force majeure  
‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that:  
- prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement,  
- was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control,  
- was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of third parties involved in the 
action ), and  
- proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence.  
The following cannot be invoked as force majeure:  
- any default of a service, defect in equipment or material or delays in making them available, 
unless they stem directly from a releva nt case of force majeure,  
- labour disputes or strikes, or  
- financial difficulties.  
Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party  without delay, stating 
the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects.  
The parties m ust immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do 
their best to  resume implementation of the action as soon as possible.  
The party prevented by force majeure from fulfilling its obligations under the Agreement  cannot be 
considered in breach of them.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 4 > Article 51  348 The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of 
care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of 
its obligations under the GA ) and u nforeseeable. Force majeure can  NOT be used to justify  
situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence or by events that could reasonably have been 
anticipated.  
The following cases are explicitly NOT considered force majeure:  
 default of a service, defect in equipment or material or delays in making them availabl e 
— unless they stem directly from a relevant case of force majeure  
 labour disputes or strikes  
 financial difficulties.  
Personal reasons (e.g. sickness)  or internal instructions are in general NOT considered as 
cases of force majeure.  
If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action, it will normally be the 
beneficiaries that must bear them (since they were not budgeted and the maximum grant amount 
set out in Article 5 .1 cannot be increased).  
 New in  Horizon 2020 : If a task could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but 
certain costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be 
eligible. This is different from FP7, where only costs for tasks that had actually been executed up 
to the date of the force majeure were eligible.  
Example:  Airline tickets bought for a beneficiary to attend a meeting related to the action. The flight is 
cancelled d ue to a volcano eruption, making it impossible for the beneficiary to travel to the meeting. If the 
ticket costs fulfil the eligibility conditions set out under Article 6  of the GA, they are eligible, even if the 
beneficiary di d not travel and did not take part in the meeting.  
Force majeure may lead to GA suspension (see Article 49 ) or GA termination (see Article 50 ). 
How?  The coordinator must immediately formally notify  the Commission/Agency  (via the 
Funding & Tenders Portal ).  
The beneficiary  concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit  the damage  
caused by t he force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

ARTICLE 52 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CHAPTER 7  FINAL PROVISIONS   
ARTICLE 52 — COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES  
52.1 Form  and means of communication  
Communication  under the Agreement (information, requests, submissions, ‘formal notifications’, etc.) must:  
- be made in writing and  
- bear the number of the Agreement.  
All communication must be made through the Participant Portal electronic exchange system and using the 
forms and templates provided there.  
If — after the payment of the balance — the [Commission][Agency] finds that a formal notification was not 
accessed, a second formal notification will be made by registered post wi th proof of delivery (‘formal 
notification on paper ’). Deadlines will be calculated from the moment of the second notification.  
Communications in the electronic exchange system must be made by persons authorised according to the 
Participant Portal Terms & Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have 
designated — before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’ . 
The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in his/her appointment letter (s ee Participant Portal Terms & 
Conditions).   
If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the [Agency and] 
Commission websites.   
52.2 Date of communication  
Communications  are considered to have been made when  they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date 
and time they are sent through the  electronic exchange system).  
Formal notifications  through the  electronic exchange system are considered to have been made when they 
are received by the receiving party  (i.e. on the date and time of acceptance by the receiving party, as 
indicated by the time stamp). A formal notification that has not been accepted within 10 days after sending 
is considered to have been accepted.  
Formal notifications  on paper sent by registered post  with proof of delivery (only after the payment of the 
balance) are considered to have been made on either:  
- the delivery date registered by the postal service or  
- the deadline for collection at the post office.  
If the  electronic exchange syst em is temporarily unavailable , the sending party cannot be considered in 
breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline.  
52.3 Addresses for communication  
The electronic  exchange system must be accessed via the following URL:  
[insert URL ] 
The [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify the coordinator and beneficiaries in advance any changes to 
this URL.

H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 52  350  
 
 
 
 
 
1. Communicati on between the parties  — Funding & Tenders  Portal e lectronic 
exchange system  
All communication  between the consortium and the Commission/Agency  — before and after the 
payment of the balance — must be in electronic form via the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
Beneficiaries will receive Funding & Tender  Portal notifications even after the end of the action 
(and the LEARs are obliged to keep beneficiary contact data up to date, in order to ensure that 
the communication channels remain active ). 
The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the bene ficiaries.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The communication via the Funding & Tenders  Portal  was extended to  after the payment of the 
balance with GA version 4.0. For older grant agreements,  it is in principle on paper, unless the 
beneficiary agrees to accept communication via the Funding & Tenders  Portal.      
The Funding & Tenders  Portal offers different functions : 
 viewing and changing  the legal entity data in the Participant Register  
 direct  access to the necessary forms and electronic  submiss ion for reporting, deliverables 
and amendments  
 contacting the Commission/Agency , via the messag es function  
 formal notifications  
 where necessary, secured electronic signatures  (for instance, for signing the GA, 
accession to the GA, amendments and financial statements).  
It keeps logs of all communication  and allows for delivery  of formal notifications with proof of 
receipt . 
All messages  are recorded  in the Funding & Tenders  Portal project  file (with date and time).  
Formal notifications are also recorded (with information on when  they were sent and received, 
i.e. date and time the receiving party first accessed the notification, as indicated by the time 
stamp).  Formal notifications  on paper  (only after the payment of the balance) addressed to the official mailing 
address indicated on the  [Commission’s][Agency’s]  website.  
Formal notifications on paper  (only after the payment of the balance) addressed to the beneficiaries  must 
be sent to their  legal address as specified in the Participant Portal Beneficiary Register.  
  Formal notification s are normally considered to have been  accessed  10 days  after  they have 
been sent (— even not actually opened by  recipient , e.g. refusal of reception or omission ). Deadlines 
that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven.  
The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance  — except 
that the Commission/Agency will check that the notification has actually been accesse d by the 
beneficiary (at any time, before or after the 10 days deadline). If it was not accessed, the 
Commission/Agency will send a second notification, this time on paper  by registered post with proof 
of delivery. In that case, the deadlines will start t o run from the date of receipt of the second 
notification.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article  52 351 Access  is limited to persons with a user account  and authorisation  to act for the beneficiary .  
Authorisation and access are linked to the user role (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN ). 
Examples:  
1. Only Legal Signatories  (PLSIGNs) may sign the GA and amendments.  
2. Only Financial Statement Signatories  (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements.  
3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts ( PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit information to 
the Commission.  The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the responsible (project) officer 
in the back -office, while the other roles can be managed by the participant s themselves via the Portal. (In 
case of MSCA -IF the Supervisor identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo, in ERC grants the PI 
identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.)  
4. Only Participant Contacts  (PaCos) may submit information to the coordinator. They cannot submit 
information directly to the Commission /Agency . 
5. Only the Participant Contact (s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal Signatory 
(PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a formal notification for 
the first time (i.e. may formally receive it).  
6. Task Managers  (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to their 
organisation’s participation in the grant. They cannot submit information to the coordinator or the 
Commission.  
7. Team Members (TeMe) have read -only access to project infor mation. They cannot complete or save 
forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the Commission /Agency . 
 
 
In principle, all communications from/to the Commission/Agency must normally go via the 
coordinator  — unless the GA or other rules provide  for direct communication with the other 
beneficiaries  (e.g. Articles 20 , 22, 23, 30, 41, 55; OLAF Regulations  No 883/2013  and No 
2185/2996 ). 
 
Specific case s (PP access rights) : 
Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If during a beneficiary goes bankrupt  during the action , the liquidator 
may be granted the necessary access rights in the Funding & Tenders  Portal , in order to complete the 
beneficiaries' obligations. If exceptionally necessary, the Commission/Agency can also agree to 
communication outside the Funding & Tenders  Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered 
post or e -mails). 
 For more guidance on access and roles in the Funding & Tenders Portal , see the Portal O nline Manual .

ARTICLE 53 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Privileges and immunities  
 The Commission/Agency will not take measures against international organisations  which  would 
be contrary to the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents or 
international law .  
‘International organisation ’ means intergovernmental organisation s (other than the EU) 
with legal personality under international public law (including specialised agencies set up by 
international organisations).  
Examples:  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); International Federation of National Red 
Cross an d Red Crescent Societies  
Thus in most cases (that is to say, unless the applicable  legal texts provide otherwise) , public law 
decisions cannot be applied  to international organisations ; only contractual measures will be 
taken .  
Therefore, the Commission/Agency will not apply enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU  
(see Article 44 ) or decisions on administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion or financial penalties ; 
see Article 45 ). 
Similarly, offsetting will be applied only as a contractual measure on the basis of Article 44 GA 
(— never as a public law measure directly on the basis of Artic le 80(1) of the Financial 
Regulation No 966/2012 ). 
By consequence, dispute settlement is normally  limited to arbitration (see Article 57.2 ). The public 
law remedies ( i.e. Article 263 action) do not apply . 
 
 ARTICLE 53 — INTERPRETATION OF THE AGREEMENT  
53.1 Precedence of the Terms and Conditions over the Annexes  
The provisions in the Terms and Conditions of the Agreement take precedence over its An nexes.  
Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1. 
53.2 Privileges and immunities  
[OPTION 1 for all international organisations:  Nothing in the Agreement may be interpreted as a waiver 
of any privileges or immunities accorded to the [ insert name of international organisation(s) ] by its 
constituent documents or international law. ] 
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ]

ARTICLE 54 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS, DATES AND DEADLINES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Periods in days  
A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at midnight of 
the last day of the period. Days are calendar days . 
Example:  Under Article 20.3, the coordinator must submit a periodic repor t within 60 days following the end of 
each reporting period.  
The action is divided into the following reporting periods:  
 RP1: from 1 March 2015 to 31 August 2016  
 RP2: from 1 September 2016 to 28 February 2017  
Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2016 and ends on 30 
October 2016.  
The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2017 and ends on 29 of April 
2017.  
 
2. Periods in months or years  
Periods expressed in months or  years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the day 
on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period.  
Example: Under Article 47 , the Commission/ Agency  may suspend the payment deadline if a request for 
payment cannot be approved. The suspension takes effect on the day the Commission/Agency sends the 
notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the Commission/ Agency  if it will 
continue.  The Commission sent the notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2016. Therefore, the 
suspension will have exceeded two months on 30 September 2016.  
If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April) , the period ends at midnight of th e last day of that 
month (e.g. 30 of April).  
Example: Under Article 22.1.2 , reviews may be started up to two years after the balance is paid.  A grant’s 
balance is paid on 29 February 2016. Therefore, the two -year period sta rts on 1 March 2016 and ends on 1 
March  2018.  ARTICLE 54 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS, DATES AND DEADLINES  
In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7156, periods expressed in days, months or years  are calculated 
from the moment the triggering event occurs.  
The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period.

1. Amendments  
When & What?  An amendment is necessary whenever there is a need to change  the GA (i.e. the 
core agreement and/or  the Annexes ).  ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT  
55.1 Conditions  
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call 
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.  
55.2 Procedure  
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for  amendment signed in the electronic exchange 
system (see  Article 52 ). 
The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3).  
If a change of coordinator is requested without its  agreement, the submission must be done by another 
beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).  
The request for amendment must include:  
- the reasons why;  
- the appropriate supporting documents, and  
- for a change of coordinator without its agreeme nt: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this 
opinion has been requested in writing).  
The [Commission] [Agency]  may request additional information.  
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the electronic exchange system 
within 45 days of receiving notification (or any additional information the [Commission] [Agency]  has 
requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The 
deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within 
the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected.  
An amendment enters into fo rce on the day of the signature of the receiving party.  
An amendment takes effect  on the date agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, on the 
date on which the amendment enters into force.

Characteristics of amendments : 
 Can only be done in writing  — an oral agreement is not binding on the parties . 
 Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the Commission/Agency through 
an exchange of letters . 
 Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no date 
specified, on the date of the second party approves (not retroactive) . 
 Can only be implement ed after the entry into force of the GA and before the final payment 
is made.  
 Must normally be requested  before the end of the project; in exceptional cases amendment 
clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of coordinator or change of 
coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make the final payment) . 
  The cases where an ame ndment is necessary are called ‘a mendment types’ (AT); the amendment 
clauses are called ‘AT clauses’ . 
  The general terms and conditions of the GA can NOT be changed  via an amendment. O nly GA-specific 
data (e.g. duration of the reporting periods, start ing date, etc.) and the options in the GA can be added , 
removed or updated via an amendment.  
Examples:   
1. If the JRC should have been a beneficiary but then does not accede to the GA, the options related to 
the JRC will be removed.  
2. If the JRC is added as a beneficiary during the action, the GA options related to the  JRC will be 
added to the GA.  
3. If a linked third party ends its participation, the option in Article 14.1 will be updated to set its ‘end 
date of participation ’. 
  Amendments may NOT result in changes that — if known before awarding the grant — would have 
had an impact  on the award decision. Those are mostly changes  that:  
 involve the consortium composition and have an impact  on the eligibility  criteria set out in  
General Annexes A and C to the  Main Work Programme  (e.g. consortium of three entities 
established in three differe nt Mem ber States (BG, PL and FR) and replacement of the PL 
beneficiary by a BG beneficiary while the call required the representation in the consortium of at 
least three Member States)  
 involve  changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award cr iteria announced in the 
work programme/ call (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so substantially that the action no 
longer corresponds to the scope of the call)  
 breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants  
 do not comply with the rules applicable to the GA (i.e. Financial Regulation  No 966/2012 , Rules 
for Participation  Regulation No 1290/2013 , etc.) or with provisions of the GA itself (e.g. 
amendment to subcontract tasks of the coordinator).  
 Information obligation  — Changes  in the name, address, legal form  and organisation type  
AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation  may or may 
not require an amendment (see below)  — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under Article 
17.2.  
If such changes affect the implementation of the action and require an amendment, the 
Commission/Agency will examine the situation and inform the coordinator.  
Examples (change that requires an amendment):   
1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necess ary terminate its participation and to amend the GA .  
2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during  the action . The change of address implies that the 
beneficiary becomes not eligible for EU funding, so the GA will have to be amended to make it a ‘beneficiary 
not receiving EU funding’ .  
3. Beneficiary C participates in an innovation action (IA) and loses its non -profit status during grant 
implementation. It will be necessary to amend the GA to change the reimbursement rate.  
Examples (change that do es NOT require an amendment):   
1. Beneficiary D changes its name. The update in the Participant  Register is sufficient; no amendment is 
needed.  
2. Beneficiary E participates in an SME instrument action and loses its SME -status during grant 
implementation. No amendment is needed because there is an explicit exception in Article 53(2) of the 
Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 .  

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  356  Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity as those 
who signed the initial GA.  
 Leaves all the other provisions of the GA which are not af fected unchanged and to continue 
to have full effect.  
 Forms an integral part of the GA.  
 Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the GA (applicable law and EU law), with the 
other provisions of the GA and with the applicable model grant agreement.  
 Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the GA which might call into 
question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal treatment of beneficiaries or 
applicants.  
Normally amendments are done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be proposed 
by the Commission/Agency (e.g. where errors need to be corrected ; to change  Annex 1 after a 
review of the action , etc.). 
 
Sample  list of cases where an amendment is necessary:  
 Removal of a beneficiary whose participation was terminated  due to non-accession  
to the GA or non-provision of the requested declaration on joint and several liability  
(AT1; see Article 50.2  and 50.3) 
What?  Removal of a beneficiary that never became part of the GA.  
How?  The amendment is normally  triggered by the beneficiaries.  
In case of beneficiary  termination  (by the consortium ), the notification of termination and 
amendment must be combined.   
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment has to propose a new coordinator  (AT8) . 
The changes will be made ex tunc (i.e. since the beginning) since the beneficiary never 
participated in the grant.  
If the beneficiary was participating with linked third parties /international partners , they will 
automatically be  removed.  
GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties /international partners ) are 
automatically removed/changed/become not applicable (e.g. linked third party options, non-
EU beneficiary, JRC, IO , beneficiar y receiving/ not receiving EU funding ). 
Annexes 1 and 2  will have to be changed  (AT21 and AT31) .  
 Removal of a beneficiary whose participation was terminated for other reasons 
(AT2; see Article 50.2  and 50.3) 
What?  Removal of a beneficiary during the action.  
What not?  There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the 
end of the action (see Article 3 ) — unless the  beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND 
the amendment is necessary to comply with the obligation to submit the reports and 
distribute the payments.  
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
In case of beneficiary  termination (by the consortium ), the notification of termination and 
amendment must be combined.  
If the coordinator is removed, the amendment has to propose a new coordinator  (AT8) .  
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — If the consortium terminates 
the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to change 
the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request the 
amendment  (see Article 50.2  and below point 2) .  
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — If the coordinator 
must be changed but can no longer submit the request for amendment , the same 
procedure as for coordinator change without its agreement shou ld be used.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  357 Changes will be made ex nunc (because the beneficiary participated in the grant up until 
termination and , moreover, many obligations are applicable after termination).  
The termination date will be added to the Preamble and the beneficiary wil l be entitled to 
submit costs until that date.  
If the beneficiary was participating with linked third parties /international partners , they will 
also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) and the end date of participation 
will be added to Article 14 /Article 14a  (AT5a/5b). 
By contrast, the GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties /international 
partners ) will NOT be removed/changed/ become not applicable  (e.g. linked third party 
options, non-EU beneficiary, JRC, IO , beneficiar y receiving/not receiving EU funding) . 
Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed  (AT21 and AT 31).  
 Adding a new beneficiary (AT3; see Article 56.2 ) 
What?  Addition of a new beneficiary during the action.  
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the  Participant Register  — 
unless it already has a validated partic ipant identification code (PIC).   
The accession date will be added to  the Preamble of the GA  and the beneficiary will be 
entitled to submit costs as from that date . 
The date must be selected in the Accession  Form (attached to the amendment request). 
It is possible to cho ose between : 
 the date of signature of the Accession Fo rm 
 the date of entry into force of the amendment  
OR 
 a fixed date:  
 retroactive (before signature of the Accession Form)  
OR 
 future (after signature of the Accession Form — this should be an 
exceptional case with a justification) . 
Handover period — If a new beneficiar y joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the 
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is 
replaced) — so that  both can incur costs for a certain period .  
Example:  The former beneficiary ends its participation on 1.6.2015, and the new beneficiary 
accede s to the GA on 1.5.2015.  
If the new beneficiary is participating with linked third parties /international partners , they 
will also have to be added (with effect from the same date) and the starting date of 
participation will be added to Article 14 /Article 14a  (AT6a/6b). 
The GA options for the beneficiary  (and its linked third parties /international partners ) will be 
added/changed/beco me applicable (e.g. linked third party options, non-EU beneficiary, JRC, 
IO, beneficiary receiving/not receiving EU funding) . 
Annexes 1 and 2  will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31) .  
 Change of beneficiary due to  partial takeover (AT4; called ‘partial  transfer of rights 
and obligations’ in FP7)  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a 
new beneficiary — without passing via termination (see Article 50 ) or addition of a new 
beneficiary  (see Article 56 ). 
This amendment type should, however, NOT be used if the former beneficiary does NOT leave the 
consortium  (but stays on as part of the consortium). In this case, simply use the amendment 
clause for addition of a new beneficiary (AT3).  
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  358 What? Transfer due to partial takeover.  
‘Partial takeover’ means that a part of the business of the beneficiary — including the 
GA — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies) (transfer of a business unit as a 
going concern, e.g. partial acquisition, distribution of a business unit after 
dissolution/liquidation, division/dem erger, etc. ).  
‘Partial acquisition’ means that the original entity continues to exist, but that a 
new entity purcha ses a department, business unit,  or similar (and absorb s or 
takes over part of the rights and obligations of the original entity). Thus, some of 
the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are transferred to 
the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity and only 
some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case -by-case analysis is needed  
(and an amendment therefore necessary).  
Example:  Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all GAs where 
the mobile phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights 
and obligations; other GAs where other divisions of company X work will not be 
affected.  
‘Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation’ means that the original 
entity disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but that (one or more) new 
entities purchase a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over 
part of the rights and obligations of the original entity). Since only some  of the 
beneficiary’s rights and obligations are transferred, a case -by-case analysis is 
needed (and an ame ndment therefore necessary).  
‘Division/demerger’ means that the original entity disappears and several entities 
replace it; different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities 
(i.e. several partial transfers to different entities).  
Examples:   
1. Company X has several ongoing grants. Company X is bought by two other 
companies (Y & Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other 
the remaining divisions. For some GAs there will be a transfer of rights and 
obligation s from X to Y, for other GAs it will be from X to Z.  
2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented 
by its engineering division and some action tasks to be implemented by other 
divisions). Company Ω is bought by two other c ompanies (E and O), one of which 
absorbs the engineering division and the other the rema ining divisions. There are two 
partial takeovers:  one to company E and one to company O.  
What not?  Simple sale of (one or more) assets of the beneficiary is NOT a ‘part ial takeover’; 
it does not involve the transfer of the GA, but — at most  — a transfer of (some) action 
tasks if the beneficiary can no longer fulfil its action tasks. In this latter case, also the sale 
of assets will require an amendment, in order to termi nate participation of the beneficia ry 
and/or add a new beneficiary . 
Example:  Company Ω implementing two different tasks in an action (engineering and testing) 
sells the engineering department to company E with the understanding that E will implement 
the en gineering tasks of Ω in the action. The GA will have to be amended to add company E as 
a new beneficiary; company Ω remains beneficiary in the GA for the other action tasks (e.g. 
testing). (I f company E is already a beneficiary in the GA, the GA must be am ended only to 
modify Annexes 1 and 2 to adjust the action tasks and the budget; it is not be necessary to 
add E as new beneficiary).  
Best practice:  In case of doubt, the beneficiaries should contact the Commission/Agency 
(via the Funding & Tenders Portal  messag ing function ).  
NO amendment is necessary for universal takeovers (see below) . 
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries;  if the Commission/Agency 
agrees, the new entity will replace the original entity as party to the GA (as new 
beneficiary).  
‘New beneficiary’ is used here only for the purpose of the amendment; it can be  either a 
new beneficiary joining the co nsortium or an already existing beneficiary who took over 
a part of the business of another beneficiary.  
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 >  Article 55  359  
 
 
 
If the new beneficiary joins the GA, it must first register (and get validated) in the 
Participant Register  — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).  
If the partial takeover is governed by national law, the amendment request must clearly set 
out the legal situation and the consequences for the GA (both toward s the 
Commission/Agency and towards the other beneficiaries). It must, in particular : 
 explain the financial liability of the former beneficiary  
 cite the applicable rules (with hyperlinks to the texts, if possible) , and 
 provide a copy of the takeover contra ct.  
Best practice:  In order to avoid multiple submission of documents , beneficiar ies are 
recommended to  upload the takeover contract in the Participant Register  (via My 
Organisation page) and specify in the amendment request that the legal documents are 
available in the Funding & Tenders  Portal. This is particularly useful if several EU grant 
agreements or contracts are affected by a partial takeover.  
The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be select ed in the  amendment request. If the new beneficiary joins the 
action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive 
dates are only allowed in exceptional cases a nd with specific justification.  
If the former beneficiary was participating with linked third parties /international partners , 
the new beneficiary will have to determine  which of the former beneficiary’s linked third 
parties /international partners  stay on as linked third parties /international partners  of the 
new beneficiar y (AT6a/6b) — all other linked third pa rties/international partners  will be 
automatically removed . 
The GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties /international partners ) will be 
added/changed/become applicable (e.g. linked third party options, non -EU beneficiary, 
beneficiary r eceiving/not receiving EU funding) . 
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31) . 
The former beneficiary does NOT need to submit any reports to the Commission/Agency. 
The financial  statement  for the open reporting pe riod until transfer must be uploaded with 
the next periodic report either by the former beneficiary (for the time it was a beneficiary) 
or by the new one  together with its own financial statement . 
 Removing a linked third party /international partner  (AT5a/5b; see Article s 14 and 
14a) 
What?  Removal of a linked third party /international partner  during the action.  
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
If requested by the Commission/Agency  (e.g. because of audit results or an OLAF 
investigation) , the consortium MUST  submit an amendment to  remove a linked third 
party /international partner . 
 
 
 
NO termination notification — Linked third parties /international partners  can be removed by 
the consortium by simple amendment; no formal termination notification  is required  
(termination  notification  applies only to beneficiaries; see Article 50.2 )  
Changes will be made ex nunc (because the linke d third party /international partner  
participated in the grant up until removal and , moreover, many obligations are applicable 
after termination).  
The end date of participation will be added to Article 14 /14a.  
The new beneficiary(ies) will (each) be fully jointly and severally  liable with the former 
beneficiary for recoveries under Article 44 . (By contrast: N O joint and several liability for debts 
linked to financial penalties and damages under Articles 45  and Article 46 .) 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 If the consortium does not follow -up this request, the Commission/Agency m ay 
terminate the participation of the beneficiary  (and thereby also remove the linked third 
party/international partner) . 
 
The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
beneficiary — without passing via ‘termination’  (Article 50 ) or ‘addition of a new 
beneficiary’  (Article 56 ). 
 
 
. 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  360 The date must be select ed in the amendment request. It must be either a fixed date or 
‘the day after the submission of the amendment request’. The fixed date must be in the 
future (i.e. after the request: end of participation can NOT be retroactive).  
The GA options fo r the linked third party /international partner  will normally NOT be 
removed/changed/become not applicable . 
Annexes 1 and 2 will have to be changed (AT21 and AT31).  
 Adding a linked third party /international partner  (AT6a/6b; see Article s 14 and 14a) 
What?   Addition of a  new linked third party /international partner  during the action.  
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
The new linked third party /international partner  must first register (and get validated) in the 
Participant Register  — unless it already has a validated participant identificatio n code (PIC).  
The name of the linked third party /international partner  and the s tarting date of 
participation will be added to Article 14 /14a. 
The date must be select ed in the amendment request. It is possible to choose between 
a fixed date or the ‘date of  entry into force of the amendment ’. If the linked third 
party /international partner  joins the action at the same time as the beneficiary, the 
starting date of participation must be the same date as the accession date of the 
beneficiary.  
The GA options for  the linked third party /international partner  will be 
added/changed/become applicable.  
Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31) . 
 Change concerning a beneficiary/linked third party ‘not receiving EU funding ’ 
(AT7a ; see Article 9 ) 
What?  If a beneficiary/linked third party — exceptionally — becomes eligible /not eligible for 
receiving EU funding during the action (e.g. due to a change of establishment or a country 
changing eligibility status)  OR if it suddenly requests funding/zero funding , this change will 
normally require an amendment  (to change Annex 1, Annex 2 and the options in Article s 9 
and 57 ). 
Example s:  
1. Beneficiary  R moves from Europe to Australia and thus is no longer eligible for receiving EU 
funding. The GA must be amended. If R is participating with a linked third party M established in 
France, M will continue being eligible for funding.  
2. The country in which beneficiary X is established leaves the  EU (without an agreement ensuring 
continued eligibility) . The beneficiary is therefore no longer eligible for funding and the GA may 
have to be  amended (or terminated; see Article 50 ). 
3. Beneficiary Y is eligible but signed the grant with zero funding. During the action the 
responsibilities within the consortium are shifted and beneficiary Y takes on a bigger role involving 
more costs. The other consortium members agree to adapt the bud get and renounce to some 
funding in order to allow beneficiary Y to claim funding.   
 
 
How?  This amendment can normally be triggered only by the Commission/Agency.  
 Change of coordinator  (AT8)  
What?  Replacement of the coordinator during the action  (e.g. because of  financial 
difficulties ).  
Exceptionally, a n amendment remains possible and necessary after the end of the action 
(see Article 3 ) — until the payment of the balance is paid out and distributed .  
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — After the end of the 
action, i f the coordinator can continue its participation with the bank account of the 
administrator/liquidator  (i.e. termination  and coordinator change  not really needed), it is 
therefore exceptionally sufficient to change the bank account (AT40) without changing the 
coordinator . 
 Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article 6 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  361 What not?  There is NO need to request an amendment for a  change of the person  in charge 
of the coordination of the project (since the person’s  name is not mentioned in the GA).  
 
 
 
 
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the GA, it must first accede to the GA 
as a new beneficiary  (AT3) .  
The former coordinator may continue to participate in the action as a normal beneficiary or 
may terminate its participation  (AT2) . 
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — If the consortium terminates 
the coordinator without its agreement, it  must provide proof of its decision to change 
the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request the 
amendment  (see Article 50.2  and below point 2) . 
Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — If the coordinator 
must be changed but can no longer submit the amendment request , the same 
procedure as for coordinator change without its agreement should be used.  
The handover  date will be added  to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be  select ed in the amendment request  (fixed date or date of entry into 
force of the amendment) .  
The date the former coordinator stops acting as coordinator  should normally be the date 
the new coordinator takes over the coordination tasks  (handover date) . If there was a 
gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts ; e.g. coordinator is in 
bankrupcy ) there will be two different dates: the one fo r the former coordinator (when it 
stopped doing coordinator tasks — must be at the latest its termination date) and the 
one for the  new coordinator (when it took over the coordinator tasks —  must be after 
its accession date) . 
 Change of the coordinator’s b ank account for payments  (AT40)  
What?  An amendment is necessary for all changes that imply a change to the account 
number/IBAN code.  
Example:  The coordinator changes bank account.  
What not?  NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name of 
the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Funding & 
Tenders  Portal Participant Register  is sufficient.  
How?  The bank account data must first be updated in the Participant  Register (and be 
validated).  
 Change of the starting date, action duration or reporting periods  (AT23, AT24, 
AT25)  
What?  Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting periods).  
Example:  The GA for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the date on which the GA 
enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the consortium cannot start on that date and 
requests the Commission to change it.  
 
 
 
How?  An extension of the action must be requested  before  the action ends  and will only be 
accepted in exceptional cases.  
 Changes to Annex 1  (description of the action)  (AT21)   
What? Changes to the description of the action,  in particular:  
  Even if the action is prolonged, t he maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1 ) will NOT be 
increased.   
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Information obligation — In case of a change of person in charge of coordination , 
the coordinator  must  — in addition to updating the data in the Funding & Tenders Portal  
inform the Commission/Agency under  Article 17.2 ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  362  significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed)  or of their 
division among the beneficiaries  
 changes concerning in -kind contributions provided by third p arties (against payment 
or free of charge) or subcontracts  
Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure (see 
Articles 11 , 12 and 13); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment, it will 
immediately know if the Commission/Agency agree s (or not) . Without amendment , 
this decision is left for later and the Commission/Agency may reject the costs  as 
ineligible later on (at the moment of the payment) . 
 changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by linked third parties and related 
costs (including if a linked third party  is removed)  
 significant changes to the plan for exploitation and dissemination ( unless Annex 1 
already foresees an update to be submitted with the periodic report )  
 changes concerning GA option s (options are removed or added, e.g. adding the 
options to pro vide trans -national access to research infrastructure requires normally 
a modification of Annex 1 and/or Annex 2)  
 significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. changes of ethics requirements to 
align to  ethical principles and legislation ; adding/removing  deliverables ; changes in 
substance of a project  output which is  reflected in a deliverable , etc.). 
What not?  Changes to the due date of a deliverable  normally do not require an amendment 
(except for  certain  deliverables , where timeliness is  key)  
 
 Changes to Annex 2 and Annex 2a (estimated budget)  or specific unit costs (AT31 
and AT36)  
What? Changes to the estimated budget,  in particular:  
 a budget transfer of amounts between beneficiaries or between budget categories 
(or both) which are linked to a  significant change in the  action’s work (i.e. Annex 1)  
 a budget transfer to a form of costs that is not used by the bene ficiary (i.e. with 0 
EUR costs in Annex 2)  — except for transfer of amounts within the budget category 
A ‘personnel costs’  and for transfers to the budget category 'costs of internally 
invoiced goods and services' . 
Example:  
During the action implementation, the beneficiary decides to use the access costs for 
transnational access to research infrastructure unit cost. This requires a n amendment to 
fix the unit cost and to move  budget  to budget category F.2 .  
What not?  There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the budget 
transfers rule in Article 4.2  (e.g. budget transfers within the personnel cost ; see also 
below ). 
How?  The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries.  
Best practice:  If Annex 2a or specific unit costs need  to be changed, the beneficiaries should 
contact the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal  messag ing function ).  
Sample  list of cases where NO amendment is needed:  
 Budget transfers not listed above  
Transfers of amounts between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both) do NOT 
require an amendment , provided that the action is implemented in line with Annex 1 (see 
Article 4.2 ). 
Budget transfers within the  personnel cost category and budget transfers to costs of 
internally  invoiced goods and services are possible without having to amend the GA . 
Examples:  
1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual 
costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual 
accounting practices (average personnel costs).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  363 2. An SME joins an on -going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its 
costs as act ual personnel costs (category A.1). He realises the mistake and then switches to the 
unit costs for SME owners (category A.4) .  
 Change of name , address  or other legal entity data  (of beneficiar ies/linked third 
parties) 
Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.) , official registration number, address, 
VAT number do NOT require an amendmen t; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR 
(and validation) in the Participant Register  is normally sufficient.  
Linked third parties /international partners  — Since they normally do not have  direct 
access to the Participant  Register, linked third parties /international partners  must 
inform their beneficiary who must inform  the Commission/Agency . The data will then be 
updated by the Commission/Agency (and validated ). 
If (exceptionally ) the Commission/Agency considers that the registered change affects 
the implementation of the action, it will inform the coordinator  (and instruct it to 
request an amendment or trigger itself an amendment, if  needed ).  
Example:  Company R moves from Europe to Australia  and this implies that the beneficiary is 
no longer eligible for EU funding . In such a case, the Commission will make an amend ment to 
the GA to change the beneficiary  status into ‘beneficiary not receiving EU funding’ . 
Short names have no legal  value and only serve as easy identifiers in the GA.  If needed, 
they can be changed  in the context of an amendment initiated on other grounds.  
A change of the person that represent the coordinator  for the purposes of signing the GA 
requires NO follow -up at all (not even a change in the Participant  Register  — since this  
name is only relevant at the moment of GA signature (not afterwards).  
 Change of beneficiary due to  universal takeover (called ‘u niversal transfer of rights 
and obligations’ in FP7).  
Trans fers of the GA linked  to a universal takeover (i.e. where the original entity is replaced 
by one new entity and all the rights and obligations — including the GA  — are transferred to 
this new entity, e.g. merger or full acquisition ) do NOT require an amendment; an update of 
the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and validation) in the Participant Register  is normally 
sufficient.   
Example:  Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by:  
 becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases 
to exist)  or  
 establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’).  
If — exceptionally — the Commission/Agency considers that the registered transfer  affects 
the action implementation, it will inform the coordinator  (and instruct it to request an 
amendment, if needed) . 
Example:   
The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former beneficiary 
or linked third party and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.  
Case 1:  The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this 
involves a change of the bank account number in Article 21.8 , each GA in which it participates as 
coordinator must be amended to update  this information  (AT40) . 
Case 2:  A non -profit legal entity X is acquired by a big for -profit company Y; as a result of the 
acquisition Y assumes the rights an d obligations of X in on -going i nnovation actions (IAs) . The 
reimbursement rate applicable to Y i n those on -going GAs will differ from that of X since the new 
beneficiary will not be entitled to a reimbursement rate of 100% (but only to a reimbursement rate 
of 70% ). The GA must be amended to change the reimbursement rate (AT33) and the estimated 
budget (AT31) . 
For on -going RIA grants there will be no need to modify Annex 2 since the reimbursement rate is 
the same for all beneficiaries (100%).

2. Procedure  
How?  Amendment requests must be prepared  by the requesting party (i.e. the coordinator or 
the Commission/Agency) directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
Best practice:  If none of the available amendment clauses fit, beneficiaries should contact the 
Commission/Agency (via the Funding &  Tenders  Portal  messaging function ), to discuss the 
amendment.  
 
 
The request  must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time  (i.e. sufficiently in 
advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before they are due to take effect and — 
generally — before the end of the action ; see Article 3 ). Requests introduced AFTER the end of 
the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific (duly substantiated) cases (e.g. 
change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the payment of the balance) . 
The coordinator must ensure that it has the agreement of the consortium (in  accordance with 
the internal decision -making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc. set 
out in the consortium agreement ). 
Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be  submitted 
and signed  by the PLSIGN  of the coordinator (on behalf of the other beneficiaries;  see Annex 3 ). 
Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — For change of coordinator 
without its agreement a special procedure applies : The other beneficiaries must nominate one 
of them to act on their behalf to notify termination and request the amendment. The nominated 
beneficiary must name a contact person responsible  for the amendment.   
Before it has been accepted or rejected, an amen dment request  may at any moment be 
withdrawn .  
 For more guidance on amendments, see the  Guide on a mendment types & supporting documents  and the 
Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual .   
  Before the amendment request, n ew beneficiaries , new linked third parties or other new beneficiary 
data must have been registered and validated in the Participant Register . 
Examples:  
1. A new  beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation ). This means that the new beneficiary will first 
have to register in the Participant  Register, be validated, appoint a LEAR, and provide the necessary 
information and supporting documents through the Funding & Tenders  Portal.  
2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.  
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover , the beneficiary  must  — in 
addition to updating the data in the Participant  Register — inform the coordinator (offline) under  
Article 17.2 , if the universal takeover could:  
 significantly affect or delay the implementation of t he action or the EU financial interests or  
 affect the decision to award the grant or the compliance with requirements under the GA.  
The coordinator must then inform the Commission/Agency (via the  Funding & Tenders Portal ) 
and, if necessary, request an amendment.  
The same appl ies if the universal takeover concerns a linked third party .  
  The amendment request must i nclude the necessary information and supporting documents . A signed 
and submitted amendment request can NOT be changed — only accepted, rejected or withdrawn. It is 
however possible to provid e clarifications or additional information/documents.  
 For more guidance on amendments, see the Guide on a mendment types & supporting documents  and 
the Portal Online Manual .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  General MGA  
H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  365 In order to change the amendment request, it must be withdrawn and re -submitted (changes 
to submitted requests are NOT possible).  
Example:  The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the reallocation 
of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is urgent because the 
Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes may require more time, the 
coordinator withdraws the  request and makes a new request to change only the bank account and a second 
one to change the Annexes.  
A request containing several changes to the GA will be considered as one (and must either be 
agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).  
If the  receiving party requests additional information/documents , a new deadline will 
apply, i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents.  
Example:  The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several linked third parties ( see 
Article 14 ). The Commission requests a signed declaration for the joint and several liability of the linked 
third parties (Annex 3a) . A new 45 -day deadline for evaluation and validation will apply from the moment 
the Commission receives the declaration.  
The other party must — within 45 days  — agree or disagree .  
The deadline  may exceptionally be extended  by the receiving party — for a period to be 
determined case -by-case —, if necessary for the assessment of the reques t (e.g. a review is 
needed to assess the changes) . 
If accepted  it will be counter -signed by the receiving party directly in the Funding & Tenders 
Portal  (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator).  
If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected  
(
 new in Horizon 2020 : contrary to FP7, there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new 
amen dment reques t may however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial 
request.  
The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has 
agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Funding & Tenders Portal ).  
The amendment  will take effect  (i.e. the changes to the GA will start to apply) either:  
 on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or  
 on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment . 
The date  should normally be after the entry into force  of the amendment .  
In justified cases it may — exceptionally — be before  (retroactivity of the amendment). 
(In some  cases, the GA itself  provides for retroactivity.)  
Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA):  
1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the GA  (AT3) , it must assume the rights and obligations 
from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry into force 
of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as from the 
accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment).  
2. Following a suspension of the implementation of the a ction by the beneficiary or by the 
Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date  set out in the 
amendment  (AT26) . This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force 
(see Article 49.2.2 ). 
3. If the amendment intends to correct an error  (AT60) , the change will be made with effect from 
entry into force of the GA (i.e. from the beginning).  
Depending on the amendment type , the date of taking effect may have an impact on the 
eligibility of costs.  
An amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates.

H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55  366 On 1 May 2016, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account and to add a new

the Accession Form (1 April 2016), while the change of bank account takes effect on a date agreed by 
the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into force (i.e. 10 June 2016, the d ay it is 
signed by the receiving party).

ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Acce ssion  to the GA  (beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble ) 
All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the GA by signing  the Accession Form  
(see Annex 3)  directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal . They must do this within 30 days after 
the GA enters into force (see Article 58 ). 
Only the beneficiar ies’ legal s ignatories  (PLSIGNs) may sign the Accession Forms.  
Declarations on joint and several liability  (see Annex 3a)  must be signed by the linked third 
party on paper  and send it to its beneficiary. The beneficiary must scan it and upload it in PDF 
format, before signing the Accession Form.   
Without the declaration, it will NOT be able to accede to the GA (and thus NOT be 
considered a party to the GA).  
 
 
Linked t hird parties do not become parties to the GA and therefore do NOT  need to sign an 
Accession Form.  
The coordinator is not obliged to distribute hard copies  of the GA  and Accession Form to the 
other beneficiaries  (
 new in Horizon 2020 ). All documents are available in the Funding & Tenders  
Portal  project file . 
 
Specific case s (accession) : 
JRC — If the JRC is beneficiary, it must sign Annex 3b as its Accession Form (instead of Annex 3).  MULTI -BENEFICIARY ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
56.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble  
The other beneficiaries must accede to the Agreement by signing the Accession Form  (see Annex 3) in the 
electronic exchange system (see  Article 52 ) within 30 days after its entry into force (see  Article 58 ) 
[OPTION  if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested: and for beneficiaries for 
which the [Commission][Agency] has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party, by also 
submitting  — at accession — a declaration  on joint and several liability  (see Annex 3a) signed by the third 
party. ] 
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into 
force (see Article 58 ). 
If a beneficiary does not accede to the Agreement within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within 
30 days — request an amendment to make any changes necessary to ensure proper implementation of the 
action. This does not affect the [Commission’s] [Agency’s] right to terminate the Agreement (see  Article 50 ). 
 
 Record -keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original  of the linked third party in its files  (see 
Article 18.1.2 ).

1. Addition of new beneficiaries  (amendment)  
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary.  
The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the work programme/ call, have 
sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the 
non-exclusion criteria and commit to implement the action under the same terms and 
conditions as the other beneficiaries . 
Article 56 does not apply to mono -beneficiary actions.  Mono -beneficiary actions can therefore 
NOT become multi -beneficiary actions.  
How?  The new beneficiary must:  
 register in the Participant Register  and be validated — unless it already has a validated 
participant identification code (PIC)  
 sign the Accession F orm (directly  in Funding & Tenders Portal ) 
 provide a declaration on joint and sev eral liability of its linked third party (if required by the 
Commission/Agency).  
The coordinator must request an amendment  for adding a new beneficiary ( see Article 55 ). 
The Accession Form (attached to the amendment request) must specify the accession date . It 
must be either :  
 the date of signature of the Accession Form  
 the date of entry into force of the Amendment  
OR 
 a fixed date: 
 either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the Accession Form)  
OR 
 future (i.e. after signature of the Accession Form — this should be an 
exceptional case with a justification) . 
Handover period — If a new beneficiar y joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the 
accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) — 
so that  both can incur costs for a certain period .   MONO -BENEFICIARY:  ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
Not applicable  56.2 Addition of new beneficiaries  
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.  
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with  Article 55. It must 
include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in th e electronic exchange system 
(see Article 52 ). 
New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).

1. Applicable law  
As a general rule, H2020 GAs are subject to EU law (supplemented — where necessary — by 
Belgian law), for questions on their interpretation, application and validity.  
 
Specific cases (applicable law):  
International organisations (IOs) — If requested by the international organisation,  the GA may 
provide for derogations:   
 
Situation  Applicable law  
For international organisations 
that do  NOT  accept any 
applicable law clause  No reference to any applicable law71.  
The applicable law will be determined by the Permanent Court of Arbitration 
(see also point 2) . 
According to the Permanent Court of Arbitration  Optional Rules for Arbitration 
Involving International Organisations and States, the applicable law are:  
 the rules of the organisation concerned  
 the law applicable to any agreement or relationship between the  parties 
and 
 where appropriate, the general principles governing the law of 
                                            
71  See Article 180(1) of the Rules of Application  Regulation No 1268/2012 . ARTICLE 57 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES  
57.1 Applicable law  
The Agreement is governed by the applicable EU law, supplemented  if necessary by the law of Belgium  
[additional OPTION for international organisations that do not accept any applicable law clause: As an 
exception, there is no applicable law for [ insert  name(s) of the international organisations concerned ].] 
[additional OPTION for international organisati ons that would accept an applicable law clause but not  
the standard clause (EU + Belgian law): As an exception, the Agreement is governed by a different 
applicable law for the following beneficiaries:  
- [insert name(s) of the international organisations con cerned ]: [by the applicable EU law] [, 
supplemented  if necessary] [by the law of [Belgium][ insert name of another Member State or EFTA

For international organisations 
that  would accept  an applicable 
law clause, but not the standard 
clause  (EU + Belgian law )  The international organisation can choose any  of the following  combination s of 
applicable laws:  
 only EU law  
 only Belgian law  
 only other MS or EFTA country law  
 only general principles governing law of IOs + rules of general

 EU law + Belgian law + general principles governing law of IOs + rules 
of general international law  
 EU law + other MS  or EFTA country law + general principles

 Belgian law + general principles governing law of IOs + rules of 
general international law  
 other MS or EFTA country law + general principles governing law of 
IOs + rules of general international law  
 
 
 new in Horizon 2020 : This is new compared to FP7, where (instead of a horizontal approach for all 
international organisations which cannot accept EU law) it was necessary to make specific provisions 
(special clause 3), in order to accommodate, for example, the participation of  specialised agencies and 
international organisations of the UN  family . It makes it easier for international organisations to 
participate in Horizon 2020.

1. Dispute settlement  
As a general rule, H2020 GAs contain an Article 272 TFEU  arbitration clause — referring 
contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the GA ) to the 
European C ourt of Justice .  
An Article 272 action is ONLY possible once the Commission/Agency position is final (i.e. 
against confirmation letters, debit notes , etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters , pre-
information letters, etc.).  
For Commission grants, actions must be brought against the Commis sion; for Agency grants, 
they must be brought against the Agency  (information is available both in the Preamble of 
your GA and in SyGMa) . 
For dispute s of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions , offsetting  or 
enforceable decision s under Article 299 TFEU ; see Articles 44 , 45 and 46), actions must be 
brought before the European Court of Justice  under Article 263 TFEU  (NOT before any other c ourt 
and NOT under Article 272 ).  57.2 Dispute settlement  
If a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or validity of the Agreement cannot be settled 
amicably, the General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice of the European Union — has sole 
jurisdiction. Such actions must be brought under Artic le 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU 
(TFEU).  
[additional OPTION for non -EU beneficiaries (except beneficiaries established in an associated country 
with an association agreement to Horizon 2020 that stipulates sole jurisdiction of the European  Court of 
Justice) : As an exception, i f such a dispute is between the [Commission] [Agency]  and [ insert non -EU 
beneficiary(ies) name(s) ], the competent Belgian courts have sole jurisdiction. ] 
 [additional OPTION for international organisations and for beneficiaries not eligible for  EU funding, 
which according to their national law cannot be subject to the jurisdiction of the Belgian courts:  As an 
exception, f or the following beneficiaries:  
- [insert name of international organisation or beneficiary not eligible for EU funding ] 
- [insert name of international organisation or beneficiary not eligible for  EU funding ] 
[same for other beneficiaries that are international organisations or non -EU beneficiaries not eligible 
for  EU funding ] 
such disputes must  — if they  cannot be settled amicably — be referred to arbitration.  The Permanent Court 
of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitration Involving International Organisations and States in force at 
the date of entry into force of the Agreement will apply. Th e appointing authority will be the Secretary -
General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration following a written request submitted by either party. The 
arbitration proceedings must take place in Brussels  and the language used in the arbitral proceedings will  
be English. The arbitral award will be binding on all parties and will not be subject to appeal. ] 
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU 
(see Articles 44, 45 and 46), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, 
the Court of Justice of the European Union — under Article 263 TFEU. [OPTION for Agency grants: 
Actions against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the Commission (not aga inst 
the Agency).]

H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 57.2  372  
 
 
 
 
 
Specific cases (dispute settlement):  
Non-EU beneficiaries  — For non -EU beneficiaries, contractual disputes  are normally referred to the 
courts of Brussels, Belgium. They can NOT choose another forum.  (So far NONE  of the H2020 
association agreements provide s for the sole jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. ) 
Disputes of public law nature remain before the European Court of Justice.  
Beneficiaries  not receiving EU funding — Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding which are not 
eligible  (meaning from a third country not eligible for funding;  see Article 9 ) are treated like non -EU 
beneficiaries (i.e. courts of Brussels), unless  their national law explicitly provides that they cannot be 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Belgian courts. In this latter case (very exceptional), contractual 
disputes are referred  to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . 
Disputes of public law nature remain before the European Court of Justice.  
International organisations  — For international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to 
the Permanent Court of Arbitration  (in line , for instance,  with the ir PAGODA agreement, e.g. for the 
United Nations, the  Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement (FAFA) with the United 
Nations72). 
Disputes of public law will normally not  arise, since international organisations are normally  accorded 
immunity from public law decisions  (under their constituent documents or international law) . Such 
international organisations can therefore be subject only to contractual measures and to contractual 
dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration).  
For this reason, the Commission/Agency will normally NOT adopt enforceable decisions under Article 
299 TFEU  (see Article 44 ) or decisions on administrative sanctions  (see Article 45 ). 
Similarly, offsetting will always be applied only as a contractual measure on the basis of Article 44 
GA (NOT as a public law measure directly on the basis of Article 80(1) of the Financial Regulation 
No 966/2012 ). 
For international organisations that have NO immunity, disputes of public law remain before the 
European Court of Justice.

  Public law measures  must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice  under Article 263 TFEU  
(including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries or beneficiaries not receiving EU funding) . 
  All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will  always  be informed about  what they can do 
if they disagree ( means of redress  information in the letters ).

II. ERC  MGAs  
II.1 Background information and approach  
The European Research Council (ERC) Model Grant Agreements  are used for ERC actions only.  
The ERC gives : 
 ‘frontier research grants’ , i.e.: 
 ERC Starting Grants (StG)  
 ERC Consolidator Grants (CoG)  
 ERC Advanced Grants (AdG)  
 ERC Synergy Grants (SyG)  
 proof of concept grants (PoC) , i.e.:  
 ERC PoC  
 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot  
 ERC Low Value grants.  
Frontier research actions use the H2020 ERC MGA . For ERC PoC, there are two specific MGAs: the 
standard ERC PoC MGA ( based on actual costs reimbursement ) and the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot 
MGA with a pre -fixed amount of EUR 150  000. A specific MGA also exists for ERC Low Value 
grants. Other ERC actions (coordination and support actions (CSA)) use the H2020  General MGA.  
The E RC MGA s follow  the General MGA for numbering and content, except for:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 All ERC MGAs deviate from the General MGA as follows:  
 ‘Coordinator’ is replaced by ‘principal beneficiary’ (also in the Annexes)  
 [Agency][Commission]  is replaced by ‘Agency ’ 
 References to/options for Euratom are taken out  
 ‘Technical report(s)’ is replaced by ‘scientific report(s)’  
 The table of contents is adapted  
 Cross -references in the footnotes are adapted  
 
The H2020 ERC MGA deviates from the General MGA as follows:  
 Preamble (ERC principal beneficiary and name(s) of the PI(s))  
 Article 5.2 (ERC specific reimbursement rate)  
 Article 7.1 (ERC reference to work under the guidance of the PI)

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC 377 The annotations will concentrate on differences in substance and interpretation that require 
explanation.  
Parts that do not appl y or differ only in presentation (e.g. Articles 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 50.1.1, 
50.1.2., 50.2.2, 50.3.1, 50.3.2., 50.3.3., 15 and 16,  Annexes) will not be shown.  
For the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA, the Articles where the only difference is the removal of 
references to eligibility of costs (e.g. Article 14, 17.1, 22.5, 41.2 – removal of CFS —) or 
rejection of costs (e.g. Articles 14.2, 18.2, 22.6) will not be shown.  
By contrast, provisions that do not deviate from the General MGA, but that require clarification 
or a specific interpretation for ERC actions are added:  
 Article 2 ( ERC MGA actions ; ERC MGA PoC actions ) 
 Article 4.1 ( ERC MGA budget categories ) 
 Article 6 ( ERC MGA eligible and ineligible costs) 
 Article 8 ( ERC MGA rules on third party involvement ) 
Since the ERC MGA and the standard ERC PoC MGA have a similar set -up (i.e. principal 
beneficiary, host institution, principal investigator) and provisions, the annotations of the standard 
ERC PoC MGA will be limited to major differences from the ERC MGA.  
For the  ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA, the annotations will focus mainly on differences arising 
from the cost models (lump sum versus actual costs reimbursement).  
The annotations (for all three  MGAs) are based on the multi -beneficiary version. The differences 
between multi and mono -beneficiary vers ions are marginal.  For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot, there is 
a single MGA for both mono - and multi -beneficiary actions.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC 380 PIs can be of any nationality , if they intend to conduct research in an EU Member State or 
H2020 associated country and are hosted  (and usually engaged ) by a h ost institution that is 
based in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country.  
Due to the key role of the PI, s/he can  NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the 
action. Requests for amendments to  change the PI will be rejected.  
PI time commitme nts — The PI must comply with certain minimum requirements regarding 
working time on the action (fixed in Annex 1 and 2) and working time in an EU Member State 
or H2020 associated country (set out in the work programme/call).  
The Agency must be informed  before any change in employment or location of the PI .  
Should the PI move to another host institution (in an EU Member State or H2020 associated 
country), t he GA can be transferred to the new host institution  (portability ; see Article 56a ). 
If the PI moves to a n institution established in a non-associated  third country, the GA may be 
terminated (see Article 50. 1 H2020 General MGA ).  
In case of breach, the Agency may terminate the GA or take  any of the other Chapter 6 
measures (e.g. grant reduction, recovery of payments already made, etc.; see Articles 42 -44, 
47-50 H2020 General MGA ). 
PIs do not become party to the GA, but they are the key actors in charge of the research  
activities . However, it is the host institution that subscribes to the financial and legal obligations 
under the GA — since it is the beneficiary.  
Examples:  
1. A PI can choose its own research team. This team is th e research team of the PI and thus different from that 
of a network or consortium.  The engagement of the team follows the rules of the beneficiary and its country.  
2. PIs must be supported by their host institution during the entire action duration.  
In order to govern their internal relationship (during the action), PIs and their host institutions 
must sign a supplementary agreement (SA)  (see Article 32 ). The supplementary agreement 
can NOT replace the employment/engag ement contract  and is not sufficient by itself . 
 
Specific cases  (PIs) :  
PI employed /engaged  by a third party — Exceptionally, the PI may be employed /engaged  not by 
the beneficiary but by a third party (from an EU Member State or H2020 associated country ), i.e.:  
 a third party that provides the PI as in -kind contribution or  
 a linked third party  (see Article 8 ).  
This must be specifically justified in the proposal and included in Annex 1.  
In this case, the supplementary agreement (see Article 32 ) must be signed by the PI, the host 
institution AND the third party.  
Retired PI  — The PI may be retired . 
Several PIs — ERC Synergy grants h ave several PIs (but only one principal beneficiary and one of the 
PIs that acts as ‘correspondent PI’). E ach host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement 
with the PI(s) they engage.  
No supplementary agreement  — NO supplementary agreement  is needed  for ERC PoC grants . 
PI entitled to sign the supplementary agreement  — If the PI is entitled to sign the supplementary 
agreement on behalf of the host institution (because of his/her position in the institution), the 
supplementary agreement must be counter -signed by another per son empowered by the institution . 
The principal investigator can  NOT sign his/her own supplemen tary agreement for both parties.  
Grant p ortability  — If the GA is transferred to another host institution ( see Article 56a ) a new 
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution (and forwarded to the Agency). 
The GA cannot be amended before the PI has sent the new supplementary agreement.

1. ERC frontier research actions  
What?  ERC frontier research grants  fund: 
 ground -breaking, high -gain/high -risk research at the frontiers of knowledge  (‘frontier 
research’)  in any field of research (except nuclear energy) , by one (or more)  principal 
investigator (s) and their research team . 
ERC actions are normally mono -beneficiar y actions, but can also be multi -beneficiary.  
ERC actions are funded under Part I  of Horizon  2020, ‘European Research Council’ (e.g. ERC-
2015-STG). 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled [insert title of the action ] — [insert  acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in Annex 1.

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The ERC MGA uses in principle the same budget categories as the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the ERC MGA:  
 direct personnel costs  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded b y a third party against payment  
 costs for SME owners without salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are  natural persons without salary  
 direct costs of subcontracting  
 other direct costs  
 travel costs and  related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs o f large research infrastructure  
 costs of internally invoiced goods and services  
 indirect costs .  
Thus, the ERC MGA does NOT have:   
 personnel costs for providing trans -national ac cess to research infrastructure  
 direct c osts of providing fin ancial support to third parties  
 specific cost categories . 
 
 The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and A nnex 4).  
 
. 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked 
third party)]  and budget category  (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14] ). [OPTION  to be used if Article 9 or 14a 
applies: It also shows the estimated costs of the beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see Article 9)] 
[and][international partners (see  Article 14a )].]

Programme ).  
 
 ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT, FORM OF GRANT, REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND 
FORMS OF COSTS  
[…] 
5.2 Form of grant, reimbursement rates  and forms of costs  
The grant reimburses 100%  of the beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] eligible costs for the action  (see 
Article 6) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’) (see Annex 2) . 
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following forms (‘ forms of costs ’): 
(a) for direct personnel costs :  
- as actually incurred costs (‘ actual costs ’) or  
- on the basis of an amount per unit calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual 
cost accounting practices (‘ unit costs ’).  
Personnel costs for  SME owners  or beneficiaries that are natural persons  not receiving a salary 
(see Article 6.2, Points A.4 and A.5) must be declared on the basis of the amount per unit set out in 
Annex 2a ( unit costs ); 
(b) for direct costs of  subcontracting : as actually incurred costs ( actual costs );  
(c) for direct costs of providing financial support to third parties : not applicable;  
(d) for other direct costs : 
- for costs of internally invoiced goods and services: on the basis of an amount per unit 
calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices ( unit 
costs ); 
- for all other costs: as  actually incurred costs ( actual costs ); 
(e)  for indirect costs : on the basis of a flat -rate applied as set out in Article 6.2, Point E  (‘flat-rate 
costs ’); 
(f) for specific cost category(ies) : not applicable.

ERC > Chapter 3 > Article 5.2  384 2. Cost forms  
For ERC actions, the cost forms  are in principle the same  as in the  General MGA  (see Article  5 
H2020 General MGA ). 
However, t he ERC MGA does not use all the  unit costs and flat-rates  of the General MGA:  
Like the General MGA, it uses the unit cost for personnel costs on the basis of the 
beneficiaries’ usual accounting practices  (average personnel costs) , the unit costs for SME 
owners and beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary , the unit costs for internally 
invoiced  goods and services  and the flat-rate of 25% for indirect costs.73 
It does NOT use  the unit costs of category F  ‘specific cost categories’ of the General MGA.  
                                            
73  See Article 29(1) and 33(2) of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013  and Commission Decision 
C(2013 ) 8197 of 3 December 2013 authorising the use of reimbursement on the basis of unit costs for the 
personnel costs of the owners of small and medium -sized enterprises and beneficiaries that are natural persons 
not receiving a s alary under the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and under

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions per budget category.  
The ERC MGAs use in principle the same budget categories ( covering  the same types of costs)  
as the General MGA  (see Article  6 H2020 General MGA ) — with the exception of  categories C. 
‘financial support to third parties’ and  F ‘specific cost categories’ . 
The same eligibility  conditions  and calculation rules  apply as in the General MGA (see Article 
6 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, ERC grants have the following  specificities : 
 for category A ‘personnel costs ’: ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
[…] 
6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. direct personnel costs;  
B. direct costs of subcontracting;  
C. not applicable;  
D. other direct costs;  
E. indirect costs;  
F. not applicable.  
‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to 
it directly. The y must not include any indirect costs (see Point E below).  
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed directly to it.  
[…] 
6.5 Ineligible costs  
‘Ineligible costs ’ are:  
[…] 
(b) costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State and 
financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency  for the 
purpose of implementing the EU or Euratom budget); in parti cular, indirect costs if the beneficiary is 
already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the same period, unless it 
can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the action [.][;]

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2  386 Costs for ‘teaching buy -outs’  — If the beneficiaries hire substitutes to perform some of 
the PI’s duties that are not linked to the ERC grant (e.g. teaching) , these costs are NOT 
eligible .  
PI employed/ engaged by a third party  — If the PI is employed/engaged by a third 
party (which thus p ays his/her salary and seconds him/her to work on the premises of the 
beneficiary, for free or against reimbursement, t he salary costs may be declared as direct 
personnel costs ( if for free : under budget category A.1 ‘costs for employees (or 
equivalent)’ ( Article 6.2.A.1); if against payment: under  budget category A. 3 ‘seconded 
persons ’ (Article 6.2.A.3) ).  
 for category D ‘other direct costs ’: 
Recruitment costs  — For ERC frontier research grants, r ecruitment costs , if clearly 
attributable to the action, are eligible as ‘other direct costs ’, even for the unsuccessful 
candidates  (because recruitment is  part of the activities  of such a ctions — unlike for 
actions under the General MGA  or ERC PoC actions ).  
Purchase of scientific publications  — Costs for scientific publications (e.g. books, 
manuscripts, articles, digital copies, etc.) may be eligible, if their direct link to the action 
and their necessity for the action is demonstrated.  
Costs related to protection of the action’s results  — Are e ligible. Given the increasing 
emphasis on the protection of inventions, the PIs are encouraged to protect their 
intellectual property rights properly. Costs related to protection of other intellectual 
property  are NOT eligible.  
Costs related to open access  — Costs for open access to publications (including 
monographs ) and to research data a re eligible if incurred during the action duration. This 
includes costs charged by data repositories or data centres for the storage and 
maintenance of the research data generated by the action. With explicit agreement by the  
Agency, it can also include fees levied for a membership scheme (if this is a requirement 
for publishing with open access or if membership is a pre -condition for significantly lower 
article processing  charges).  
Costs relat ed to scientists’ visits  — Short -term scientists ’ visits  undertaken in the 
frame work of an international  agreement on scientific and technological cooperation ( ERC 
Implementing Arrangement s74) are eligible  even if the scientist is not mentioned as a team 
member. Annex 1 does not need to be amended (i.e. the scientist and research visit do not 
need to be mentioned) .

1. Ineligible costs  
The rules on ineligible costs  are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 6.5 H2020 General 
MGA). 
 
 
 
 
 
 Combin ing H2020 & other EU grants  — ERC grants do NOT prevent PIs from applying 
independently (i.e. in their own name) for furth er EU funding for other actions or for the same action, but 
for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant.  
The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for 100% of 
the costs of the ERC action. Therefore cost items not declared under the ERC grant m ay be covered by 
other EU funding.

Tenders Portal O nline Manual  (links to Regional funding).  6.5 Ineligible costs

parties involved in the action  
For ERC actions, the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the General MGA (see 
Article  8 H2020 General MGA ). 
The PI must in principle, be hosted and engaged by the principal beneficiary . However, in 
exceptional cas es, the PI can be engaged by a third party  (e.g. a third party that makes the PI  
available  to work in the host institution ; see Articles 11 and 12 ). 
Example:  Research agenc ies that put the PIs at disposal of different universities . 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
- use in -kind cont ributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards th e Agency  and the other beneficiaries for 
implementing the action.

ARTICLE  18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
1. Records for personnel costs — Hours worked for the action  
For ERC actions , the same rules on record -keeping apply as in the General MGA (see Article 1 8 
H2020 General MGA ). ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
[…] 
18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support the costs declared  
The beneficiaries must keep th e records and documentation supporting the costs declared, in particular the 
following:  
(a) for actual  costs : adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the costs declared, 
such as contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records. In addition, the beneficiaries’ 
usual cost accounting practices and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation 
between the amounts declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in 
the supporting documentation;  
(b) for unit costs : adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the number of units 
declared. Beneficiaries do not need to identify the actual eligible costs covered or to keep or 
provide supporting documentation (such as accounting statements) to  prove the amount per unit.     
In addition, for  unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices , the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation to prove that the cost 
accounting practices used com ply with the conditions set out in Article 6.2.  
The beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  may submit to the Commission, for approval, a 
certificate (drawn up in accordance with Annex 6) stating that their usual cost accounting practices 
comply with thes e conditions (‘ certificate on the methodology ’). If the certificate is approved, 
costs declared in line with this methodology will not be challenged subsequently, unless the 
beneficiaries have concealed information for the purpose of the approval.  
(c) for flat-rate costs : adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the eligibility of 
the costs to which the flat -rate is applied. The beneficiaries do not need to identify the costs 
covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accountin g statements) to prove the amount 
declared at a flat -rate. 
In addition,  for personnel costs  (declared as actual costs or on the basis of unit costs),  the beneficiaries 
must keep time records  for the number of hours declared. The time records must be in wri ting and 
approved by the persons working on the action and their supervisors, at least monthly. In the absence of 
reliable time records of the hours worked on the action, the Agency may accept alternative evidence 
supporting the number of hours declared, i f it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance.  
As an exception , for persons working exclusively on the action , there is no need to keep time records, if 
the beneficiary signs a declaration  confirming that the persons concerned have worked e xclusively on the 
action.

 ARTICLE 20 — REPORTING — PAYMENT REQUESTS  
20.1 Obligation to submit reports  
The principal beneficiary must submit to the Agency (see Article 52) the scientific and financial reports set 
out in this Article. The financial report includes the requests for payments.  
The reports must be drawn up using the forms and templates provided in the electronic exchange syst em 
(see Article 52).  
20.2  Scientific reporting  — Reporting periods  
The action is divided into the following ‘ scientific reporting periods’ : 
- SRP1: from month 1 to month [ X] 
- [- SRP2: from month [ X+1] to month[ Y] 
- SRP3: from month [ Y+1] to month [ Z] 
- [same for other SRPs ] 
- final SRP: from month [ N+1] to [ the last month of the project ].] 
The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a:  
- ‘periodic scientific report ’ within 60 days after the end of each period (except the last one) and  
- ‘final scientific report ’ within 60 days after the end of the last reporting period.  
The periodic scientific report  must include:  
(a) information about the scientific progress of the work;  
(b) achievements and results of the action, such as publications and a declaration of any major 
chang e of scientific strategy;  
(c) information on whether and how open access has been provided to these results (see Article 29);  
(d) a summary of the achievements of the action for publication by the Agency.  
The final scientific report must:  
(a) present the final results, achievements and conclusions of the action, and how they have been 
disseminated (including via scientific publications) (see Article 29);  
(b) contain a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the Agency.  
20.3  Financial reporting  — Payment requests — Reporting periods  
The action is divided into the following ‘ financial reporting periods ’: 
- FRP1: from month 1 to month [ X] 
- [- FRP2: from month [ X+1] to month[ Y] 
- FRP3: from month [ Y+1] to month [ Z] 
- [same for other FRPs ] 
- final FRP: from month [ N+1] to [ the last month of the project ].] 
The beneficiary must — within 60 days after the end of each period — submit to the Agency a ‘ financial 
report ’ for each reporting period.

ERC > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  391  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The financial report must contain:  
(a) information on the eligible costs, including a ‘ breakdown of direct costs table ’ and a ‘ budget 
follow -up table ’; 
(b) an ‘individual financial statement ’ (see Annex 4) from the beneficiary [and from each linked 
third party]  for the reporting period concerned.  
The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs and flat -rate 
costs; see Article 6) for each budget category (see Annex 2).  
The beneficiary [ and linked third parties ] must declare all eligible costs, even if — for actual costs, 
unit costs and flat -rate costs — they exceed the amounts indicated in the estimated budget (see 
Annex 2). Amounts which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into account 
by the Agency. If an individual financial state ment is not submitted for a reporting period, it may 
be included in the periodic financial report for the next reporting period.  
The final financial statements must also detail the receipts of the action (see Article 5.3.3).  
The beneficiary [and each linke d third party] must certify that: 
- the information provided is full, reliable and true;  
- the costs declared are eligible (see Article 6);  
- the costs can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documentation (see 
Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, 
audits and investigations (see Article 22), and  
- for the last reporting period: that all the receipts have been declared (see Article 5.3.3);  
(a) [OPTION 1 if the JRC is a beneficiary : information  on the amount of each interim payment and 
payment of the balance to be paid by the Agency to the Joint Research Centre ( JRC);][OPTION 2 : 
not applicable; ] 
(d) a ‘summary financial statement ’, created automatically by the electronic exchange system, 
consolidating t he individual financial statements for the reporting period concerned and including 
the request for interim payment (or — for the last financial reporting period — the request for 
payment of the balance ); 
(e) for the last financial reporting period only: a ‘ certificate on the financial statements ’ (see Annex 
5) for the beneficiary [and linked third party] , if it requests a total contribution of EUR 325  000 or 
more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the basis of its usual cost 
accou nting practices (see Article 5.2 and Article 6.2.  
20.4  Currency for financial statements and conversion into  euro  
Financial statements must be drafted in euro.  
Beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  with accounting established in a currency other than the euro must 
convert the costs recorded in their accounts  into euro , at the average of the daily exchange rates published in 
the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union , calculated over the corresponding reporting 
period.  
If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal of the European Union  for the currency in 
question, they must be converted at the average of the monthly accounting rates published on the 
Commission’s website, calculated over the corresponding reporting period.  
Beneficiaries  [and linked third part ies] with accounting established in euro must convert costs incurred in 
another currency into euro according to its usual accounting practices.

1. Reports  
What & When?  For ERC actions, the principal beneficiary must submit both:  
 a periodic scientific report  after the end of each scientific reporting period (except the 
last one), with:  
 information about the scientific progress of the work  
 the achievements and results of the action, such as publications and a declaration 
of any major change of scientific strategy  
 information on whether and how open access has been provided to these results 
(see Article 29 ) 
 a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the Agency.  
 a final scientific rep ort at the end of the action, with:  
 the final results, achievements and conclusions of the action, and how they have 
been disseminated (including via scientific publications) (see Article 29 ) 
 a summary of the achievements o f the action, for publication by the Agency.  
Example:  For a five -year grant, there are two scientific reporting periods, so a ‘periodic scientific report’ is due 
for months 1 -30 and a ‘final scientific report’ for months 31 -60. 
In addition,  the principal beneficiary must submit a financial report  at the end of each financial 
reporting period, with:  
 a narrative containing information on t he eligible costs, including a breakdown of direct 
costs table and a budget follow -up table  
 an individual financial statement  
 a summary financial statemen t, created automatically by the IT system (on the basis of all 
financial statements submitted by the beneficiaries and linked third parties for the 
reporting period), which counts as the request of payment  
 for the last fina ncial reporting period only: a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) . 
Example:  For a five -year grant, there are four financial reporting periods, so a financial report is due for month s 
1-18, 19 -36, 37 -54 and 55 -60. 20.5  Language of reports  
All reports (scientific and financial reports, including financial statements) must be submitted in the 
language of the Agreement.  
20.6  Consequences of non -compliance  
If the reports submitted do not comply with this Ar ticle, the Agency may suspend the payment deadline (see 
Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
If the principal beneficiary breaches its obligation to submit the reports and if it fails to comply with this 
obligation within  30 days following a written reminder, the Agency may terminate the Agreement (see 
Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

2. Reporting periods  
Like for the General MGA, ERC actions are divided into reporting periods.   
The ERC MGA has, however, different reporting periods for financial and scientific reports.  
Their length is defined in the signed GA.  Normally, the financial reporting perio d is 18 months , 
whereas scientific reports are due halfway through  and at the end of the project.  
Example:  For a five -year grant, there are four financial reporting periods (months 1 -18, 19 -36, 37 -54 and 55 -
60) and two scientific reporting periods (months 1-30 and 31 -60). 
Reports must be submitted within 60 days after each period ends.

1. Third parties with rights on results  
For ERC actions , the same rules on third party rights apply as in the General MGA (see Article 26 
H2020 General MGA ). 
Due to the key role of the PI, it is however particularly important that agreements between the 
host institution and the PI allow the host institution to comply with its obligations under the GA  — 
either by foreseeing a transfer of ownership to the host institution or by providing it with  
appropriate access rights (with a right to sub -license).   
 ARTICLE 26 — OWNERSHIP OF RESULTS  
[…] 
26.3 Rights of third parties  (including personnel and the principal investigator[s])  
If third parties (including personnel and the principal investigator [s]) may claim rights to the results, the 
beneficiary concerned must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Agreem ent. 
If a third party generates results for a beneficiary, the beneficiary concerned must obtain all necessary 
rights (transfer, licences or other) from the third party, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if 
those results were generated by t he beneficiary itself.  
If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using the third party to generate the 
results.

29.2 Open access to scientific publications  
Each beneficiary must ensure open access (free of charge, online access for any user) to all peer -reviewed 
scientific publications relating to its results.  
In particular, it must:  
(a) as soon as possible and at the latest on publication, deposit a machine -readable electronic copy of 
the published version or final peer -reviewed manuscript accepted for publication in a repository for 
scientific publications.  
Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data needed to validate 
the results presented in the deposited scientific publications.  
(b) ensure open access to the deposited publication — via the repository — at the latest:  
(i) on publication, if an electronic version is available for free via the publisher, or  
(ii) within six months of pub lication (twelve months for publications in the social sciences and 
humanities) in any other case.  
(c) ensure open access — via the repository — to the bibliographic metadata that identify the deposited 
publication, which must include a persistent identifier.  
29.3 Open access to research data  
[OPTION 1 for actions participating in the Open Research Data Pilot (in line with the provisions in the  
ERC work programme) : Regarding the digital research data generated in the action ( ‘data’), the 
beneficiaries must:  
(a) deposit in a research data repository and take measures to make it possible for third parties to 
access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate — free of charge for any user — the following:  
(i) the data, including associated metadata, needed to validate the  results presented in 
scientific publications as soon as possible;  
(ii) other data, including associated metadata, as specified in the data management plan ; 
(b) provide information — via the repository — about tools and instruments at the disposal of the 
beneficiar ies and necessary for validating the results (and  — where possible — provide the tools 
and instruments themselves).  
This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
36, the security obligatio ns in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all of 
which still apply.  
As an exception, the beneficiaries do not have to ensure open access to specific parts of their research data 
if the achievement of one of the action objectives, as described in Annex 1, would be jeopardised by making 
those specific parts of the research data openly accessible. In this case, the data management plan must 
contain the reasons for not giving access. ]

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Article 29.2  396 
 
1. Open access to scientific publications  
For ERC actions, the rules for open access to scientific publications are in principle the same as in 
the General MGA (see Article 29 H2020 General MGA ). 
Beneficiaries must ensure open, free -of-charge access  to the end -user to peer-reviewed 
scientific publications  relating to their results.  
‘Peer-reviewed publications’ means publications that have been evaluated by other scholars .  
Monographs, book chapters  and other long -text publications are considered to be peer -
reviewed, if the following conditions are fulfilled:  
 at least one independent expert (i.e. external to the publishing house) has reviewed the 
manuscript before acceptance for publication. For mono graphs in the strict sense (i.e. 
not edited collections ), external review of a substantial part of the work is sufficient to 
be considered peer -reviewed  
 the external reviewer must not be a scientific series editor or a commercial editor 
related to the publ ication in question. For edited collection s, it must not be the editor of 
the collection  
 PhD theses and habilitations for profess orial degrees  are considered peer -reviewed if 
they are formally published (because  the review by external experts is generally part of 
the assessment of the candidate's research work for the PhD degree or the 'venia 
legendi' ). 
 
 
 
 
 
ERC grants have however the following  specificities : 
The ERC Scientific Council recommends the use of subject -specific repositories:  
 for publications in the Life Sciences domain: Europe PubMed Central 
(http://europepmc.org ) 
 for publications in the Physical Sciences and Engineering domain: arXiv 
(http://arxiv.org ).  
If there is no appropriate discipline specific repository, researchers should make their 
publications available in institutional repositories or in centralized ones, such as Zenodo 
(http://zenodo.org ). For monographs, book chapters and other long -text publications, the 
recommended repository is the OAPEN Library ( http://oapen.org ). 
With explicit agreement by the  Agency, the extended deadline for publications for grants in the 
social sciences and humanities domain (i.e. 12 months) can exceptionally be granted also for 
specific publications of grants in other domains, if the specific publication can be considered to  
relate to the social sciences and humanities. This must be requested within the 6 months originally 
foreseen.   
Moreover , for publications after the end of the action, if beneficiaries cannot provide open access 
within the time limits set by Article 29.2 w ithout incurring additional costs for gold open access, 
 Other types of publications,  such as non -peer-reviewed articles as wel l as non -peer reviewed 
monographs, books, conference proceedings and 'grey literature' (i.e. informally published material not 
having gone through a standard publishing process,  e.g. reports ), are not covered by the open access  
obligation . 
Best practice: However, to ensure fuller and wider access, beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open 
access also to these other types of scientific publications (where possible).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Article 29.2  397 they may choose green open access with an extended embargo period which goes beyond 
six/twelve months.   
Finally, the ERC MGA foresees lighter requirements f or bibliographic metadata, focusing only on a 
persistent identifier (i.e. a stable address/marker to identify the publication, such as  a digital 
object i dentifier (DOI)75 or other systems).  
Best practice:  If the  repository allows for this, beneficiaries of ERC grants are strongly encouraged 
to ensure  that the bibliographic metadata also includes additional information such as the European 
Research Council (ERC) as funding source, the grant number, the title of the action and its acronym, 
the publication date, and the length of the embargo period (if a pplicable).  For ease of tracking, 
beneficiaries should include the digital object identifier for the 'European Research Council' 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781 ) in the funding acknowledgement field in their 
metadata, in addition to the digital object identifier for 'Horizon 2020' 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601 ). 
 
 
 
2. Open ac cess to research data  
This option will be inserted in the GA for ERC frontier research actions that  participate in the O pen 
Research Data Pilot (in line with provisions in the ERC Work Programme ). 
The rules on open access to research data are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 29 H2020 General MGA ). 
The ERC MGA has however the following  specificities : 
The data management plan (DMP) must address the following issues (the  use of the ERC template  
is strongly recommended but not mandatory) :  
1. Making data Findable  
2. Making data openly Accessible  
3. Making data Interoperabl e 
4. Increase data Re -use 
5. Allocations of resources and data security  
Moreover the DMP can provide justification  for NOT ensuring open  access to specific parts of 
the research data . For ERC actions, the exception allowing beneficiaries not to give access to 
specific parts of their research data applies not  only if this would jeopardise the main objective 
of the action, but any one of the action objectives. )  
 
 
 
 
 
A first version of the data management plan  must be submitted within the first 6 months of 
the project implementation  and should then be updated during the lifetime of the project , as 
needed.  
The beneficiaries may opt out  of the pilot at any stage  — both b efore signing the GA and 
afterwards (through an amendment; see Article 55  H2020 General MGA ). No reasons have to be 
provided for opting out. By opting out, they free themselves retroactively from the obligations 
associated with taking part in the pilot .  
                                            
75  For more information,  see http://www.doi.org/ . 
 For more guidance , see Open Access on the ERC website , the ERCEA Implementation Guidelines  and the ERC 
Scientific Council's Open Access Guidelines for research results funded by the ERC . 
 
 For ERC frontier research actions, the main objective is always a purely scientific one. The 
justification for non -disclosure therefore does NOT need to be the scientific objective of the action but 
can refer to other objectives, such as the intended later commercialisation of the scientific findings.

1. Working conditions — Rights  for the PI and his/her team  
In view of the key role of the PI and his/her team in ERC actions, the ERC MGA foresees a series 
of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions  and scientific autonomy  for 
them.  
Main obligations (towards the PI):  
 Scient ific autonomy , to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible conditions, 
and within the time agreed  
 Competitive working conditions , always in accordance with national law and institutional 
rules 
 Support for managing the action  (e.g access to infrastructure; legal, financial and 
administrative support)  
 Access to and protection of intellectual property rights  
 Allow and facilitate the  transfer of the GA to another host institution ( grant portability ). 
 
2. Supplementary agreement  — Obligations on the PI  
The ERC MGA foresees that the PI and its host institution must sign a supplementary agreement 
(SA), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also towards  the PI.  
Main obligations (of the PI):  
 Supervision  of the scientific a nd technological implementation of the action  
 Responsibility for the scientific reporting  and contribution to the financial reporting  
 Meeting the time commitments  for implementing the action   (v) general logistics of the action;  
(vi) access to the electronic exchange system (see Article 52);  
(g) inform the principal investigator [s] immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely 
to affect the Agreement (see Article 17);  
(h) ensure that the principal investigator [s] enjoy [s] adequate:  
(i) conditio ns for annual, sickness and parental leave;  
(ii) occupational health and safety standards;  
(iii) insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights;  
(i) allow the transfer of the Agreement to a new beneficiary (‘portability’; see Article 56a).

28  Commission Recommendation 2005/ 251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for 
the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p.67).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32.1  401 The PI must ensure a sufficient time commitment and presence throughout the course of 
the project to guarantee its proper execution.  
The two time commitment obligations  are as follows : 
 % of working time that the PI must work on the action  
 % of working time that the PI must work in an EU Member State or H2020 
associa ted country.  
To be operational , these two  percentages must be translated into  working hours , i.e.:  
 minimum number of hours that the PI must work in the action over its duration  
 minimum number of hours that the PI must work in an EU Member State or H2020 
associated country over the duration of the action.  
The calculation should be done  as follows:  
Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to:  
a) either the annual hours of a standard full time equivalent at the host 
institution, or  
b) 1720 annual hours (this option must be used in all cases when it is 
not possible to determine the number of hours of a full time 
equivalent at the host institution ). 
The standard full time equivalent (or 1720 annual hours) works as a ceilin g: 
they apply even if the PI works  in total  more hours (i.e. has other parallel 
affiliations, freelance activities or work -related obligations  or works more hours 
on the action). In this case, the time commitment is capped at 100% and the 
hours are calculated on the standard full time equivalent (or 1720 annual 
hours).  
By contrast, i f the PI works in total less hours than the standard full time 
equivalent (or 1720 annual hours), the time commitment obligation will be 
reduced proportionally.  
To do so , the percentage of PI commitment will be applied to the total work 
of the PI (instead of to options a) or b) above).  
The total work of the PI will be  determined by adding up all her/his hours of 
remunerated work, including under contracts with entities o ther than the 
host institution.  
Example:  The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 60 
% part time at the host institution and has another contract with a different 
entity to work 350 hours over the year. A full time equivalent at the h ost 
institution works 1750 hours per year. The hours that the PI works in total are = 
60 % of 1750 + 350 = 1 050 + 350 = 1 400. Since  this amount is lower than the 
full time equivalent, the time commitment obligation will be: 1 400 x 50 % = 700                                                                                            
Step 2  — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of hours 
over the action duration.   
The percentages must be re ached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per 
reporting period).   
The PI's time commitments obligations must be fulfilled  even if no personnel costs are 
charged for him/her to the project .  
 Applying the host institution ’s usual management practices  
 Informing the principal beneficiary immediately of any events or circumstances likely to 
affect the GA  
 Ensure the visibility of EU funding   
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32.1  402  Upholding the intellectual property rights  of the host institution   
This obligation is not limited to respecting  the host institution’s inte llectual property rights 
(IPRs). The PI must actively  inform it if s/he becomes aware of any violation s. 
Example:  The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s project 
IPRs. S/he is obliged to inform the host instituti on.  
 Maintaining confidentiality . 
The ‘supplementary agreement’  is an agreement between the host institution  and the PI, to 
set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant.  
It is purely internal ; the EU/Euratom is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it (nor 
for any adverse consequences).  
It should cover all the practical issues that may arise in the context of the grant 
implementation  (in particular the ones listed in Article 32.1(b) ) and  must remain in place 
at least for the action duration (see Article 3)  (— without any interruptions, even if the PI 
works only part -time on the ERC project ). 
It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the GA . (Provisions that contradict the 
GA are considered void and can not be opposed to the Agency.)  
It can NOT replace an employment or engagement contract between the PI and its host 
institution (which remain necessary under national labour and social laws).  
It must be concluded before  GA signature  (or in case of portability  before submission of 
the amendment request) and a copy must be sent to the Agency.  
A template  [ODT format ] for a model supplementary agreement  is available. (The model is 
not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided th ey benefit the research 
action and do not contradict the GA.)  
 
Specific cases ( supplementary agreement) : 
PI employed/engaged by a third party  — The supplementary agreement must be signed by the PI, 
the host institution and the third party.  
Several PIs  — For ERC Synergy grants ( i.e. ERC frontier research  grants with  several PIs), e ach host 
institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) they engage.  
No supplementary agreement — NO supplementary agreement is needed  for ERC PoC grants.  
PI entitled to sign the supplementary agreement  — If the PI is entitled to sign the supplementary 
agreement on behalf of the host institution (because of his/her position in the institution), t he 
supplementary agreement must be counter -signed by another perso n empowered by the institution . 
The principal investigator can  NOT sign his/her own supplemen tary agreement for both parties . 
Grant p ortability  — If the GA is transferred to another host institution (see Article 56a ), a new 
supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution (and forwarded to the Agency) . 
The new agreement  must take effect from the grant transfer date  (or before) . The GA cannot be 
amended before the PI has sent the new supplementary agree ment.

For ERC actions , the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see 
Articles 27.3 , 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2  H2020 G eneral MGA) . 
In addition, the beneficiaries must however make specific reference to the European

[…] 
38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem and the ERC logo  
Unless the Agency  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
and major results f unded by the grant must:  
(a) display the European Union emblem and the ERC logo and  
(b) include the following text:  
For communication activities: “This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) 
under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 
[number])” . 
For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result]  is part 
of a project that has received funding from the European Research Council (E RC) under the European Union’s  
Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No [number])”.  
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem and the ERC logo must have appropriate 
prominence.  
For the purposes of their obligation s under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem and the 
ERC logo without first obtaining approval from the Agency . 
This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem, the ERC logo o r any similar trademark or logo, either 
by registration or by any other means.

1. Addition of new beneficiaries  
For ERC actions, the rules on addition of beneficiaries are in principle the same as in the General 
MGA (see Article 56 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, unlike the General MGA, ERC mono -beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficia ry 
grants, by addition of a new beneficiary  according to this provision .  MULTI -BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
56.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble  
The other beneficiaries must accede to the Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see Annex 3) in the 
electronic exchange system (see Article 52) within 30 days after its entry into force (see Article 58)  
[OPTION  if Article 14 applies and joint and sever al liability has been requested: and, for beneficiaries for 
which the [Commission][Agency] has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party, by also 
submitting — at accession — a declaration on joint and several liability  (see Annex 3a) si gned by the third 
party].  
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into 
force (see Article 58).  
If a beneficiary does not accede to the Agreement within the above deadline, the principal benefic iary must 
— within 30 days — request an amendment to make any changes necessary to ensure proper 
implementation of the action. This does not affect the Agency’s right to terminate the Agreement (see 
Article 50).  
56.2 Addition of new beneficiaries  
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary.  
For this purpose, the principal beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with  Article 
55. It must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the n ew beneficiary in the electronic 
exchange system (see Article 52).  
New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).  
MONO -BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
56.1 Addition of new beneficiaries  
In justified cases, the beneficiary may request the addition of a new beneficiary.  
For this purpose, the beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with  Article 55. It 
must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic exchange 
system (see Article 52).  
New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the  date of 
their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).  
If a new beneficiary is added, the grant becomes a multi -beneficiary grant and [OPTION 1:  the preamble 
and the following Articles of the ERC Multi -beneficiary Model Grant Agreement wil l apply: 
[…][…][…][ same for further articles ]][OPTION 2:  the ERC Multi -beneficiary Model Grant Agreement

PORTABILITY OF THE GRANT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Transfer of the GA (portability)  
ERC grants  can be transferred  to a new  host institution (‘new beneficiary’)  — at any time during 
the action .  
 
 
 
 
 
The transfer may be based on any ground  that is beneficial for the PI  and supports achieving the 
action’s objectives.  
The former host institution (‘former beneficiary’)  may oppose  a transfer only if it is not allowed 
under national law. It may however nego tiate transfer conditions (including transfer of team 
members, intellectual property rights and equipment) with the new host institution , taking into 
account the view s of the PI.  
 
 Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the host institution  to a new 
host institution  — without passing via termination (Article 50) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 56).  
NO transfer before the amendment has been accepted by the Agency. Transfers without a formal 
amendment are void and may result  in GA terminati on. The former host institution remains fully 
responsible until the Agency has approved the amendment.  ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT TO A NEW BENEFICIARY — 
PORTABILITY OF THE GRANT  
56a.1  Conditions  
[The][A]  principal investigator may request the transfer of the action (or his/her part of it) to a new 
beneficiary, provided that the objectives of the action rem ain achievable.  
The principal beneficiary [OPTION for SyG and other ERC grants with more than one principal 
investigator: or, where applicable, his/her beneficiary]  may object only on the basis that the transfer is not 
possible under national law.  
56a.2  Procedure  
The principal beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment to the Agency (see Article 55).  
56a.3  Effects  
The former beneficiary must agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan to 
transfer the intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary  
The Agency will request the former beneficiary to transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre -
financing (see Article 21) not covered by an approved financial report.  
If requested by the pri ncipal investigator, the Agency may require the former beneficiary to transfer to the 
new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action (against reimbursement of the 
costs that have not yet been depreciated). The former beneficiar y may object only on the basis that the 
transfer is not possible under national law.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  ERC 
ERC > Chapter 7 > Article 56a  406 2. Procedure  
The PI should first contact the host institution  that signed the GA (i.e. the former host institution ).  
 
 
 
The former host institution must submit a request for amendment  to the Agency . 
For the amendment the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ). 
The transfer date  will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be selected in the amendment request . If the new host institution  joins the 
action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive date s are 
allowed , but only in exceptional cases and with a specific justification  (see Article 55 H2020 
General MGA ).  
The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
rights and obligations under the GA) of the new host institution (signed directly in the Funding & 
Tenders  Portal ), the PI's justification letter  and a supplementary agreement signed between the 
new host institution and the PI   
The financial reporting periods  will be automatically adapted  to match  the transfer date  (unless 
the transfer date coincides wi th the end of a financial reporting period) . Scientific reporting  
periods will usually remain unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific 
implementation of the action).  
 
 
 
3. Effects  
The principal  beneficiary must  — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of 
signature of  the amendment , whichever is the latest  — submit:  
 a financial report to the Agency  (for the open period until transfer)  
 a report on the distribution of payments (only in case of multi -beneficiary GA)  
 if the costs reach the threshold set out in Article 20:, a certificate on the financial 
statement (CFS) ( — even if this is not the last reporting period) . 
These documents will be used for calculating the interim payment due to the former beneficiary. 
The Agency will moreover  instruct the former host institution to transfer the remaining pre -
financing to the new host institution.  
If the PI requests it, the Agency may require the former host institution  to transfer  equipment  
that was purchased and used exclusively for the actio n.  
The former host institution  may oppose this only if it is not possible under nationa l law. It may 
however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution , taking into account the 
views of the PI.  
Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for 
the project. If it does so, it may declare the costs of this reimbursement (and any other 
related costs , i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions 
set out in Article 6 .  
 Record -keeping  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries and PIs should keep records of the consultation and decision -making process 
for each portability case.

ERC > Chapter 7 > Article 56a  407  
Specific cases  (portability) : 
Several PIs — In ERC synergy grants  (i.e. ERC frontier research  grants with  several PIs), e ach PI has 
the right to transfer his/her part of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure 
that the action’s objectives can still be achieved.  
Former host institution remains beneficiary  — If certain team members (or equipment) stay with 
the former host institutio n, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the GA is transferred and 
changed  into a multi -beneficiary grant agreement  (allowing both th e former host institution  and the 
new host institution to participate in the grant). T he former host institution stays on as beneficiary, the 
organisation  that hosts and engages the PI is the new host institution.  If the former host institution 
remain s only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth handover ), it can then be terminated at a later 
stage, via a beneficiary  termination (see Article 50.2  H2020 General  MGA).

ERC PoC  408 ERC PoC  
II.3 H2020 ERC PoC MGA : Annotations  
The H2020 ERC PoC MGA is very similar to the H2020 ERC MGA.  
Like the ERC frontier research grants, the ERC PoC grants have a principal beneficiary (who is also 
the host institution) and a principal investigator.  
There are however NO specific provisions on the working conditions of the PI and his/her team  
(Article 32 H2020 ERC MGA ), no supplementary agreement and no grant portability  (Article 56a 
H2020 ERC MGA ). 
The following annotations will only highlight the biggest differences. For the rest, the annotations

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. ERC PoC actions  
What?  ERC PoC  funds : 
 a ‘proof of concept ’ to verify the innovation potential of an idea from an ERC frontier 
research project .  
ERC PoC grants can cover any activities that develop research output towards new commercial or 
societal applications  (e.g. making a ‘business plan’ , technical issues and overall direction, 
intellectual property rights positioning and strategy, budgeting and other commercial parameters; 
connections to later stage funding; establishing a company; demonstration, testing, prototyping, 
piloting, design).  
ERC PoC grants can  NOT cover activities under the ERC frontier research grant (e.g. dissemination 
or publications of the results of the ERC frontier research action; pure research, especially 
research with no commercial potential)  or activities which are t he result of research not performed 
under the ERC actions (e.g. results of research not f unded  by the ERC action) .  
ERC PoC actions are normally mono -beneficiary actions, but can also be multi -beneficiary.  
ERC actions are funded under Part I  of Horizon 2020, ‘European Research Council’ (e.g. ERC-
2015-PoC).

20.3 Reports  — Requests for interim payments and payment of balance  
The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days following the end of each reporting period — submit a 
report to the Agency.  
The report  must include the following:  
(a) a summary  for publication by the Agency ; 
(b) an overview of the progress of work  towards the objectives of the action, including the

question, they must be converted at the average of the monthly accounting rates published on the 
Commission’s website, calculated over the corresponding reporting period.  
Benef iciaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in euro must convert costs incurred in 
another currency into euro according to their usual accounting practices.

1. Reports  
What & When ? For ERC PoC actions, the principal beneficiary must submit periodic reports  — 
only one if there is one r eporting period, otherwise one at the end of each reporting period.  
The report (s) must include the all of the following:  
 a summary for publication by the Agency  
The summary is a brief description of the action , presenting its objectives and the results 
achieved. It must be easy to read and understandable to a non -specialised audience. This 
will enable the Agency to publish it on the Commission’s website right away.  
The principal beneficiary must ensure that material submitted to the Agency for publication 
does not include any confidential material.  
 an overview of progress tow ards the action’s objectives (or an overview of the action’s 
results for the last reporting period)  
 information on the eligible costs, including a  table showing the breakdown of direct costs 
and a budget follow -up table  
 an individual financial statement.  
In addition, a summary financial statement , which counts as the request of payment, will be 
created automatically by the IT system, on the basis of all financial statements submitted by the 
beneficiaries and linked third parties for each reporting period.  
Moreover, for the last reporting period, a certificate on the financial statements  (CFS)  will have to 
be added  (if necessary) . 
How?  All reports mu st be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal  (see 
Article  20 H2020 General MGA ). 
 
2. Reporting period(s)  
ERC PoC actions normally have only one reporting period  (with one pre -financing payment; see 
Article 21 ). 
As a general rule, this single reporting period lasts 18 months  (and thus the entire action 
duration) . 
If provided in the GA, an ERC PoC action may however also have more reporting periods.

II.4 H2020 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA: Annotations  
Like the H2020 ERC PoC MGA, the H2020 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA is very similar to the 
H2020 ERC MGA.  
As the ERC frontier research grants, the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants have a principal 
beneficiary (who is also the host institution) and a principal investigator.  
There are however NO specific provisions on the working conditions of the PI and his/her t eam, 
and there is no supplementary agreement  (Article 32 H2020 ERC MGA ). Furthermore, there is no 
right of the PI to portability of the grant (Article 56a H2020 ERC MGA ) (although f or mono -
beneficiary grants there is the possibility, in duly justified cases, to transfer  the grant to a new 
beneficiary ; see Article 56.3 ). 
Also, under the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA the grant payment is based on pre -fixed lump sum 
amount and not on actual costs reimbursement.  
The following annotations will only highlight the biggest differences. For the rest, the annotations 
to the ERC MGA apply mutatis mutandis .

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. ERC PoC actions  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot funds:  
 a ‘proof of concept’ to verify the innovation potential of an idea from an ERC frontier 
research project.   
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants can cover any activities that develop research output towards new 
commercial or societal applications  (e.g. making a ‘bus iness plan’ , technical issues and overall 
direction, intellectual property rights positioning and strategy, budgeting and other commercial 
parameters; connections to later stage funding; establishing a company; demonstration, testing, 
prototyping, piloting , design).  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants can NOT cover activities under the ERC frontier research grant 
(e.g. dissemination or publications of the results of the ERC frontier research action; pure 
research, especially research with no commercial potential)  or activities which are the result of 
research not performed under the ERC actions (e.g. results of research not funded by the ERC 
action) .  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions are normally mono -beneficiary actions, but can also be multi -
beneficiary.  
ERC PoC L ump Sum Pilot actions are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘European Research 
Council’ (e.g. ERC-2019-PoC). 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS  
 
 
1. Estimated lump sum breakdown  
Differently from the ERC frontier research grants and the standard ERC PoC, the ERC PoC Lump 
Sum Pilot grants do not have any budget categories. Instead, they have a lump sum (for multi -
beneficiary grants, broken down per beneficiary).  
For multi -beneficia ry grants, the breakdown is used to determine:  
 the share of the lump sum to which each beneficiary is entitled for the work  
 the maximum amount for which each beneficiary is liable in case of improper 
implementation of the work.  
Example: On a grant involving three beneficiaries, the Agency carries out a review after the payment of the 
balance. The review  concludes that 50% of the work attributed to beneficiary A was not implemented as 
indicated in Annex 1. On those grounds, the Agency deci des to reduce the grant. According to Annex 2, EUR 
50 000 was allocated to beneficiary A. Therefore, beneficiary A will be liable in proportion to its tasks or 
parts of the action not implemented (i.e. in case of a 50% reduction, beneficiary A will be liab le for EUR 25 
000).   
 
2. Lump sum share transfers  
Unlike in the General MGA, transfers of ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot shares are only possible via a 
formal amendment (i.e. increasing the share of a beneficiary and decreasing the share of another 
under a multi -beneficiary action).  ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated lump sum breakdown   
The ‘estimated lump sum breakdown’ for the  action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the lump sum shares for the work per beneficiary [and linked third party].   
The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
beneficiaries. It shows the amounts tha t the Agency commits to pay if the action is implemented properly, 
regardless of the costs actually incurred.  
4.2 Lump sum share transfers   
The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 can be adjusted by transfers of amounts between the 
beneficiaries , but only via an amendment (see Article 55).

ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
 
 
1. Grant amount and form of grant  
How much & which form? The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not use the cost forms  of 
the General MGA, but is a lump sum grant (see Decision C(2018) 5960 ). 
The use of the lump sum will be set out in the ERC Work Programme.  
The lump sum is a fixed amount of EUR 150 000 for each grant. This amount takes already 
into account the H2020 ERC funding rate.  
There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is  correctly implemented (in line with the 
description in Annex 1), the beneficiaries are entitled to receive the fixed lump sum amount.  
 
 
 ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
5.1 Maximum grant amount  
The ‘ maximum grant amount ’ is EUR 150.000  (one hundred and fifty thousand euros).  
5.2 Form of grant  
The grant takes the form  of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action.  
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL  (direct and indirect) costs  for the action and it can NOT be 
increased.

1. Final grant amount  
For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same 
as for the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21 ). 
Moreover, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared cannot be higher than the 
amount fixed in Annex 2 anyways), there is NO need to calculate the:  
­ limit to the maximum grant amount or  
­ reduction due to the no -profit rule.  5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance with 
the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in the 
following steps:  
Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum for the approved work and reduction for non -approved work  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1   Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum for the approved work and reduction for non -approved 
work  
The amount of the lump sum corresponds to the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) declared by the beneficiaries 
[and linked third parties]  for the approved work in the financi al statement at the payment of the ba lance (see 
Article 20.4).  
The grant is reduced (see Article 43) for the part of the work that has not been delivered or cannot be approved 
at the payment of the balance).   
5.3.2  Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is further reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
other than improper implementation; s ee Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by 
deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant amount set out in 
Article 5.1.  
The final grant amount will be t he lower of the following two:  
– the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
– the reduced grant amount following Step 2.

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 3 > Article 5  419  
 
1. Revised final grant amount  
For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the revised final grant amount are in principle 
the same as for the General MGA (see Article 5.4 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculati ons are different (see Article 21 ).  5.4 Revised final grant amount — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 22) — the Agency reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
breach of obligations including improper implementation; see Article 43), it will calculate the ‘ revised final 
grant amount’  for the beneficiary concerned by the findings.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency b y calculating the concerned beneficiary’s share in the grant 
amount reduced in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations 
(see Article 43.2).

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
  
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Third parties involved in the action  
The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable to the ERC PoC 
Lump Sum Pilot MGA.  
The General MGA rules on third party involvement are limited in PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions to 
subcontracting ( Article 13 ) and linked third parties ( Article 14 ).  
The articles for purc hases (Article 10 ) and in -kind contributions (Articles 11  and 12) are not 
applicable to the PoC Lump Sum MGA. Beneficiaries may make purchases and use any in -kind 
contributions from third parties following their internal practices but not subject to other rules (as 
long as they are needed  to carry out the work of the action).  
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services ; 
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment;  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge;  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1  
in accordance with the specific rule s set out in Article 10 to 14a.  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the  Agency and the other beneficiaries for 
implementing the action.  
 
 
  For all types of third party involvement (purchas es, in-kind contributions,  subcontracts  and linked third 
parties ), the costs  are ALL covered  by the lump sum.  NO other costs will be reimbursed.

ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
 
 
1. Subcontracting  
The rules on subcontracting for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle the same as for 
the General MGA (see Articles 8  and 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA has however the following  specificities : 
The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT need to be included in Annex 1 or shown in the table 
of estimated costs in Annex 2 (there is no such table for the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot; Annex 2 is 
not the budget, but the estimated lump sum for mono -beneficiary grants/lump sum breakdown for 
multi-beneficiary grants). By contrast, the tasks to be subcontracted must still be ind icated in 
Annex 1, as it happens in the General MGA.  
The principles of best value for money and no conflict of interest are not explicitly mentioned in 
Article 13. Nonetheless, they must still be complied with and confirmed by the beneficiaries at 
proposal  stage . 
The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
‘other obligations’ . In case of breach, t he Agency may therefore reduce the grant in proportion to 
the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).  
The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations which occurred at proposal stage (see 
Article 43 H2020 General MGA ).      ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION  TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 Specific rules for subcontracting  action tasks  
Subcontracting may cover onl y a limited part of the action.  
The tasks to be implemented for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1. The Agency may however 
approve subcontract s not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Ar ticle 55), if:  
- they are specifically justified in the final report and  
- they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the Agency (see Article 37). ] 
The beneficiaries must ensure that the Agency , the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 als o towards 
their subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 3 6, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
subcontractors.  
13.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant ma y be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures des cribed in Chapter 6.

ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep records on their actual 
costs; they only need to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation, records) that 
the action tasks (as described in Annex 1) were properly carried o ut.  
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. It must be correctly archived — for at 
least 5 years after the balance is paid or longer if there are ongoing procedures ( such as audits, 
investigations or litigation) . In this case, the evidence must be kept until the end of the respective 
procedure.  
The records and supporting documentation must:  
 refer to the implementation of the action, in line with the accepted standards in the 
respective field (see Article  18 H2020 General MGA ) and 
 
 prove that the tasks or part of the action allocated to the beneficiary in Annex 1 were 
implemented properly (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA ).  
By contrast, timesheets or invoices for costs actuall y incurred are NOT needed.  
 ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default : five ][OPTION 2 for low value grants : 
three ] years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate records and other supporting 
documentation  to prove the proper implementation of the action.  
They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or  
investigations (see Article 22).  
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
other supporting documentation unt il the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The Agency may accept no n-original 
documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance  
Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation of the action 
must be in line with the accepted sta ndards in the respective field . 
The beneficiaries do not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the action.  
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) . 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
 If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
reduced  (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

1. Reports  
What & When?  For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions, the principal beneficiary must submit a 
final report at the end of the action.  
The report must include the following:  
 a summary for publication by the Agency  
The summary is a brief description of the action , presenting i ts objectives and the results 
achieved. It must be fit for publication and written in an easy to read language for a non -
specialised audience. This will enable the Agency to publish it on the Commission’s website 
right away.  
The principal beneficiary must ensure that material submitted to the Agency for publication 
does not include any confidential material.  
 an overview of the results towards the action’s objectives  
 an individual financial statement.  
The final report includes the completed work and the co rresponding lump sum shares per 
beneficiary.  (e) [OPTION 1 if the JRC is a beneficiary:  information on the amount of the payment of the b alance 
to be paid by the Agency  to the Joint Research Centre (JRC); ][OPTION 2: not applicable; ] 
(f) a ‘summary financial statement ’, created automatically by the electronic exchange system, 
consolidating the individual financial statements for the reporting period concerned and including 
the request for payment of the balance;  
(g)  a ‘certificate on the financial statements ’: not applicable  
20.5 Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
Not applicable  
20.6 Currency for financial statements   
Financial statements must be drafted in euro.  
20.7 Language of reports  
The final report (including financial statements) must be submitted in  the language of the Agreement.  
20.8 Consequences of non -compliance   
If the final report submitted does not comply  with this Article, the Agency may suspend the payment 
deadline (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
If the principal beneficiary breaches its obligation to submit the report and if it fails to comply with this 
oblig ation within 30 days following a written reminder, the Agency may terminate the Agreement (see 
Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  425 In principle, lump sum shares should be claimed only for work fully accomplished as described in 
Annex 1. However, if agreed by the Agency, the beneficiary may exceptionally declare partial lump 
sum shares for work not completed, for example,  due to technical reasons.    
Best practice:  In case of doubt, the beneficiary should contact the Agency about work partially 
accomplished.  
 
How?  The final report must be prepared  by the principal beneficiary  and the other 
beneficiaries  together , directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal ). 
In practice, the following steps will apply:  
Step 1  — The principal bene ficiary will indicate in the Funding & Tenders  Portal  if the work 
foreseen in Annex 1 has been fully accomplished during the action duration.   
Step 2  — The beneficiaries will have to sign individual financial statements to confirm proper 
implementation of their parts of the work and submit them to the principal beneficiary. All of 
them will be part of the final report.  
Step 3  — The principal beneficiary will submit the final report  to the Agency.  
 
 The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if:  
 the situation could  have been solved via an amendment.  
Example:  The beneficiary argues that a new research methodology made the planned methodology 
obsolete.  The new methodology could have been accepted via an amendment.  
 non-implementation linked to financial reasons  
Example:  The in -depth market study turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned.

ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS A ND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
 
 
 ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments to be made  
The following payments will be made to the principal beneficiary:  
- one pre-financing payment ; 
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
20). 
21.2 Pre -financing payment — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
The aim of the pre -financing is to provide t he benefic iaries with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of  the balance.  
The amount of the pre -financing payment will be EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ].  
The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre -financing  payment to the principal 
beneficiary within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 
days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest . 
An amount of EUR [ insert amount  (inser t amount in words)],  corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency from the pre -financing payment and transferred into the 
‘Guarantee Fund ’.  
[OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary:  Moreover, the part of the pre -financing payment related to the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) ([ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]) is not paid to the principal beneficiary, 
but kept by the Agency for the JRC.]  
21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculati on  
Not applicable  
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the lump sum for th e implementation of the 
action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44) .  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency will pa y the 
balance within 90 days  from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the final report and the lump sum shares for the work  declared. Their 
approval does not imply recognit ion of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of their 
content.  
The part of the work that has not been delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance will 
reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  427  
 
1. Payments to be made  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions have only one reporting period (see Article 20.2 ), with one pre -
financing payment.  
There are NO interim payments.  
The balance is paid on approval of the final report.  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries  
Beneficiary termination  
How much?  The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated by the Agency on the 
basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the report on the distribution of 
payments.  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 21.3 , 44.1.1 , 50.2.2  and 50.3.3 H2020 
General MGA ), however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU cont ribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs, but simply takes into account the lump sum share for the beneficiary’s accepted 
work.  
Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency may accept also part of a lump sum share for work 
partially a ccomplished by the beneficiary.  
 The amount due as the balance is calculated by the Agency by deducting the total amount of pre -
financing already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
pre-financing made }.  
At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
and: 
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the benef iciary together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid t o the beneficiary  
- is negative, it will be recovered.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any other 
amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated 
lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2).  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  428 Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination:  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C).  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 150  000. 
Lump sum share breakdown per beneficiary (Annex 2):  
  Lump sum shares for the 
work  Total EU contribution  
Beneficiary A  50 000  50 000  
Beneficiary B  70 000  70 000  
Beneficiary C  30 000   
30 000  
Total  150 000  150 000  
 
The participation of beneficiary B is terminated before the end of the project. The reason for terminating its 
participation is the non -availability anymore of a biosafety level 4 laboratory which has been damaged by a fire 
during the course of the action and where proof of concept activities for the second virus should have been also 
performed. Therefore, this beneficiary cannot complete its tasks due to force majeure (see Article 51 H2020 
General MGA ). On those grounds, the Ag ency decides to accept for that beneficiary a part of the lump sum 
shares proportionate to the tasks carried out by the beneficiary in the action (e.g. 50%). According to the 
distribution of payment, the principal beneficiary had transferred EUR 50 000 as pre-financing to beneficiary B.  
Amount due:  
Lump sum shares for partly accepted work = EUR 70  000 – 50% of EUR 70 000 = EUR 35 000  
Beneficiary B amount due: EUR 35  000. 
Beneficiary balance:  
Payments received by beneficiary B (according to the report on the  distribution of payment): EUR 50 000.  
Beneficiary B balance: EUR 35 000 (amount due) - EUR 50 000 (payment received) =  - EUR 15  000  
Since the payment received by Beneficiary B exceeds the amount of the lump sum share is entitled for its part of the 
work it has fully accomplished, there is a recovery of EUR 15 000 (see Article 50).  
 
Payment of the balance  
How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
be calculated by the Agency on the basis of the financial  statements, the final grant amount and 
the payment already made.  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.3 , 21.4 and 44.1.2 H2020 General MGA ), 
however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs, but simply sums up all the lump sum shares of the beneficiaries for the accepted 
work. Work partia lly accomplished due to scientific or technical reasons  may exceptionally be 
accepted by the Agency.  
 
 
Step 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
do not apply to ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants.  
 The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if:  
 the situation could have been solved via an amendment.  
Example:  The beneficiary argues that a new research methodology made the planned methodology 
obsolete. The new methodology could have been accepted via an amendment.  
 non-imple mentation linked to financial reasons  
Example:  The in -depth market study turned o ut to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned.

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  429 Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other  than non -implementation 
(because non -implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
All other steps fol low the General MGA.  
 
Example for calculating the payment of the balance:  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C).  
Beneficiary A is in charge of scaling -up activities , beneficiary B is in charge of health and safety testing activities and 
beneficiary C  is in charge of additional screening of target molecules as well as in charge of establishing a worldwide 
patent landscape mapping and an IPR strategy accordingly.  
Maximum grant amount: EUR 150  000. 
Lump sum share breakdown per beneficiary (Annex 2):  
 
  Lump sum shares for the 
work  Total EU contribution  
Beneficiary A  100 000  100 000  
Beneficiary B  20 000  20 000  
Beneficiary C  30 000  30 000  
Total  150 000  150 000  
 
Case 1:  
At the end of the action, it appears that beneficiar ies A and B fully completed their tasks. However beneficiary C 
completed only its tasks related to health and safety testing while it failed to establish a worldwide patent landscape 
mapping. The Agency decides to reduce by 10 % the lump sum share of beneficiary C corresponding to th e 
proportion of the undelivered part of its work. In addition, the consortium breached its obligation to promote the 
action and its results under Article 38. The Agency decides to reduce the maximum grant amount by 10 % for that 
reason.  
Final grant amount:  
Lump sum share for accepted work of beneficiary A + Lump sum share for accepted work of beneficiary B + partial 
lump sum share for partly accepted work of beneficiary C = 100 000 + 20 000 + (30 000 – 10% of 30 000)  
Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 147 0 00 
Grant reduction for other breaches: 10% grant reduction for the action = maximum grant amount – 10 % 
(reduction) = 150 000 – 15 000 = EUR 135  000. 
Amount resulting from Step 2: EUR 135  000. 
Lower amount of the two:  EUR 135 000  
Final grant amount: = EUR  135 000. 
 
Case 2:  
Work of beneficiary B and work of beneficiary C were not carried out (i.e. representing a total lump sum shares of 
EUR 50 000) and therefore the Agency reduced the grant accordingly.  
Final grant amount:  
Lump sum shares for accepted work: EUR 100 000  
No grant reductions for other breaches.  
Final grant amount: EUR 100 000 (  beneficiary shares: A = EUR 100 000; B = EUR 0; C = EUR 0)  
Balance & Guarantee Fund release:  
Payments made: EUR 127 500.  
Balance: EUR 100 000 (final grant amount)  - EUR 127 500 (payments made) = EUR - 27 500 (excess payments of 
EUR 27 500).  
Offsetting against Guarantee Fund release: EUR 27 500 - EUR 7 500 (i.e. 5% of EUR 150 000) = EUR 20  000 
Recovery:  
Amount to be recovered from the consortium:  EUR 20  000 (negativ e balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by 
the principal beneficiary, otherwise the Agency will start a recovery procedure against the beneficiaries that received 
excess funding).  
Recovery from the principal beneficiary:  
The principal beneficiary does no t reimburse the Agency and sends the report on the distribution of the payments 
among beneficiaries (distribution: A= EUR 75 000; B= EUR 25 000; C = 27 500).  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  430 Recovery from beneficiaries:  
Identifying the beneficiaries with excess funding:  
A: {(EUR 100 000 / (100 000 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 100 000 (share in the final grant) } - EUR 75 000 
(payments received) = EUR 25 000 (no payment in excess)  
B: {0 / (100 000 + 0 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 0 (share in the final grant) } - EUR 25 000 (payments received) = 
EUR – 25 000 (excess payment of EUR 25 000)  
C: {0 / (100 000 + 0 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 0 (share in the final grant) } - EUR 27 500 (payments received) = 
EUR – 27 500 (excess payment of EUR 27 500)  
Beneficiaries B and C r eceived payment in excess of its EU contribution and will have to reimburse the Agency.  
Beneficiary A will have to recover the money owed to it (if any) from the other beneficiaries in the consortium.  
Division of the debt:  
Relative share of total payment s in excess:  
Total payments made in excess = 52 500.  
B: 25 000 /52 500 = 47.62  %. 
C: 27 500 / 52 500 = 52.38  %. 
Total to be recovered: EUR 20 000.  
B: 47.62  % x 20  000 = EUR 9 524  
C: 52.38  % x 20 000 = EUR 10 476  
 
 
Audit implementation after payment of the  balance — Revised final grant amount  
The amount to be recovered (or paid) after the final payment will be calculated by the Agency on 
the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount.  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.4  and 44.1.3 H2020 General MGA ), 
however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Re -calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply; only Step 2 (Grant 
reductions) appli es.  
All other steps follow the General MGA (see for the calculations Article 21 H2020 General MGA ). 
 
Examples for calculating recoveries after payment of the balance:  
Case 1:  
Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B, C).  
Beneficiary A is in charge of scaling -up activities , beneficiary B is in charge of health and safety testing activities on 
50 samples and beneficiary C is in charge of identifying application domains and establishing a market deployment 
strategy accordingl y.   
Maximum grant amount: EUR 150 000.

Beneficiary C  10 000  10 000  
Total  150 000  150 000 
 
Final grant amount:  
Final grant amount:  EUR 100 000 + EUR 40 000 + EUR 10 000 = EUR 150 000 .

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  431 The Agency carries out a review  on the  action and finds out that beneficiary B carried out its health and safety 
testing activities on half of the number of samples foreseen (i.e. 25 out 50). The Agency therefore reduces the lump 
sum share of beneficiary B in proportion of the non -implemented work, i.e. 50% of EUR 40 000.  
Beneficiary revised final grant amount:  
Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary B: EUR 40 000 (accepted lump sum shares) — EUR 20  000 
(rejected lump sum shares) = EUR 20 000  
Beneficiary B revised final grant  amount: EUR 20 000 . 
The other beneficiaries final grant amounts (i.e. their final grant amount shares) remain unchanged.  
Beneficiary balance:  
The share of beneficiary B in the final grant amount = EUR 40 000 / 150 000 x 150 000 = EUR 40 000.  
Balance: EUR 20 000 (revised final grant amount) – EUR 40  000 (final grant share) = EUR -20 000 (excess of EUR 
20 000).  
Recovery:  
Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 20  000 (negative balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by the 
beneficiary).

OF FINDINGS  
 
1. Checks, reviews and audits  
The rules on checks, reviews and audits are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 22 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since (differently from ERC frontier research grants and the standard ERC PoC grants), 
ERC PoC  Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use actual costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
 there will be no financial  checks, reviews, or audits to check costs (since beneficiaries have 
no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action, even if they re main subject to 
the accounting rules under the applicable national law).  
 checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the implementation of the action (in particular full 
accomplishment of the work as described in Annex 1 of the GA), or on other aspects of t he 
grant agreement, such as promoting the action, visibility of EU funding, dissemination and 
exploitation of results, management of intellectual property, etc.  
Specific cases (a udits): 
Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Agency or the Commission may 
also audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost 
items for which it has fixed unit costs, flat -rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data 
to asses s the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for

ARTICLE 44 — RECOVERY OF UNDUE AMOUNTS  
 ARTICLE 44 — RECOVERY OF UNDUE AMOUNTS  
44.1 Amount to be recovered — Calculation  — Procedure  
The Agency will — after termination of a beneficiary’s participation, at the payment of the balance 
or afterwards  — claim back any amount that was paid, but is not due under the Agreement.  
Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt [OPTION if 
Article 14 applies:  (including undue amounts paid by the Agency for lump sum shares declared by its 
linked third parties) ], except for the amount retained  for the Guarantee Fund (see Article 21.4).  
44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation  
If recovery takes place after termination of a beneficiary’s participation (including the principal 
beneficiary), the Agency will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned, by formally 
notifying it a debit note (see Article 50.2 and  50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
terms and the date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debi t note, the Agency or the Commission will recover  
the amount:  
(a) by ‘offsetting ’ it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the 
beneficiary concerned by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU 
or Euratom budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial inter ests, the Agency or the 
Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
Agency:  if a linked third party has accepted joint and several lia bility (see Article 14), by holding 
the third party liable  up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the linked third party, in the 
estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2) and/or ][OPTION 2:  not applicable; ]  
(c) by taking legal action  (see Article 57) o r by adopting an enforceable decision  under Article 
299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty]  
and Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the  debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
be increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11, from the day following the 
payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receiv es full 
payment of the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late -payment interest and then against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiar y, unless Directive 
2007 /64/EC applies.

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 44  434 44.1.2  Recovery at payment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
notify a ‘ pre-information letter’  to the principal beneficiary :  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
- specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund;  
- requesting the principal beneficiary to submit a report on the distribution of payments to the 
beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification, and  
- inviting the principal beneficiary to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observati ons are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received, it will confirm recovery  (together with the notification of amou nts due; see Article 21.5) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and t he amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund, if the difference is positive  or 
- formally notify to the principal beneficiary a debit note  for the difference between the amount to 
be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is  negative . This 
note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If the principal beneficiary does not repay the Agency by the date in the debit note and has not submitted 
the report on the distribution of payments: the Agency or the Commission will recover  the amount set out 
in the debit note from the principal beneficiary  (see below).  
If the principal beneficiary does not repay the Agency by the date in the debit note, but has submitted the 
report on the distribution of payments: the Agency will: 
(a) identify the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:  
{{{{benefi ciary’s approved lump sum share   
[plus  
its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares] }, 
divided by  
the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for the approved work calculated 
according to Article 5.3.1}  
multiplied by  
the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) }, 
minus  
{pre-financing received by the beneficiary} }. 
(b) formally notify to each beneficiary identified according to point (a) a debit note  specifying the 
terms and date for payment. The amount of the debit note is calculated as follows:  
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned  
divided by  
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point 
(a)} 
multiplied by  
the amount set out in the debit note formally notified to the principal beneficiary }.

1. Recovery of undue amounts  
The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 44 H2020 General MGA ).  
However,  since for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations 
are different (see Article 21 ). 
 […] 
44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If, for a beneficiary, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5) is lower than its share of the final grant 
amount, it must repa y the difference to the Agency.  
The beneficiary's share of the fin al grant amount is calculated as follows:  
{benefi ciary’s approved lump sum share   
[plus  
its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares] } 
divided by  
the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for the approved work calculated according to 
Article 5.3.1}  
multiplied by  
the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) }.

ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
 
 
1. Suspension of the payment deadline (EU)  
The rules on the suspension of the payment deadline are in principle the same as in the General 
MGA (see Article 47 H2020 General MGA ).  
The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA has, however, the following specificities : 
Since there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could be doubts, the suspension 
ground for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants targets more generally any kinds of doubts about the 
amounts requested for payment (including doubts linked to work im plementation).  
 ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE   
47.1 Conditions  
The Agency may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 21.4) if a request 
for payment (see Article 2 0) cannot be approved because:  
(d) it does not comply with the provi sions of the Agreement (see Article 20);  
(e) the final report has not been submitted or is not complete or additional information is needed, or  
(f) there is doubt about amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) and 
additional checks , reviews, audits or investigations are necessary.  
47.2 Procedure  
The Agency will formally notify the principal beneficiary of the s uspension and the reasons why.  
The suspension will take effect  the day notification is sent by the Agency  (see Article 52) .  
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted  — 
and th e remaining period will resume.  
If the suspension exceeds two months, the principal beneficiary may request the Agency if  the suspension 
will continue.  
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non -compliance of the final report (see Article 20) 
and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, the Agency may 
also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see Article 50.3.1(l)).

50.1.2  Effects  
The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit the  f inal 
report (see Article 20.4).  
If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), the lump sum will not be paid.  
The Agency will calculate  the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the bal ance (see Article 21.4) on the 
basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only part of the 
work completed before termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the 
Agency.  
Improper ter mination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
36, 37, 40, 42, 43 and 44 ) continue to apply.  
50.2 Termination of the participati on of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
[…] 
50.2.2  Effects  
The principal beneficiary must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i)  a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and  
 
(ii)  if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘ termination report ’ from 
the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an 
overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial stateme nt (see Article 20).  
 
The information in the termination report must also be included in the final report (see Article 20.4 ). 
If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency (because it calls into question the decision 
awarding the grant or breache s the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may be 
terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement is amended  to introduce the 
necessary changes (see Article 55).  
The Agency will — on the basis of the termination report and the report on the distribution of payments — 
calculate  the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the payments received by the beneficiary 
exceed this amount.  
The amount which is due  is calculated i n the following steps:

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50  438  
 
 
 Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum share for the approved part of the work   
If the beneficiary’s part of the work is approved, the grant amount for the 
beneficiary corresponds to its lump sum share (see Annex 2) for the approved work  
declared in the termination report.  
Only the part of the work completed by the beneficiary before termination will be 
accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the Agency.  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud o r serious breach of 
obligations  
If the grant is reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
breach of obligation s other than non -implementation of the action; see Article 43), 
the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount for the beneficiary by 
deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness 
of the errors, irregularities or fr aud or breach of obligations, in accordance with 
Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary.  
The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.  
[…] 
50.3 Termination of the Agreement or of the participation o f one or more beneficiaries, by  the 
Agency   
[…] 
50.3.3  Effects  
(a) for termination of the Agreement :  
The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit the   
final report (see Article 20.4).  
If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit the report (see Articles 20.8 
and 50.3.1(l)), the principal beneficiary may not submit any report after termination.If the Agency 
does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), the lump sum will not be paid.  
The Agency wi ll calculate  the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21.4) 
on the basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. 
Only part of the work completed before termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed 
otherwise by the Agency.  
This does not affect the Agency’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose 
administrative sanctions (Article 45).  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency  (see Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50  439  (a) for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries : 
The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit : 
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned;  
(ii) a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
the estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annexes 1and  2) and, if necessary, the addition 
of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified after the 
period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the 
beneficiary concerned is the principal beneficiary. In this case, the request for amendment 
must propose a new principal beneficiary, and  
(iii)  if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a termination report  
from the beneficiary concer ned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing 
an overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 
20). 
The information in the termination report must also be included in the final report Article 20 .4). 
If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency (because it calls into question the decision 
awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement is amended  to introduce 
the nece ssary changes (see Article 56).  
The Agency will — on the basis of the termination report and the report on the distribution of 
payments — calculate  the amount wh ich is due to the beneficiary and if the pre -financing payment 
received by the beneficiary exceed s this amount.  
The amount which is due  is calculated in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum share for the approved part of the work  
If the beneficiary’s part of the work is approved, the grant amount for the 
beneficiary corresponds to its lump sum share (see Annex 2) for the approved 
work declared in the termination report.  
Only the part of the work completed by the beneficiary before  termination 
will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the Agency.  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud o r serious breach of 
obligations  
If the grant is reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities o r fraud or 
serious breach of obligations other than non -implementation of the action; see 
Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount for the 
beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion 
to the seriousn ess of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, 
in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary . 
The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.

ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
 
 
1. Transfer of the GA  
In justified cases, ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot mono -benefic iary grants can be transferred  to a new 
beneficiary.  
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT  
56.1 Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble  
The other beneficiaries must accede to the Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see Annex 3) in the 
electronic exchange system (see Article 52), within 30 days after its entry into force (see Article 58) 
[OPTION if Article 14 applies and joint and seve ral liability has been requested:  and for beneficiaries for 
which  the Agency has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party, by also submitting — at 
accession — a declaration on joint and several liability (see Annex 3a) signed by the t hird party ]. 
[…]  
56.2 Addition of new beneficiaries  
In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the  addition of a new beneficiary.  
For this purpose, the principal beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 
55. It must  include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic 
exchange system (see Article 52).  
New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).  
If a new beneficiary is added to a mono -beneficiary grant, the grant becomes a multi -beneficiary grant and 
the provisions will be applied accordingly . 
Article 56.3  Transfer to a new beneficiary  
In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono -beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the action to a 
new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach 
the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
For this purpose,  the beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 55. It 
must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic exchange 
system (see Article 52).  
The new beneficiary must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date 
of their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).  
  Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
beneficiary — without passing via termination ( Article 50 ) or addition of a new beneficiary ( Article 56 .2).  
NO transfer before the amendment has been accepted by the Agency. Transfers without a formal 
amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible 
until the Agen cy has approved the amendment.  
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 7 > Article 56  442 The transfer may NOT entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
award the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grant.   
Example:  The Agency will not accept the transfer to a host institution established in a third country.  
 
2. Procedure  
The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment to the Agency.  
For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ).  
The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be selected in the amendment request. The transfer date must be the same 
date as the accession date of the new beneficiary. Retroactive dates are allowed, but only in 
exceptional cases a nd with a specific justification (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ).  
The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
rights and obligations under the GA) of the new beneficiary (signe d directly in the Funding & 
Tenders  Portal ) and the PI's justification letter.  
 
 
 
3. Effects  
The former beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from the transfer date or the date of 
signature of the amendment, whichever is the latest  — a transfer report, with information on:  
 the progress of the work and  
 the financial statement (for the open period until transfer).  
This report is for information purposes only. The Agency will use it to decide on  how to split the 
lump sum share and instruct the former beneficiary to transfer  the remaining pre -financing  to 
the new beneficiary.  
The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must also be uploaded later on 
with the final report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement).  
The lump sum share will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary — on the 
basis of the part performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining part to be given t o the 
new beneficiary. If the pre -financing received by the former beneficiary (see Article 21 ) exceeds 
the amount of its accepted lump sum share, the Agency will request the former beneficiary to 
transfer the difference to the  new beneficiary.  
The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning 
the transfer of the equipment, materials and/or services purchased for the principal investigator.

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
1. MSC A-ITN actions  
What?  MSCA-ITN funds : 
− joint research training and/or doctoral programmes for early -stage researchers 
(implemented by networks  of beneficiaries from the academic and the non -academic 
sector from different countries).  
MSCA-ITN take s the form of European Training Networks (ETN), European Industrial Doctorates 
(EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD).  
MSCA-ITN are multi -beneficiary actions.  
They are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020 -
MSCA-ITN-2015). 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED [— COMPLEMENTARY GRANT] [ — JOINTLY 
FUNDED ACTION]  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled [insert title of the action ] — [insert acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in Annex 1.  
 
 For more information  on MSCA -ITN, see the Funding & Tenders Portal O nline Manual  and the H202 0 grants 
fact sheets . 
 For more information on the conditions for participation and funding, see the Funding & Tenders Portal 
Online Manual  or the H2020  Work Programme (section 3  MSCA) and the  call and topics pages  of the call.

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The MSC A-ITN MGA does not use the budget categor ies of the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the MSC A-ITN MGA:   
 costs for recruited researchers  
 institutional costs.  
 
 
 
2. Budget transfers  
The beneficiaries  may redistribute person -months between them (as compared with the original 
planning set out in Annex 2) . This redistribution can be done  without requesting an amendment 
(see Article 5 5 H2020 General MGA ) — provided that it does not imply a substantial change to the 
action as described in Annex 1 . 
 
 
Best practice:  The coordinator should inform the Agency in advance of any redistribution of 
person -months, in order to establish if an amendment is needed. Changes that only concern the 
consortium -internal arrangements on the redistribution of the unit costs for management and 
indirect costs do NOT n eed to be notified to the Agency .  
Example:  Beneficiary X was unable to implement six person -months, so the consortium informs REA of a 
redistribution of these months to beneficiary Y. REA agreed to this, but since beneficiary Y is located in a 
country whe re a higher country coefficient correction applies than in the country of beneficiary X, the 
budget transfer can only give 4.5 months to beneficiary Y.  
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The maximum grant amount (see Article 5)  can however NOT be increased .  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary and budget 
category  (see Articles 5, 6).  
4.2  Budget transfers  
The estimated budget breakdown indicated in Annex 2 may be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
beneficiaries.  
This does not require an amendment a ccording to Article 55, if the action is implemented as described in 
Annex 1.  
[OPTION for all actions except EID with only two beneficiaries:  However, no more than 40 % of the 
maximum grant amount  (see Article  5.1) may be allocated to beneficiaries located in the same country or to 
any one international European interest organisation or international organisation. ] 
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 2 > Article 4  448 A redistribution of person -months  will also have an impact on the institutional unit costs (since 
they are also paid according to the person -months declared for recruited researchers).  
Redistributions are subject to the following:  
 no impact on the action as described in Annex 1   
If the tr ansfer of person -months implies a substantial change of Annex 1, a for mal 
amendment (see Article 55)  is required.  
 correct application of the country correction coefficient  
 the minimum and maximum recruitment durations per researcher  
 for all actions except  for EID  with only two beneficiaries : a maximum of 40 % of the 
budget may be allocated to beneficiaries established in the same country (or to the 
same international European interest organisation or international organisation ). 
The 40% is determined on the basis of the maximum grant amount . 
Example:  In an action  with a maximum grant amount of EUR 3  000 000 , beneficiaries from one 
country may not receive more than EUR 1  200 000  (= 40%). If the final grant amount is lower  (e.g. 
because beneficiaries from other countries implement less person -months than expected ) the original 
40% ceiling of EUR 1  200 000  will be maintained (beneficiaries will not be penalised for the non -
execution of person -months by other beneficiaries).  
Transfers between budget cate gories  are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories  are 
linked to the same  person -months declared for the recruited researchers  (and i t is therefore 
technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 Redistributions of institutional unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done via 
an internal agreeme nt.  
 Institutional unit costs should be shared with entities with a capital or legal link which incurred 
costs for research training activities AND with partner organisations which incurred costs for 
hosting secondments (see Article 8 ). 
 Research, training and networking unit costs should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -
related purposes ( e.g. to increase the salary of a researcher or to organise additional training 
activities) . 
 Unit costs for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the action, 
but unused amounts may also be used for other action -related purposes ( e.g. to increase the 
salary of a  researcher) .

1. Maximum grant amount  
The maximum grant amount set out in this Article can NOT be exceeded.  
For MSCA -ITN, the maximum grant amount  is limited to a maximum unit cost equivalent of 
540 person -months (and for EID with only two beneficiaries: 180 person -months).  
 
2. Reimbursement rate  
How much? For MSCA-ITN, the reimbursement rate is set at 100  % (see the H2020 Work 
Programme  (section 3  MSCA )).  
 
3. Cost forms  
The MSC A MGAs do not use the cost forms  of the General MGA, but the unit costs  set out in 
Decision C(201 7) 685576.  
For MSC A-ITN, these are unit costs for: 
 costs for recruited researchers:  living allowance, mobility allowance and family 
allowance  (if applicable )

5.1 Maximum grant amount  
The ‘maximum grant amount ’ is EUR  [insert amount (insert amount in words) ]. 
5.2 Form of grant, reimbursement rate  and form of costs  
The grant reimburses 100  % of the action’s eligible costs  (see Article 6) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs 
grant ’) (see Annex 2). 
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words )]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘ form of costs ’): 
(a) for costs for recruited researchers  (living, mobility and family al lowances):  on the basis of the 
amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (‘unit costs’ ) and  
(b) for institutional costs  (research, training and networking costs and management and indirect costs) : 
on the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs ).

1. Final grant amount  
For MSC A, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since MSCA grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no -profit rule in 
MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).  
 5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4)  — 
in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1  Step 1  — Application of the reimbur sement rates to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by the 
beneficiaries and approved by the Agency (see Article 21).  
5.3.2  Step 2  — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
will be limited to the latter.  
5.3.3 Step 3  — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by deducting the 
amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant amount set out in Article 
5.1. 
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
- the reduced grant amount following Step 3.

ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Eligible costs  
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs  (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
conditions set out in this Article) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions , applicable per cost form  (for MSC A: only unit 
costs; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA ).  
Article 6.2  refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category  (see Article 4 ). 
 
2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible  
The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
6.1 H2020 General MGA ).  
 ONLY eligible costs  may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4 ) or declared  
in the financial statements (see Article 20 ). 
Record -keeping & burden of proof  — The burden o f proof  for eligibility is on the beneficiar ies. They 
must keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18 ) to show that the person -months  they declare 
are eligible.   
Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit  by the Commission/Agen cy. Any  
ineligible costs  found will be rejected  (see Article 42 ). ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 General conditions  for costs to be  eligible  
Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’) if:  
(a) they are calculated as follows:  
{amounts per unit set out in Annex 2  
multiplied by  
the number of actual units} . 
(b) the number of actual units complies with the following:  
- the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
- the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and  
- the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
documentation (see Article 18).

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility co nditions , applicable per budget category.  
The MSC A MGAs have their own budget categories , with their own types of costs , eligibility 
conditions and calculation rules . 
For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget category 
— the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
 types of costs covered by the budget category  
 cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSC A: unit costs)  
 eligibility  conditions  
 how the costs must be calculated.  6.2  Specific conditions  for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following two budget categories:

 A. Costs for recruited researchers  (A.1 Living allowance, A.2 Mobility allowance and A.3 Family 
allowance) are eligible, if:  
(a) the number of units declared:  
(i) corresponds to the actual number of months spent by the recruited researchers on the research 
training activities and  
(ii) does not exceed 36 months (per researcher) [;][, and]  
(iii) [OPTION for EID:  are, for each researcher, spent to at least 50  % with one or more 
beneficiaries or partner organisations from the non -academ ic sector. ] 
(iv) [OPTION for EID:  if spent on inter -sectorial mobility between academic and non -academic 
beneficiaries (i.e. not partner organisations): are international (i.e. spent between 
beneficiaries established in different countries).]  
(v) [OPTION for E JD: are, for at least two -thirds of the recruited researchers, spent in a joint, 
multiple or double degree programme with two or more beneficiaries or partner 
organisations stablished in EU Member States or associated countries.]  
(b) the recruited researchers compl y with the following conditions:  
(i) be recruited by the beneficiary under an employment contract  (or other direct contract with 
equivalent benefits, including social security coverage) or — if not otherwise possible under 
national law — under a fixed -amount -fellowship agreement with minimum social security 
coverage;  
(ii) be employed for at least 3 months;  
(iii) be employed full -time, unless the Agency has approved a part -time employment for personal 
or family reasons;  
(iv) be working exclusively for the action;  
(v) not have resid ed in the country of the recruiting beneficiary for more than 12 months in the 3 
years immediately before the recruitment date (and not have carried out their main activity 
(work, studies, etc.) in that country) – unless as part of a procedure for obtainin g refugee 
status under the Geneva Convention6. 
For beneficiaries that are international European interest organisations or international 
organisations: not have spent with the beneficiary more than 12 months in the 3 years 
immediately before the recruitment date.  
(vi) be — at the date of recruitment — an ‘early stage researcher ’ (i.e. in the first four years of 
his/her research career and not have a doctoral degree);  
(vii) [OPTION for 1 EJD:  be enrolled in a doctoral programme leading to the award of a joint , 
multiple or double degree in at least one EU Member State or associated country [;][.] ] 
(viii) [OPTION for 2 EID:  be enrolled in a doctoral programme. ] 
(c) the costs have been fully incurred for the benefit of the recruited researchers.  
This latter condition is met  if: 
{{{total remuneration costs  (salaries, social security contributions, taxes and other costs included in the 
remuneration under the employment contract or other direct contract) or  total fixed -amount fellowship costs  
for the researcher during the action

1. Researcher costs  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for the recruited researchers , by providing for:  
 a monthly living allowance  (A.1) — to cover the employm ent or fixed -amount 
fellowship with social security coverage  (i.e. gross amount, including compulsory 
deductions under national law , such as employer/employee social security 
contributions and direct taxes ) 
 a monthly mobility allowance (A.2) — to cover costs  related to their mobility  
(e.g. relating to travel and accommodation )  
This allowance covers  private  costs of the researcher s, not professional costs (which 
are covered by  budget category  B.1 ’research, training and networking costs ’) 
AND 
 a monthly family allowance (A.3) — for researchers with family, to reduc e family -
related obstacles to researcher mobility.  
 
 
 
What not?  Management and indirect costs  of the beneficiaries  are not covered  under this budget 
category ; they are covered  under category  B ‘institutional costs’ ( Article 6.2.B ).  
Example:  Costs for student registration, access to student services (library, computing , etc.), teaching, 
supervision, examination and graduation can only be covered by the institutional unit costs.  total mobility costs  (household, relocation and travel expenses and, if they must be paid under national law, 
taxes, duties and social security contributions) for the researcher during the action}  
plus 
total family costs  for the researcher during the action } 
divided by  
the nu mber of actual units } 
is equal to or higher than the following amount:  
{{amount per unit cost set out in Annex 2 as living allowance  
plus 
amount per unit cost set out in Annex 2 as mobility allowance}  
plus 
if it is due, amount per unit cost set out in Annex 2 as family allowance }. 
The family allowance is due if the researcher has a family at the time of recruitment.  
‘Family’ means persons linked to the researcher by marriage (or a relationship with equivalent status to a 
marriage recognised by the legis lation of the country where this relationship was formalised) or dependent 
children who are actually being maintained by the researcher.  
 
6 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol .   
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the researcher unit cost s (i.e. living, 
mobility and family allowances). They must be fully used for each researcher; they can NOT be used to pay 
other r esearchers or other types of costs (see Article 6.2.A(c)) .

H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  456 1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision C(201 7) 685577 and set out in 
Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
This is currently : 
 for the living allowance: EUR 3  270 per researcher per month (person -month)  
To ensure equal treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers, the amount 
for the living allowance is adapted per country, by applying a country -specific 
correction coefficient .  
The list of coefficients is published in the H2020  Work Programme (section 3  MSCA ) 
in force at the time of the call.  
On the basis of th is list, the beneficiaries must determine t he coefficient  for each 
researcher when s/he is  recruit ed — according to the country of recruitment . This 
coefficient normally  does NOT change during the action (unless the researcher is 
formally employed — not only seconded to — by another beneficiary in a nother 
country during the action ).  
 for the m obility allowance: EUR 600 per person -month  
 for the family allowance: EUR 500  per person -month . 
 
 
 
In practice, the declaration of costs for MSC A grants is very simple and almost completely 
automati zed: The beneficiaries must only indicate the number of implemented person -months (for 
researchers recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT 
system.  
1.3 The c osts (in practice for MSC A: the person -months) must fulfil the following eligibility  
conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
person -months must be linked to the implementation of the action , be i ncurred during the 
action  duration , be identifiable and verifiable , etc.; see Article 6.1 ) 
Costs NOT incurred during the periods of research training activities (e.g. during 
maternity/parental leave)  are ineligible.  
 be incurred for researchers that :  
 are — at the date of recruitment — early -stage researchers  (i.e. NOT have a 
doctoral degree AND be in the first 4 years (full time equivalent research 
experience) of their research career)  
‘Date of recruitment ’ means the first day of the employment of the researcher for 
the purposes of the action (i.e. the starting date indicated in the employment 
contract /equivalent direct contract; see Article 32 ). The Agency may however 
exceptionally  accept a different date, if it is linked to the recruitment and justified 
(e.g. by differences in the employment procedure in the country of recruitment) . 
Example:  The date of the formal letter offering the position under the action or the date of 
the sig nature of the employment contract can als o be accepted by the Agency as recruitment  
date.

MSCA ITN > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  457 Years of ‘ research career ’ are counted from the date on which the researcher 
obtained a degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme ( either in 
the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited) — even if the 
doctorate was never started or envisaged.  
 are recruited under an employment contract /equivalent direct contract  (i.e. 
other contract with equivalent benefits and social security coverage), including:  
 sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits  
 pension rights and  
 benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases .  
If national law prevents them from recruiting researchers under an employment 
contract /equivalent direct contract, beneficiaries may — exceptionally and subject 
to the Agency’s prior agreement  — offer a fixed -amount fellowship  with 
minimum social security coverage, including:  
 sickness , parental and invalidity benefits and  
 benefits for accidents at wor k and occupational diseases . 
In this case, the living allowance will be reduced by 50%.  
The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire recruitment of the 
researcher (i.e. also during secondments, if any).  
Staff provided by a t emporary work agency — Beneficiaries must always 
recruit researchers directly. Recruitments via other means (e.g. temporary work  
agency)  are NOT allowed.  
 as a rule, be employed  full-time  
Part-time employment can be accepted:  
 subject  to prior approval by the Agency  
 on personal or family grounds only (i.e. not for professional reasons ) and 
 if limited to a maximum of 50% of the time spent under the action . 
In the case of part -time employment, costs are reported as a pro-rata of the full -
time unit cost.  
Example: For one month of 50% part -time employment, 0.5 units should be reported . 
 
 
 
 
 work exclusively  on the research training activities  
Work outsi de the action is not allowed. Complementary skills training (e.g. teaching 
activity  as part of the research training ) is possible , but must NOT jeopardise the 
research training activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA ). 
 are supported for at least 3 months   
Person -months linked to shorter contracts will not be eligible.  
However, this requirement is linked to the duration  of the contract  and not to the 
actual duration of the train ing. If the contract is set out for a longer duration, but 
 While it is not possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons , 
beneficiaries may — in exceptional cases — request an interruption  of the employment. If the 
Agency agrees (beforehand and in writing), there is no need for an amendment or GA 
suspension; it is sufficient NOT to declare the months not worked .

resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.)  in the country of the 
recruiting beneficiary for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before  
the recruitment date  (— unless th e beneficiary is an ‘international European interest 
organisation’78 or international organisation, for whom the mobility rule is limited to 
time spent with them ) 
The mobility rule applies only to the first recruitment  under the action . For 
instance, i t does not apply to beneficiaries  or partner organisations  to which the 
researcher is sent or seconded afterwards.  
Short stays (such as holidays) , compulsory national services (such as mandatory 
military service ) and procedure s for obtaining refugee status u nder the Geneva 
Convention79 are NOT counted.  
 for the doctoral programmes (EJD and EID): are enrolled in a doctoral 
programme   
For EJD: 
 the PhD -programme must lead to the award of:  
 a joint degree (i.e. a single diploma issued by at least two higher 
education institutions offering an integrated programme and 
recognised officially in the countries in which the degree -awarding 
institutions are located) or  
 a double or multiple degree (i. e. two or more separate national 
diplomas issued by two or more hi gher education institutions and 
recognised officially in the countries in which the degree -awarding 
institutions are located).  
in at least one EU Member State or H2020 associated country   
and 
 at least two -thirds of the recruited researchers must be enrolled in a joint, 
double or multiple degree programme within Europe , i.e. between two or 
more beneficiaries or partner organisations established in EU Member 
States or Horizon 2020 associated co untries.  
The degree must not necessarily be awarded within the action duration. 
However, if requested by the Agency,  the beneficiary must be able to provide 
proof that the researcher actually received (or failed the examination for) the 
doctoral degree.  
 have been fully incurred for  the benefit of the researchers  (i.e. fully paid to the 
individuals  for whom they are claimed ) 
The beneficiary’s costs (gross amount) for researcher remuneration, mobility and family 
allowances must be at least as high as the living, mobility and family allowances set out in 
Annex 2.  Lower costs are considered as underpayment.  
Social security contributions and taxation (under national law) are to be counted as 
part of the beneficiary’s costs for the recruited researchers (gross  amount).

cooperation in Europe.

MSCA ITN > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  459 MSCA-ITN researchers must NOT be requested to pay tuition fees for their research 
training and/or PhD degree programme  (neither from their own funds , nor from the 
researcher unit cost ). The c osts that are usually covered  by such tuition fees (e.g. 
student registration, access to student services (library, computing , etc.), teaching, 
supervision, examination and graduation)  can be reimbursed  under  category  B 
‘institutional costs ’. 
The mobility and family allowances are due to the researchers for each month worked.  
Mobility and family  allowances can be paid to the researcher in various ways , for 
example  as: 
 part of  his/her salary  
 flight ticket s for private travels , directly purchased or reimbursed by the 
beneficiary  (work -related travels must be paid under category B.1 ’research, 
training and networking costs ’) 
 rental costs , directly paid  or reimbursed by the beneficiary.  
Any form is acceptable,  provided that:  
 both sides agree  
 it is allowed under  national law  
AND  
 there is no underpayment.  
Example: Researcher X decides to  rent an apartment of 750 EUR/month. If the beneficiary is 
willing to sign the rental agreement on behalf of the researcher and the researcher agrees with  this 
form of payment, the beneficiary will use 750 EUR of the total amount of 1  100 EUR (mobility & 
family allowance) to pay  the rent . The remaining 350 EUR must be paid as part of the salary  (or in 
another acceptable form) . 
Example: Researcher Y intends to travel to his/her home country for the summer holidays. S/he 
requests the beneficiary to directly purchase the tickets for him/her, and the beneficiary agrees to 
do so. The tickets cost 450 EUR and the beneficiary pays the remaining  150 EUR of the mobility 
allowance as part of the salary  (or in another acceptable form) .  
 
 
Amounts to be paid in other currencies  must be converted into euro as follows:  
 if a daily rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal  of the 
European Union  for the currency in question:  amounts must be converted into 
euro at the average of the daily exchange rates published over the 
corresponding reporting period, as reported on the ECB website80 
 if no daily rate is published: amounts must be converted at the average of the 
monthly accounting rates over the reporting period, using the currency 
converter  on the Comm ission’s website81.  
For ease of implementation, monthly allowances for the recruited researchers can 
be calculated using a conservative exchange rate , if a corrective payment is 
then made (to the researchers) immediately after the end of the reporting peri od. 
This must be clearly explained in the employment contract /equivalent direct 
contract  or fixed -amount -fellowship agreement.  
Example:  Researcher X is recruited in a country outside the euro -zone. The average 
exchange rate is normally EUR  0.9 but this flu ctuates from time to time. In order to ensure 
that the researcher receives a regular monthly income and to avoid exchange rate losses, 
the beneficiary chooses to apply a conservative exchange rate of EUR  0.87 and to make a

81  Available at http://ec.europa.eu/budget/contracts_grants/info_contracts/inforeuro/inforeuro_en.cfm . 
  Usually,  payment as part of the salary is the simplest  way to pay these allowances.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  460 payment to correct any underpayme nt at the end of the reporting period. The researcher is 
fully informed of this procedure at the time of recruitment.  
The Agency will check if the allowances are used fully for the benefit of the researchers. 
Any underpayments, if not corrected, may lead t o a rejection of costs (for that researcher).  
 for the family allowance: be incurred for researchers who have — at the date of the 
recruitment — a family, i.e. :  
 persons linked to them by:  
 marri age or 
 a relation ship with equivalent status to marriage (under  the law of the 
country  or region  in which this relationship was formalised )  
or 
 dependent children who are actually being maintained by the researcher . 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) as follows:  
 for the living allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of months actually spent by the researchers on the research 
training activities ( ‘number of implemented person -months ’) 
 for the mobility allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of implemented person -months  
 for the family allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2 )  x  number of implemented person -months  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For partial months  of recruitment, a pro -rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day  
(for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days) .  
Example:  If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the action , the calculation for the 15 days is:  
15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person -months.  
Periods in which a researcher was absent  for more than 30 consecutive days (for reasons other 
than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action (and must be removed from the 
financial statement, by changing the researcher declaration).  
Example s:  
1. If the researcher is absent for 30 consecutive days (or less) , the c osts incurred during this period can be 
charged to the action.  
2. If the researcher is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more) , no costs can be charged for this period 
(from the first day of the absence) . 
 Beneficiaries may declare a maximum of 36 person -months  per researcher. Person -months 
exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency.  
 For EID: at least 50  % of the number of person -months declared for each researcher must have been 
spent in the non -academic sector.  
This time does not have to be consecutive and may be split in time and between different 
beneficiaries/partner organisations /entities with a capital or legal link . The 50% must be reached by 
the end of the action (not before, e.g. by the end of a specific reporting period ).  
If the researcher unexpectedly leaves the action earlier (for reasons not linked to the beneficiary, e.g. 
because s/he resigns ), the Agency may  decide to nevertheless accept the costs — despite the 50% 
rule. 
Inter-sectoral mobility between beneficiaries must be international (i.e. spent between beneficiaries 
established in different countries).

1. Institutional costs  (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility  conditions  — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers :  
 research, training and networking costs  (B.1) — for: 
 costs for training and networking activities that contribute directly to the 
researchers’ career development (e.g. participation in conferences , trips 
related to work on the action , training , language courses, seminars, lab 
material, books, library records, publication costs )  
 costs for research expenses  
 costs for visa -related fees  (even if incurred before the recruitment date)  and 
travel expenses  
 additional costs arising from each secondment  of 6 months or less which 
require mobility from the place of residence  (e.g. travel and accommodation 
costs)  
Example: A researcher  does doctoral research at a beneficiary in Italy for 36 months. 
During this time, she goes on a 4 -month secondment to Poland.  The beneficiary must 
cover her travel and accommodation costs in Poland for this 4 -month period with the 
research, training and networking costs category.  
 management and indirect82 costs ( B.2) — for the beneficiary’s additional costs in 
connection with the action.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision  C(201 7) 685583 and set out in 
Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
                                            
82  For the definition , see Article 6.2 of the H2020 General MGA : ‘indirect costs ’ are costs that are not directly 
linked to the action imp lementation and therefore cannot be attributed directly to it.  B. Institutional costs  (B.1 Research, training and networking costs and B.2 Management and indirect costs) 
are eligible if  the costs for the recruited researchers (living allowance, mobility allowance, family 
allowance; see above) are eligible.  
 
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Budget flexibility  — There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 Redistributions of institutional unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done via 
an internal agreement.  
 Institutional unit costs should also be shared with entities  with a capital or legal link which incurred 
costs for research training activities AND with partner organisations which incurred costs for 
hosting secondments (see Article 8 ). 
 Research, training and networking unit cos ts should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -
related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of a researcher or to organise additional training 
activities, to cove r travel and accommodation costs for secondments of more than 6 months in line 
with the consortium internal arrangements) . 
 Unit costs for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the action, 
but unused  amounts may also be used fo r other action -related purposes  (e.g. to increase the 
salary of a researcher ).

MSCA ITN > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.B  462 This is currently:  
 for research, training and networking costs : EUR 1  800 per researcher per month  
(person -month ) 
 for management and indirect costs: EUR 1  200 per person -month  (for beneficiaries 
that already receive an EU/Euratom operating grant84 in the same period : only 
management costs,  i.e. EUR 600  — unless they can demonstrate that the operating 
grant does not cover any costs of the action; see Article 6.2.E H2020 G eneral MGA ).  
In practice , the declaration of institutional costs for MSC A grants is completely automatized  
because the IT system automatically calculates them on the basis of the number of person -
months declared under budget category A  ‘costs for recruited researchers’ . 
1.3 The eligibility  of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on ) the eligibility 
of the costs  for the recruited researchers.  
Institutional costs (research, training and networking costs, management and indir ect costs) 
are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the recruited researchers are met. Person -
months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for recruited researchers’ are also 
not eligible for budget category  B ‘institutional co sts’. 
Institutional costs can  NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs cannot 
be claimed without living allowance, etc.) . 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for recruited 
researchers:  
 for the  research, training and networking costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the researcher unit 
cost)  
 for the management and indirect costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2 )  x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the researcher unit 
cost)

‘Ineligible costs ’ are:  
(a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1), and in particular costs 
incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49);  
(b) costs declared under another EU or E uratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State and 
financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency  for the 
purpose of implementing the EU or Euratom budget), in particular, indirect costs if the beneficiary  is 
already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the same period, 
unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the action.  
(c) [OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work program me: [insert name of excluded

6.4 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For MSCA actions, t he rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do NOT apply. 
Instead , MSCA -ITN allows the beneficiaries to use:  
 entities with a capital or legal link to them  
and 
 partner organisations  
to carry out work under the action ( third parties involved in the action ).  
 
 
 
 
Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost  paid to the beneficiaries ; no additional 
costs will be reimbursed  by the Agency . (Beneficiaries are however encouraged to share the unit 
costs received with them ).  
Entities with a capital or legal link are similar to  linked third parties  under Article 14 of the 
H2020 General MGA   (i.e. entities with a link to a beneficiary , which is neither limited to the action 
nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation).  
Examples (entities with a capital or legal link):  
1. A university is beneficiary of an MSCA -ITN grant  (i.e. r ecruits the researchers),  but part of the research 
training under the action take s place at its university hospital (which is part of the same structure, but a separate 
legal entity).  ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- call upon entities with a capital or legal link  to the beneficiaries7, to implement certain action 
tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e. hosting a nd training of researchers);  
- call upon partner organisations  to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 
(i.e. hosting and training researchers during secondments).  
In this case, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency fo r implementing the action.  
 
7 ‘Entities with  a capital or legal  link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular, a legal or capital link, which is 
neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation.   
 
 
  Beneficiaries using third parties remain fully responsible  for the m under the GA.  
Best practice:  In order to be  able to fulfil this obligation, beneficiaries should make  internal arrangements  
(e.g. conclude partnership agreements  with partner organisations ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  465 2. A large multi -national company (which uses  a foundation or a subsidiary  for all its HR management, including 
concluding  the employment contracts and pay ing the staff ) participates in an MSCA -ITN action as entity with a 
capital or legal link implementing  the research training activities, while the foundation or subsidiary  participates 
as beneficiary (because it  can recruit the researchers) . 
3. A university hospital (which is part of  the public  health system without  legal personality on its own  and which 
uses a foundation for its HR management) part icipates in an MSCA -ITN action as entity with a capital or legal link 
implementing  research training activities, while the foundation  participates as beneficiary (because it can recruit 
the researchers) . 
Entities with a capital or legal link  may be used for hosting and training of researcher s (including 
during secondments) — and can even implement  ALL th ose activities under the action . But they 
can NOT recruit the researchers (only beneficiaries can recruit the researchers ). 
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
the link with the beneficiary, tasks to be carried out and time spent with them) .  
Contrary to linked third parties  under Article 14 of the H2020 General MGA , however, entities with 
a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
costs paid to the beneficiaries).  
Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
under H2020 as beneficiaries  (for instance,  be established in an EU Member State, H2020 
associated country or third country l isted in General Annex A to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
 
 
 
Partner organisations  are third parties  involved in the action without a  (capital or legal) link to 
the beneficiary .  
They may be used to provide training and host researchers , but only during  secondment s.  
 
Partner organisations  can NOT recruit the researchers (only beneficiaries can recruit the 
researchers) .  
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular, tasks to be carried out and 
time spent with them) .  
They cannot claim costs separately (since their c osts are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
beneficiaries).   
Partner organisations can be established anywhere  (EU Member State, H2020 associated country 
or non -associated third country) . 
 
 
 
 Secondments — For MSCA -ITN, secondments are (optional) additional periods of research training with 
another beneficiary or a partner organisation (from any country) in order to further enrich the training 
experience of t he researchers.  
They are limited to a  maximum of 30% of the time that is declared for research training activities (i.e. 
the person -months for the researcher)  — except in EID or EJD.  
If the researcher unexpectedly leaves the action earlier (for reasons not linked to the beneficiary; e.g. 
because s/he resigns ), the Agency may decide to nevertheless accept the costs — despite the 30% 
rule. 
The beneficiar ies remain fully responsible  for the action  implementation (in accordance with the GA ) also 
during a secondment.  
 
 
 
 
 For more information on conditions for participation and funding, see the H2020  Work Programme

MSCA ITN > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  466 Specific cases (third parties involved in the action):  
Authorisation to administer  — Coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments 
and  coordinators that are public  bodies may exceptionally  delegate the administration of the payments  
to another  legal entit y (third party ), in most cases a foundation . 
The third party must fulfil the following conditions:  
 it must  have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’  by the coordinator  
AND 
 it must be  affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its admin istrative 
affairs, including receiving and administering EU funds.  
 
 
 
 
In this case, t he option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisation s to administer must be added to the grant 
agreement.  The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8 must be that of the entity with 
the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
therefore be registered in the Participant Register  and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will  get 
its own PIC  — although it is not a b eneficiary.  
Since MSCA -ITN uses unit costs, no additional costs arise for the action. The costs of the entity are 
covered by the unit costs paid to the coordinator (see Article 6 ).  
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer  remain fully responsible  for it under 
the GA .

ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Records  and other supporting documentation  
For MSC A-ITN, simplified rules on record -keeping apply: Beneficiaries only need to keep 
appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person -months declared are correct, i.e.:  
 the employment contracts (or other suitable documents, e.g. fixed-fellowship agreements ) 
 proof that:  
 the eligibility conditions for the researchers were complied with (e.g. CV showing 
the researcher’s seniority, copies of diplomas , documents relating to re cruitment  
procedure ) 
 the researchers actually worked on the action (e.g. lab books, scientific articles, 
library records)   
 the obligations set out in Article 32  were complied with  
 the living, mobility and family allowan ces (including the employer’s compulsory 
social security payments) were fully paid to the researchers.  
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  
It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid ( 3 years for gra nts up 
to EUR 60  000) or longer if  there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or 
litigation) . In this case , the evidence must be kept until the y end. 
 
 
 
  Costs that are not supported by appr opriate and sufficient evidence  may be rejected  (and other measures 
described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).  
Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents will bear the full risk  of cost rejection by the Agency .

ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Deliverable: Progress report  
What & When?  The coordinator must — within 30 days after the first year  of the action — send 
to the Agency a progress report, to inform it about progress on the action.  
How?  The report  must be uploaded directly in  the Funding & Tenders P ortal. 
 
2. Deliverable: Mid -term meeting  
What & When?  The coordinator must  — before the deadline for the periodic report for RP 1  — 
organise a mid -term meeting . 
Best practice: It is good practice  to send the Agency a draft version of the periodic report (in good 
time before the meeting) . 
 
3. Deliverable: Researcher declaration  
What  & When?  The beneficiary must submit  to the Agency  a researcher declaration  for each 
recruited researcher  — within 20 days after the recruitment date. 
It is important to give co rrect and complete information in the researcher declaration since the 
data will be automatically inserted in Annex 4 (financial statement), for calculating the living, 
mobility and family allowance units. If the researcher declaration is not provided, it will NOT be 
possible  to declare person -months for that researcher.  
How? The researcher declaration s must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding &

1. Access rights for researchers  
In view of the key role of the recruited researchers in MSC A-ITN, the MSC A-ITN MGA foresees 
special access rights for them  (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25  and 31 
H2020 General MGA ): 
The beneficiaries must give the recruited researchers access  to both background  AND results 
necessary for their research training activities.  
‘Background ’ means any data, know -how or information — whatever its form or nature 
(tangible or intangible ), inclu ding any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
 is held by beneficiaries  before they accede to the GA  
 is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
AND that  
 has been  identified by the beneficiaries  in accordance with Article 24.  
‘Results ’ means any (tangible or intangible ) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected  or not — that is  
generated in the action as well as any rights  attached to it , including intellectual property 
rights.  
Beneficiaries must moreover ensure that partner organisations  and entities with a capital or 
legal link  give similar access.  ARTICLE 31 — ACCESS RIGHTS TO RESULTS

1. Recruitment and working conditions — Rights for the researchers  
In view of the key role of the recruited researchers in MSC A-ITN, the MSC A-ITN MGA foresees a 
series of obligations in order to guarantee objective recruitment procedures and best possible 
working conditions.  
Main obligations (towards the researcher):  
 Advertise and publish vacancies  internationally  
Beneficiaries must publish vacancies as widely as possible, including on the EURAXESS Jobs 
Portal85. They may also use their networks to ensure the widest possible dissemination of 
vacancies and inf ormation about the application process.  
 Follow an open, transparent, impartial and equitable recruitment procedure  (i.e. merit 
based, taking into account potential for their professional development and promoting equal 
access for women and men)  
 Ensure that no conflict of interest  exists in or arises from the recruitment (i.e.  take or 
refrain from action, as appropriate, where the impartial and objective performance of 
recruitment duties is compromised for reasons involving:  
 family  
 emotional life  
 political or national affinity  
 economic interest or  
 any other shared interest)  
 Ensure that the researchers enjoy at the place of the implementation at least the same 
standards  and working conditions  as those applicable to local researchers holding a 
similar position  
 Host the researchers at their premises (or those  of an entity with a capital or legal link ) and 
provide training  as well as the necessary means for implementing the action  (or ensure 
that this is  provided by the entity with a capital or legal link).

(i) ensure that the researchers do not receive, for activities carried out in the frame of the action, other 
incomes than those received from the beneficiaries (or other entity mentioned in Annex 1);  
(j) ensure that the researchers do not have to bear any costs for the implementation of the action as 
described in Annex 1;  
 
(k) host the researchers at their premises (or at the premises of an entity with a capital or legal link);  
(l) provide training and the neces sary means for implementing the action (or ensure that such training 
and means are provided by entities with a capital or legal link);  
(m) ensure that the researchers are adequately supervised;  
(n) ensure that a career development plan is established and support i ts implementation;  
(o) ensure an appropriate exposure to the non -academic sector;  
(p) limit secondments  to a maximum of 30  % of the actual months spent implementing the research 
training activities under the action.

16 Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of  11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for 
the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p.67). 
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32.1  472 If the Agency finds that a beneficiary is not supporting the research training activities in line 
with Annex 1 of the GA, it may reduce the grant.  
 Ensure that the researchers are adequately supervised  
 Ensure that a career de velopment plan  is established and support its implementation  
 Ensure an appropriate exposure to  the non-academic sector  
 Ensure that secondments  are limited  to a maximum  of 30 % of the months declared for  
research training activities (i.e. the person -months  for the researcher)  — except in EID or 
EJD, provided that it is in line with the proposal description and in compliance with the 
conditions set out in the call.  
 
 
 
 
If the researcher unexpectedly leaves the action  earlier (for reasons not linked to the 
beneficiary; e.g. because s/he resigns ), the Agency may decide to nevertheless accept 
the costs  — despite the 30% rule . 
 Ensure that the researchers do NOT receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the 
action ) other incomes  than those received from the beneficiaries (or any other entity 
referred to in Annex 1)  
 Ensure that the researchers do NOT have to bear any cos ts for the implementation of the 
action as described in Annex 1  
Recruited researchers must NOT be requested to pay visa -related fees or tuition fees for 
their research training and/or PhD degree programme ( e.g. student registration, , access to 
student serv ices ( e.g. library, computin g, etc.), teaching, supervision, examination and 
graduatio n) neither from their own funds, nor from the researcher unit cost.  
 Comply with the arrangements on intellectual property rights  
Assistance with intellectual property rights can be obtained via the IPR Helpdesk86. 
 Assist  the researchers in the administrative procedures  related to their recruitment 
(e.g. helping with visa procedures or prepa ring the career development plan)   
Assistance with relocating researchers can be obtained via  EURAXESS Services87. 
 Inform  the researchers about key elements of the grant  
Thus, beneficiaries must provide researchers with information on:  
 basic facts about the Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions, to make the researcher aware 
that s/he is a MSCA fellow , including:  
 the researcher’s rights and obligations and  
 where to look for details ( MSCA website , Funding & Tenders Portal , Marie 
Curie Alumni Association (MCAA), etc.)  
 the specific action in question (e.g. planned  secondments, events, etc.)  and 
 whom they have appointed to supervise them for the duration of the research 
training activities (including during secondments with other beneficiaries and/or 
partner organisations).  
Moreover, the employment contract/equivale nt direct contract (or fixed -amount -fellowship 
agreement) contract must clearly state:  
 the starting date of research training activities under the action and its duration  
                                            
86  Available at https://www.iprhelpdesk.eu/ . 
87  Available at http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/ . 
 Secondments — For MSCA -ITN, secondments are (optional) additional periods of 
research training with another beneficiary or a partner organisation (from any country), in 
order to further enrich the training experience of the researchers (see Article 8 ).  
 
 
 
 
 

H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -ITN MGA  
MSCA ITN > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32.1  473  the allowances that the researcher is entitled to receive (and if this is paid in a 
currency other than the euro, the exchange rate;  for the exchange rate, see Article 
6.2 H2020 General MGA ).  
The employment contract can state the total/annual salary — as long as it is 
possible to determine the monthly salary (e.g. by dividing the annual salary by 
12). 
 
2. Employment contract — Obligations on the researchers  
The MSC A-ITN GA foresees that there must be an employment contract /equivalent direct contract 
(or fixed-amount -fellowship agreement), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also 
towards  the researchers.  
Main obligations (of the researchers):  
 Work exclusively  on the research training activities  under the action  
This also means that a researcher can NOT hold two MSC A grants at the same time  or 
engage in another professional activity or employment.  Complementary skills training  
(e.g.  teaching activity as part of the research training)  is possible, but must NOT 
jeopardise the research activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA).  
 Not receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the action) other incomes  than those 
received from their beneficiary (or any other entity refe rred to in Annex 1)  
Example:  If the researcher’s allowances fall short of the legal minimum salary in the country in 
question, the beneficiary (or other entity in Annex 1) may pay a top -up to make up the difference.  
 Inform  their beneficiary  as soon as poss ible of any events or circumstances likely to affect 
the GA (such as, significant changes to their career development plan or personal 
circumstances affecting the foreseen activities)  
 Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights  
 Maintain confidentiality  
 Ensure the visibility of EU funding  
Researchers must acknowledge funding under the MSCA  grant in publications, 
communications or patent applications.  
 Complete and submit — at the end of the training — the evaluation question naire and — 
two years later — the follow -up questionnaire provided by the Agency.

1. Communication activities ( consortium ) — Promoting the action — Mainstream 
media coverage  
For MSC A, the rules for promoting the action are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 38.1. 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, b eneficiaries must inform the Agency not only before a communication activity expected 
to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream media 
coverage  (i.e. coverage in any forms of media , e.g. print, TV, radio and electroni c, addressing a 
non-specialist, non -scientific audience , e.g. local, regional or national news ). This allows the ARTICLE 38 — PROMOTING THE ACTION — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
38.1  Communication activities by beneficiaries  
38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results  
The beneficiaries must promote the action  and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
audiences (including  the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner.  
This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply.  
Before enga ging in a communication activity expected to have a mainstream media coverage  the 
beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52) . 
38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem  
Unless the Agency  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
and major results funded by the grant must:  
(a) display the EU e mblem and  
(b)  include the following text:  
For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreement No [number]."  
For infrastructu re, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreeme nt No [number].”  
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
first obtaining approval from the Agency . 
This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
or by any other means.

2. Visibility of EU funding  
For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA ). 
In addition, the beneficiaries must make specific reference to the MSCA  grant . Thus, the clause 
acknowledging EU funding is slightly adapted.

1. MSC A-IF actions  
What?  MSCA-IF funds : 
 the recruitment of an experienced researcher for research training activities (‘fellowship’).  
MSCA-IF take the form of  European Fellowships (EF) and Global Fellowships (GF). European 
Fellowships include three additional funding strands: the ‘ Career Restart Panel’, the ‘Reintegration 
Panel’ and the ‘Society & Enterprise Panel ’. 
The MSCA -IF annotations are equally applicable to the Widening Fellowships (see H2020 Work 
Programme (section 15 Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation) ). 
MSCA-IF are mono -beneficiary actions.  
They are funded under Part I of  Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020 -
MSCA -IF-2014). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE  2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED

ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Action s tarting date  
For MSC A-IF, the rules on the action starting date are in principle the same as in the General MGA 
(see Article  3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, the MSC A-IF MGA provides for an additional option, where the  actual  starting date must 
be notified  by the beneficiary (i.e. is not set by the Agency, but depends on the beneficiary).  
In this  case, there will be a maximum deadline for notification  set out in Article 3  for both 
starting the action and notifying this to the Agency  (normally 12 months  from the ent ry into force  
of the GA ). 
The notification must be done directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
Late notification will delay the pre -financing payment (see Article 21.2 H2020 General MGA ). 
If the action does not start or the starting date is not notified in time, the Agency may terminate 
the GA (see Article 50  H2020 General MGA ).  
 ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
The duration of the action will be [ insert number ] months  as of [OPTION 1 by default:  the first day of the 
month following the date the Agreement enters into force (see Article 58)] [ OPTION 2 if needed for the 
action:  the effective starting date notified by the beneficiary, which must be within [ insert number ] months 
from the date the Agreement enters into force] [ OPTION 3 if needed for the action:  [insert date ]]4 
(‘starting date of the action ’).

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The MSC A-IF MGA does not use the budget categories  of the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the MSC A-IF MGA:   
 costs for the recruited researcher  
 institutional costs.  
 
 
 
2. Budget transfers  
Given that MSC A-IF is a mono -beneficiary action, there is NO redistribution of person -months  
between beneficiaries . 
Transfers between budget categories  are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories are 
linked to the same  person -months declared for the recruited researcher  (and i t is therefore 
technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another) . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20  and Annex 4).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down for the beneficiary, by budget 
category  (see Articles 5, 6).  
4.2 Budget transfers  
Not applicable  
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 The institutional unit cost should be shared with entities with a capital or legal link which incurred 
costs for research training activities AND with partner organisations which incurred costs for 
hosting secondments ( including for GF outgoing phase; see Article 8 ). 
 The research, training and networking unit cost should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -
related purposes  (e.g. to increase the salary of the researcher or to organise additional training 
activities) . 
 The unit cost for management and indirec t costs  should be used for the management of the action, 
but unused amounts  may also be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to increase the 
salary of the researcher ).

2. Cost forms  
The MSC A MGAs do not use the cost forms  of the General MGA, but the  unit costs  set out in 
Decision C(201 7) 685588.  
For MSC A-IF, these are unit costs for: 
 costs for the recruited researcher:  living allowance, mobility allowance and family 
allowance  (if applicable)  
 institutional costs: research, training and networking costs and management and 
indirect costs.  
These are fixed amounts that must be multiplied by the number of months the recruited  
researchers spent on research training activities (person -months); they cannot be changed.  
The eligibility conditions are set out in Article 6 .

The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words )]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘ form of costs ’): 
(a) for costs for the recruited researcher  (living, mobility and family allowances):  on the basis of the 
amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (‘unit costs’ ) and  
(b) for institutional costs  (research, training and networking costs and management and indirect 
costs) : on the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs ).

1. Final grant amount  
For MSC A, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since MSC A grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no -profit rule in 
MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).  
 
 5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4)  — 
in the following steps:  
Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1  Step 1  — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared 
by the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21).  
5.3.2  Step 2  — Limit  to the maximum grant amount  
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
will be limited to the latter.  
5.3.3 Step 3  — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximum grant amount by 
deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fraud or  breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount set 
out in Article 5.1.  
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
- the re duced grant amount following Step 3.

1. Eligible costs  
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs  (i.e. costs that comply with the general and 
specific conditions set out in this Article) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions , applicable per cost form  (for MSC A: only unit 
costs; see Article 5 ).  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category  (see Article 4 ). 
 
2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible  
The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the  same as in the General MGA (see Article 
6.1 H2020 General MGA ).  
 ONLY eligible costs  may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4 ) or declared  in 
the financial statements (see Article 20 ). 
Record -keeping & burden of proof  — The burden o f proof  for eligibility is on the beneficiar y. It must 
keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18 ) to show that the person -months  it declare s are eligible.   
Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit  by the Commission/Agency. Any  
ineligible costs  found will be rejected  (see Article 42 ). ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible  
Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’) if:  
(a) they are calculated as follows:  
{amounts per unit set out in Annex 2  
 multiplied by  
the number of actual units} . 
(b) the number of actual units complies with the following:  
- the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
- the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and  
- the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
documentation (see Article 18) .

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category.  
The MSC A MGAs have their own budget categories , with their own types of costs , eligibility  
conditions and calculation rules . 
For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget category 
— the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
 types of costs covered by the budget category  
 cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSC A : unit costs)  
 eligibility conditions  
 how the costs must be calculated.  6.2  Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following two budget categories:

1. Researcher costs  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for the recruited researcher , by providing for:  
 a monthly living allowance (A.1) — to cover the employm ent or fixed -amount 
fellowship with social security coverage  (i.e. gross amount, including compulsory A. Costs for the recruited researcher  (A.1 Living allowance, A.2 Mobility allowance and A.3 Family 
allowance)  are eligible, if:  
(a) the number of units declared:  
(i) corresponds to the actual number of months spent by the recruited res earcher on the research 
training activities and  
(ii) does not exceed [OPTION 1 by default:  24] [ OPTION 2 for EF -CAR : 36] [ OPTION 3 for GF : 
36] months;  
(b) the recruited researcher complies with the following conditions:  
(i) be recruited by the beneficiary under an employment contract  (or other direct contract with 
equivalent benefits, including social security coverage) or — if not otherwise possible under 
national law — under a fixed -amount -fellowship agreement with minimum social security 
coverage, including perio ds of secondment to  ' partner organisations '; 
(ii) be employed full -time, unless the Agency has approved a part -time employment for professional,  
personal or family reasons (see Article 55), and  
(iii) be working exclusively for the action.  
(c) the costs have been fully incurred for the benefit of the recruited researcher.  
This latter condition is met if:  
{{{total remuneration costs  (salaries, social security contributions, taxes and other costs included in the 
remuneration under the employment contract or other direct co ntract) or  total fixed -amount fellowship costs  for 
the researcher during the action  
plus 
total mobility costs  (household, relocation and travel expenses and, if they must be paid under national law, 
taxes, duties and social security contributions) for the researcher during the action}  
plus 
total family costs  for the researcher during the action } 
divided by  
the number of actual units }. 
is equal to or higher than the following amount:  
{{amount per unit cost set out in Annex 2 as living allowance  
plus 
amount p er unit cost set out in Annex 2 as mobility allowance}  
plus 
if it is due, amount per unit cost set out in Annex 2 as family allowance }. 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  484 deductions under national law, such as employer/employee social security 
contributions and direct taxes ) 
 a monthly mobility allowance  (A.2) — to cover costs  related to his/her mobility  
(e.g. relating to travel and accommodation )  
This allowance covers private  costs of the researcher, not professional costs (which are 
covered by  category  B.1 ’research, training and networking costs ’). 
AND 
 a monthly family allowance  (A.3) — if the researcher has family, to reduce family -
related obstacles to researcher mob ility.  
 
 
 
What not?  Management and indirect costs of the beneficiary are not covered  under this budget 
category ; they are covered  under category B ‘institutional costs’ ( Article 6.2.B ). 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision  C(201 7)6855 89 and set out  in 
Annex 2 and 2a of the GA .  
This is c urrently:  
 for the living allowance: EUR 4  880 for the researcher per month (person -month)  
To ensure equal treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers, the amount 
for the living allowance is adapted per country, by applying a country -specific 
correction coefficient .  
The coefficient for the researcher is set by the Agency during grant preparation — 
on the basis of the  list of coefficients of the  H2020 Work Programme (section 3  
MSCA ) in force at the time of the call and  according to the country of recruitment  
(i.e. the country of the beneficiary) . 
For GF: there will be two different country -specific correction coefficients:  
 one for the outgoing phase: the coefficient of the country where the 
researcher is hosted (i.e. t he country of the partner organisation)  
 one for the return phase: the coefficient of the country where the 
researcher returns to (i.e. the country of the beneficiary).  
 for the m obility allowance: EUR 600 per person -month  
 for the family allowance: EUR 500  per person -month.  
 
 
 
In practice, the declaration of costs for MSC A grants is very simple and almost completely 
automati zed: The beneficiary must only indicate the number of implemented person -months (for 
the researcher recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the 
IT system.

costs_msca_en.pdf . 
 For the latest information on the amounts and the country correction coefficients,  see the  H2020 
Work Programme (section 3 M SCA) in force at the time of the call. 
 
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the  researcher unit costs (i.e. living, 
mobility and family allowances). They must be fully used for the researcher; they can NOT be used to pay 
other ty pes of costs (see Article 6.2.A(c)) .

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  485 1.3 The costs (in practice for MSC A: the person -months) must f ulfil the following eligibility  
conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
person -months must be linked to the implementation of the action , be incurred during the 
action duration , be identifiable and verifiable , etc.; see Article 6.1 ) 
Costs NOT incurred during the action implementation (e.g. during maternity/parental 
leave)  are ineligible.  
 be incurred for a researcher who :  
 is — at the date of the call deadline — an experienced researcher  (i.e. have a 
doctoral degree OR have at least four years (full time equivalent research 
experience)  of research career ). 
Years of ‘ research career ’ are counted from the date when the researcher 
obtained a degree entitling him/her  to embark on a doctoral programme (either in 
the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited) — even if the 
doctorate was never started or envisaged.  
 is recruited under an employment contract /equivalent direct contract  (i.e. 
other direc t contract with equivalent benefits and social security coverage), 
including :  
 sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits  
 pension rights and  
 benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases  
If national law prevents it from recruiting the researcher under an employment 
contract /equivalent direct contract, the beneficiary may — exceptionally and 
subject to the Agency’s prior agreement  — offer a fixed -amount fellowship  with 
minimum social security coverage, including:  
 sickness , parental and invalidity benefits and  
 benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases . 
In this case, the living allowance will be reduced by 50%.  
The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire action (i.e. also 
during  option al secondments , if any,  and for the  GF outgoing phase).  
For GF: T he third country partner organisation that host s the beneficiary  in the 
GF outgoing phase  can (exceptionally) issue an additional employment contract 
to ensure equivalent coverage during the  stay in the third country.  
Example:  A German university  recruits the fellow for the total duration of the action (i.e. 
provides the main employment contract under the action) and  sends  him/her  to a US 
university. Continuing the German social security during the stay in the US would be so 
expensive, that the beneficiary asks the US partner organisation to conclude an additional 
employment contract, in order to insure the researcher in the US.  
Staff provided by a temporary work agency — The be neficiary must always 
recruit the researcher directly. Recruitments via other means (e.g. temporary work 
agency)  are NOT allowed.  
 as a rule, be employed  full-time  
Part-time employment can be accepted:  
 subje ct to prior approval by the Agency  
 on personal and family grounds  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  486  on professional grounds (except during the outgoing phase for GF) in 
agreement with the beneficiary  
 if limited to a maximum of 50% of the time spent under the action  
Part-time employment for professional reasons can be requested in order to 
pursue supplementary activities , such as creating a company, pursuing another 
research project, engaging in advanced studies not related to the MSCA grant, 
etc. It cannot be requested in order to partic ipate in another MSCA grant at the 
same time.  
When part -time employment for professional reasons is accepted, the 
beneficiary must ensure reliable time records  (e.g. timesheets)  either on 
paper or in a computer -based time recording system.  
In the case of p art-time employment, costs are reported as pro-rata of the full -
time unit cost.  
Example: For one month of 50% part -time employment, 0.5 units should be claimed.  
 
 
 
 work exclusively  on the research training activities  
Work outside the action is NOT allowed  (— unless part -time for professional 
reasons was approved) . Complementary skills training (e.g.  teaching activity  as 
part of the research training ) is possible , but must not jeopardise the research 
activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA ). 
 have been fully incurred  for the benefit of the researcher  (i.e. fully paid to the 
individual  for whom they are claimed ) 
The beneficiary’s costs (gross amount) fo r researcher remuneration, mobility and family 
allowance must be at least as high as the living, mobility and family allowances set out in 
Annex 2. Lower costs are considered as underpayment.  
Social security contributions and taxation (under national law) are to be counted as 
part of the beneficiary’s costs for the recruited researcher (gross amount).  
The mobility and family allowances are due to the researchers for each month worked.  
Mobility  and family  allowances can be paid to the researcher in various ways , for 
example  as: 
 part of his/her salary  
 flight ticket s for private travels , directly purchased or reimbursed by the 
beneficiary ( work-related travel s must  be paid under category B.1 ’research, 
training and networking costs ’) 
 rental costs paid or reimbursed by  the beneficiary , etc. 
Any form is acceptable, provided that:  
-  both sides agree  
 it is allowed under national law    
AND 
 there is no underpayment.  
 If NOT possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons , beneficiaries 
may request a GA suspension  to interrupt  the employment (see Article 49.1.1.2 ).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  487 Example: Researcher X decides to rent an apartment of 750 EUR/month. If the beneficiary is 
willing to sign the rental agreement on behalf of the researcher and the researcher agrees with this 
form of payment, the beneficiary will use 750 EUR of the total amount of 1  100 EUR (mobility & 
family allowance) to pay  the rent. The remaining 350 EUR must be paid as part of the salary (or in 
another acceptable form).  
Example: Researcher Y intends to travel to his/her home country for the summer holidays. S/he 
requests the beneficiary to directly pu rchase the tickets for him/her, and the beneficiary agrees to 
do so. The tickets cost 450 EUR and the beneficiary pays the remaining 150 EUR of the mobility 
allowance as part of the salary (or in another acceptable form).  
 
 
Amounts to be paid in other currencies  must be converted into euro as follows:  
 if a daily rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal  of the European 
Union  for the currency in question:  amounts must be converted into euro at the 
average of the daily exchange rates published over the corresponding reporting 
period, as reported on the ECB website90 
 if no daily rate is published: amounts must be converted at the average of the 
monthly accounting rates over the reporting period, using the currency 
converter  on the Commission’s website91.  
For ease of implementation, the monthly allowances for the recruited researcher 
can be calculated using a conservative exchange rate , if a corrective payment is 
then made (to the rese archer) immediately after the end of the reporting period. 
This must be clearly explained in the employment contract /equivalent direct 
contract  or fixed -amount -fellowship agreement.  
Example:  Researcher X is recruited in a country outside the euro -zone. The  average exchange 
rate is normally EUR  0,9 but this fluctuates from time to time. In order to ensure that the 
fellow receives a regular monthly income and to avoid exchange rate losses, the beneficiary 
chooses to apply a conservative exchange rate of EUR  0,87 and to make a payment to correct 
any underpayment at the end of the reporting period. The fellow is fully informed of this 
procedure at the time of recruitment.

91  Available at http://ec.europa.eu/budget/contracts_grants/info_contracts/inforeuro/inforeuro_en.cfm  
  Usually,  payment as part of the salary is the simplest way to pay these allowances.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Other conditions  — Although NOT formal cost eligi bility conditions for MSCA -IF (because already 
checked by the Agency during the selection procedure ), the recruited researcher must — at the date of the 
call deadline —: 
 comply with the mobility  rule, i.e. not have resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, 
studies, etc.)  in the country of the beneficiary for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately 
before to the call deadline ( — unless the beneficiary is an ‘international European inte rest organisations’ 
or international organisations, for whom the mobility rule is limited to time spent with them) 
Short stays (such as holidays), compulsory national services (such as mandatory military service) and 
procedures for obtaining refugee status  under the Geneva Convention  (1951 Refugee Convention and 
the 1967 Protocol)  are NOT counted.  
For EF Career Restart Panel , Reintegration Panel and Society & Enterprise Panel:  specific mobility rule — not 
more than 3 years in the 5 years immediately before the call deadline  
For GF:  the mobility rule is checked for  the country of the partner organisation, not for the country of the 
beneficiary (i.e. where the outgoing phase takes place, not where the r eturn phase takes place).   
 for GF and EF Reintegration Panel: be nationals or long-term residents  of a EU Member State  or an 
H2020 associated country.  
‘Long -term resident’ means a period of legal and continuous residence in a EU Member States or 
H2020 associated countries for 5 or more consecutive years. Periods outside these countries will be 
taken into account if shorter than 6 consecutive months and all in all not more than 10 months.

MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  488  
The Agency will check if the allowances are u sed fully for the benefit of the researcher. Any 
underpayments, if not corrected, may lead to a rejection of costs for the researcher.  
 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) as follows:  
 for the living allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of months actually spent by the researchers on the research 
activities (‘number of implemented person -months’)  
 for the mobility allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of implemented person -months  
 for the family allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of implemented person -months  
 
 
 
For partial months  of recruitment, a pro -rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day  
(for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days) .  
Example: If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the action , the calculation for the 15 da ys is: 
15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person -months.  
Periods in which a researcher was absent for more than 30 consecutive days  (for reasons other 
than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action (and must be removed from the 
financial statement, by requesting an amendment to suspend the action; see Article 49.1.1.2 ). 
Exampl es:  
1. If the researcher is absent for  30 consecutive days (or less) , the costs incurred during this period can be 
charged to the action . 
2. If the researcher is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more), no costs can be charged for this period 
(from the first day of the absence) and the action must be suspended.  
  The b eneficiary may declare  a maximum  of 24 person -months  for the researcher (or 36 months  for 
GF and EF Career Restart Panel ). Person -months exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency.  
 
 
 
 
 
 For EF Reintegration Panel: The long -term residence requir ement will not apply to researchers who 
have obtain ed refugee status  under the Geneva Convention (1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 
Protocol)  in a EU Member State or H2020 associated country.  
 for EF Career Restart Panel: not have been active  in research for at least 12 months immediately 
before the call deadline  
‘Active in research ’ means being employed or holding a scholarship . Parental leaves and unpaid 
leaves of absence will not be counted as periods of active engagement in research, even if a 
formal employmen t relationship exists during the se period s.  Publication activities or mere 
association to a university are not taken into account  either.   
 for the family allowance: have a family , i.e.  
 persons linked to the researcher by : 
 marriage  or 
 a relationship with equivalent status to marriage (under  the law of the country or 
region in which this relationship was formalised )  
or 
 dependent children who are actually being maintained by the researcher .

1. Institutional costs  (B.1) : Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers :  
 research, training and networking costs  (B.1) — for: 
 costs for training and networking activities that contribute directly to the 
researcher’s career development (e.g. participation in conferences , trips  
related to the work of the action , training , language courses, seminars, la b 
material, books, library records, publication costs )  
 costs for research expenses  
 costs for visa -related fees (even if incurred before the recruitment date) and 
travel expenses  
 additional costs arising from secondments (e.g. travel costs and 
accommodation costs  for optional secondments ) 
 management and indirect92 costs ( B.2) — for the beneficiary’s additional cost s in 
connection with the action . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision  C(201 7) 685593 and set out in 
Annex 2 and 2a of the GA .  
This is c urrently:  
 for research, training and networking costs : EUR 800 for the researcher per month 
(person -month)  
                                            
92  For the definition , see Article 6.2 of the H2020 General MGA : ‘indirect costs ’ are costs that are not directly 
linked to t he action implementation and therefore cannot be attributed directly to it.  
93  Available  at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/unit_costs/unit -
costs_msca_en.pdf  B. Institutional costs  (B.1 Research, training and networking costs and B.2 Management and indirect costs)  
are eligible if the costs for the recruited researcher (living allowance, mobility allowance, family allowance; 
see above) are eligible.  
 
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Budget flexibility  — There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 The institutional unit costs should be shared with entities with a capital or legal link which 
incurred costs for research training activities AND with partner  organisations which incurred costs 
for hosting secondments (including for GF  outgoing phase;  see Article 8 ). 
 The researc h, training and networking unit cost should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -
related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researcher or to organise add itional training 
activities ). 
 The unit cost for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the 
action, but unused amounts may also be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to increase 
the salary of the researcher ).

MSCA IF > Chapter 3 > Article 6.3/6.4  490  for management and indirect costs: EUR 650 per person -month  (if the  beneficiar y  
already receive s an EU/Euratom operating grant94 in the same period : only 
management costs , i.e. EUR 325  — unless they can demonstrate that the operating 
grant does not cover any costs of the action; see Article 6.2.E H2020 General MGA ). 
In practice, the declaration of institutional costs for MSC A grants is completely automatize d 
because the IT system automatically calculates them on the basis of the number of person -
months declared under budget category A ‘ costs for the recruited researcher ’.  
1.3 The eligibility  of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on) the eligibility 
of the costs  for the recruited researcher.  
Institutional costs (research training and networking costs, management and indirect costs) 
are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the recruited researcher are met. Person -
months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for the recruited researcher’ are 
also not eligible for budget category  B ‘institutional costs’.  
Institutional costs can  NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs cannot 
be claimed without living allowance, etc.) . 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for the recruited 
researcher:  
 for the  research, training and networking costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the researcher 
cost) 
 for the management and indirect costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2 )  x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the researcher

94  For the definition , see Article 121(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 : ‘operating grant ’ means 
direct financial contribution, by way of donation, from the budget in order to finance the functioning of a body 
which pursues an aim of general EU interest or has an objective forming part of and supporting EU poli cy. 6.3 Ineligible costs  
‘Ineligible costs’ are:  
(a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1),  in particular costs 
incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49);  
(b) costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency  for 
the purpose of implementing the EU or Euratom budget), in particular, indirect costs if the 
beneficiary is already receiving an  operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the 
same period, unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the 
action.  
(c) [OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme: [insert name of 
excluded cost category] ].  
6.4 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For MSCA actions, t he rules from the General MGA for  third party involvement do NOT apply. 
Instead, MSCA -IF allows the beneficiary to use:  
 entities with a capital or legal link to it  
and 
 partner organisations  
to carry out work under the action ( third parties involved in the action ).  
 
 
 
 
Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost  paid to the beneficiary ; no additional 
costs will be reimbursed  by the Agency . (The beneficiar y is however encouraged to share the unit 
costs received with them. ) 
Entities with a capital or legal link are similar to linked  third parties  under Article 14 of the  
H2020 General MGA  (i.e. entities with a link to the beneficiary , which is neither limited to the 
action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation) . 
Examples (entities with a capital or legal link):  
1. A university is beneficiary of an MSCA -IF grant  (i.e. recruit s the researcher) , but part of the research training 
under the action takes place at its university hospital (which is part of the same structure, but a separate legal 
entity).  ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
- call upon entities with a capital or legal link to the beneficiary5, to implement certain action tasks 
described in Annex 1 (i.e. hosting and training of the researcher ); 
- call upon partner organisations to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e.  hosting 
and training the researcher during secondment).  
In this case, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action . 
 
5 ‘Entities with  a capital or legal  link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular, a legal or capital link, which is 
neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation . 
 
  A beneficia ry using third parties remain s fully responsible  for the m under the GA.  
Best practice:  In order to be  able to fulfil this obligation, the beneficiar y should make  internal arrangements  
(e.g. conclude partnership agreements  with partner organisations ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  492 2. A large multi -national company (which uses a foundation or a subsidiary for all its HR management, including 
concluding the employment contracts and paying the staff) participates in an MSCA -IF action as entity with a 
capital or legal link implementing  research training activities, while the foundation or subsidiary  participates  as 
beneficiary (because it is can recruit the researchers).  
3. A university hospital (which is part of the public health system without legal personality on its own and which 
uses a foundation for its HR management) participates in an MSCA -IF action as en tity with a capital or legal link 
implementing  research training activities, while the foundation participates as beneficiary (because it can recruit 
the researchers).  
Entities with a capital or legal link  may be used for hosting and research training of researchers  
(including during  a secondment) — and can even implement  ALL those activities under the action. 
But they can NOT recruit the researcher (only the beneficiar y can recruit the researcher).  
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
link with the beneficiary and tasks to be carried out) .  
Contrary to linked third parties  under Article 14 of the H2020 General MGA , however,  entities with 
a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
costs paid to the beneficiar y). 
Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
under H2020 as the beneficiary  (for instance, be esta blished in an EU Member State or H2020 
associated country) . 
Example: For the EF Society & Enterprise Panel, the entities with a capital or legal link must also be from the 
non-academic sector.  
 
 
 
Partner organisations  are third parties  involved in the action  without a  (capital or legal) link to 
the beneficiary.  
They may be used to provide training and host researchers , but only  during  a secondment . 
 
Partner organisations can NOT recruit the researcher (only the beneficiar y can recruit the 
researcher).  
For GF: The third country partner organisation that hosts the beneficiary in the GF outgoing 
phase can (exceptionally) issue an additional employment contract to ensure equivalent social 
security coverage during the stay in the third country  (see Article 6 ). 
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular , tasks to be ca rried out) .  
They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
beneficiar y).  
Partner organis ations  for optional secondments must be established in an EU Member State or 
H2020 associated country; partner organi sations for GF outgoing phase must be established in a 
non-associated third country . 
 Secondments — For MSCA -IF, secondments are either:  
 (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation (from an EU Member 
State or H2020 associated country), in order to further enrich the tra ining experience of the 
researcher  
or 
 for GF: (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner organisation (from a third country) . 
Optional secondments  are limited to a maximum of 3 months  (for actions with duration of up to 18 
months) and 6 months  (for actions with duration of more than 18 months).  
The beneficiary remains fully responsible  for the action implementation (in accordance with the GA) also 
during a secondment.

ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For MSC A-IF, simplified rules on record -keeping apply: The beneficiary only needs to keep 
appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person -months declared are correct, i.e.:  
 the employment contract (or other suitable documents, e.g. fixed-fellowship agreement ) 
 proof that:  
 the eligibility conditions for the researc her were complied with (e.g. CV showing the 
researcher’s seniority, copies of diplomas , documents relating to recruitment 
procedure ) 
 the researcher actually worked on the action (e.g. lab books, scientific articles, 
library records)   
 the obligations set ou t in Article 32  were complied with  
 the living, mobility and family allowances (including the employer’s compulsory 
social security payments) were fully paid to the researcher  
 in case of part -time for professional reason s, the work for the action has been 
reliably recorded (through time -sheets, logbooks, counters etc.) . 
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  
It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid ( 3 years for grants up 
to EUR 60  000) or longer if  there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or 
litigation) . In this case , the evidence must be kept until the y end. 
  Costs that are not supported  by appr opriate and sufficient evidence  may be rejected  (and other measures 
described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).  
 Beneficiaries that throw  away supporting documents  will bear the full risk  of cost rejection by the Agency .

1. Access rights for the researcher  
In view of the key role of the recruited researcher in MSC A-IF, the MSC A-IF MGA foresees special 
access rights for him/her  (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25  and 31 H2020 
General MGA ): 
The beneficiar y must give the recruited researcher access  to both background  AND results 
necessary for his/her  research training activities.  
‘Background’ means any data, know -how or information — whatever its form or nature 
(tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
 is held by the beneficiary  before it accede s to the GA  (i.e. before grant signature)  
 is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
AND that  
 has been identified by the beneficiary  in accordance with Article 24.  
‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as da ta, knowledge or 
information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
rights.

1. Recruitment and working conditions — Rights for t he researcher  
In view of the key role of the recruited researcher in MSC A-IF, the MSC A-IF MGA foresees a series 
of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions.  
Main obligations (towards the researcher):  
 Ensure that the researcher enjoys at the place of the implementation at least the same 
standards  and working conditions  as those applicable to local researchers holding a 
similar position  
 Host the researcher at its premises (or at th ose of an entity with a capital or legal link) and 
provide training  as well as the necessary means for implementing the action  (or to ensure 
that this is  provided by the entity with a capital or legal link).  
If the Agency finds that the beneficiary is not sup porting the research training activities in 
line with Annex 1 of the GA, it may reduce the grant.  
 Ensure that the researcher is adequately supervised  
 Ensure that — at the beginning of the research training activities  — a career development 
plan is establis hed and support its implementation  
 Support secondments  of the researcher (if any ) and ensure that they are limited to a 
maximum  of 3 months  (for actions of up to 18 months) or 6 months  (for actions of more 
than 18 months)  
 
 (f) ensure that the researcher does not receive, for activities carried out in the frame of the action, other 
incomes than those received from the beneficiary (or other entity mentioned in Annex 1);  
(g) ensure that the researcher does not have to bear any costs for the implementation of the action as 
described in Annex 1;  
(h) host the researcher at its premises (or at the premises of an entity with a capital  or legal link);  
(i) provide training and the necessary means for implementing the action (or ensure that such training 
and means are provided by entities with a capital or legal link);  
(j) ensure that the researcher is adequately supervised;  
(k) ensure that — at the beginning of the research training activities — a career development plan is 
established together with the supervisor;  
(l) support the secondment  of the researcher to a partner organisation in a Member State or associated 
country as set out in Annex 1:  
- for act ions with a duration up to 18 months: for a maximum of three months or  
- for actions with a duration of more than 18 months: for a maximum of six months;  
(m) [OPTION for GF: support a maximum of 3 months spent by the researcher with the beneficiary (or 
an entity  with a capital or legal link and/or a partner organisation) before the outgoing phase and 
the return of the researcher to the beneficiary (or an entity with a capital or legal link) to carry out 
a mandatory return period of 12 months. ]

For GF: Also support time spent by the researcher with the beneficiary (or an entity with a 
capital or legal link and/or a partner organisation) before the outgoing phase (limited to a 
maximum of 3 months) and the researcher’s return (mandatory return -period  must always 
be 12 months ) 
 Ensure tha t the researcher does NOT receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the 
action ) other incomes  than those received from the beneficiary (or any other entity 
referred to in Annex 1)  
 Ensure that the researcher does NOT have to bear any costs  for the  implementation of the 
action as described in Annex 1  
The recruited researcher must NOT be requested to pay visa -related fees or tuition fees for 
the research training neither from his/her own funds, no r from the researcher unit cost.  
 Comply with the arran gements on intellectual property rights . 
Assistance wi th intellectual property rights can be obtained via the IPR Helpdesk95. 
 Assist  the researcher in the administrative procedures  related to his/her recruitment  
(e.g. helping with visa procedures or preparing the career development plan)   
Assistance with relocating researchers  can be obtained via EURAXESS Services96. 
 Inform  the researcher about key elements of the grant  
Thus, the beneficiary must provide the researcher with information on:  
 basic facts about the Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions , to make the researcher aware 
that s/he is a MSCA fellow , including:  
 the researcher’s rights and obligations and  
 where to look for  details ( MSCA website , Funding & Tenders Portal , Marie 
Curie Alumni Association (MCAA), etc.)  
 the sp ecific action in question (e.g. planned secondments, events, etc.)  and 
 whom they have appointed to supervise him/her for the duration of the research 
training activities, including during optional secondments /GF outgoing phase with 
partner organisations.  
Moreover, the employment contract/equivalent direct contract  (or fixed -amount -fellowship 
agreement) contract must clearly state:  
 the starting date of research training activities under the action and its duration  
The starting date and duration must match those in Article 3 of the GA.  
 the allowances that the researcher is entitled to receive (and if this is paid in a 
currency other than the euro, the exchange rate; for the exchange rate, see 
Article  6).  
The employment co ntract can state the total/annual salary  — as long as it is 
possible to determine the monthly salary (e.g. by dividing the annual salary by 
12).

 Secondments — For MSCA -IF, secondments can be:  
 (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation (from 
an EU Member State or H2020 associated country), in order to further enrich the 
trainin g experience of the researcher  
and/or  
 for GF: (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner organisation (from a third 
country) (see Article 8 )

MSCA IF > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32  498 2. Employment contract — Obligations on the researcher  
The MSC A-IF GA foresees that there must be an employment contract /equivalent  direct contract 
(or fixed -amount -fellowship agreement), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also 
towards  the researcher.  
Main obligations (of the researcher):  
 Work exclusively  on the research training activities  
This also means that a researcher can  NOT hold two MSC A grants at the same time , or 
engage in another professional activity or employment  — unless  part-time employment for 
professional reasons has been approved ( see Article 55 ). Complementary skills training 
(e.g. teaching activity as part of the research training)  is possible , but must NOT jeopardise 
the research activities  (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA) .  
 Not receive (for activities carried out in the fr ame of the action) other incomes  than those 
received from the beneficiary (or any other entity referred to in Annex 1)  
Example:  If the researcher’s allowances fall short of the legal minimum salary in the country in 
question, the beneficiary (or other enti ty in Annex 1) may pay a top -up to make up the difference.  
 Inform  the beneficiary  as soon as possible of any events or circumstances likely to affect 
the GA (such as, significant changes to their career development plan or personal 
circumstances affecting the foreseen activities)  
 Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights  
 Maintain confidentiality  
 Ensure the visibility of EU fundi ng 
The researcher must acknowledge funding under the MSCA  grant in publications, 
communications or patent applications.  
 Complete and submit — at the end of the training — the evaluation questionnaire and — 
two years later — the follow -up questionnaire prov ided by the Agency.

1. Communication activities ( beneficiary ) — Promoting the action — Mainstream 
media coverage  
For MSC A, the rules for promoting the actions are  in principle the same as in the General MGA 
(see Article 38.1. 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, t he beneficiary must inform the Agency not on ly before a communication activity 
expected to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
media coverage  (i.e. coverage in any forms of media , e.g. print, TV, radio and electronic , 
addressing a non -specialist, non -scientific audience , e.g. local, regional or national news ). This ARTICLE 38 — PROMOTING THE ACTION — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
38.1  Communication activities by the beneficiary  
38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results  
The beneficiary must promote the action  and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner.  
This does no t change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply.  
Before engaging in a communication activity expected to have a mainstream media coverag e the 
beneficiary must inform the Agency (see Article 52) .  
38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem  
 
Unless the Agency requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
and major results funded by the grant must:  
 
(a) display the European Union emblem and  
 
(b)  include the following statement:  
 
For communication activities: “This proje ct has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 
research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreement No [number].”  
 
For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part 
of a project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
programme under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreement No [number].”  
 
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
 
For the purposes of its obligations under this Article, the beneficiary may use the EU emblem without first 
obtaining approval from the Agency.  
 
This does not, how ever, give it the right to exclusive use.  
 
Moreover, it may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or 
by any other means.

2. Visibility of EU funding  
For MSCA, the same rules on visib ility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 G eneral MGA ). 
In addition, the MSCA -IF beneficiary (in all actions except MSCA -IF Widening Fellowships ) must 
make specific reference to the MSCA  grant . Thus, the clause acknowledging EU fundi ng is slightly 
adapted.

beneficiar y in MSCA-IF actions may request suspension for professional, personal or family 
grounds of the recruited researcher (including parental leave , long -term sick leave  or another

In this case,  the beneficiary must immediately formally notify suspension to the Agency (see Article 52), 
stating:  
(a) the reasons why and  
(b) the expected date of resumption.  
The suspension will take effect  the day this notification is received by the Agency.  
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the beneficiary must immediately formally notify 
the Agency  and request an amendment  of the Agreement to set the date on which the action will be 
resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other ch anges necessary to adapt the action to the new 
situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has been terminated 
(see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted  with effect from the resumption date set out in the a mendment. This date may 
be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6).  
49.1.1.2 The beneficiary may request suspension of the action implementation (or any part of it) for 
professional, personal or family reasons  (including parental leave).  
For this purpose, the beneficiary must  formally notify a request for amendment  (to make the nec essary 
changes and to set the date of resumption)  in accordance with  Article 55.  
The suspension will take effect  on the date set out in the amendment.  
Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6).

ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Amendments — Additional ground for amendment s: Change to part -time 
employment  (beneficiary)  
What?  For MSC A-IF, the beneficiary may  request an amendment to change the time the 
researcher spends on the action (i. e. from full -time to part -time, part -time to full -time or to a 
different percentage of part -time) — on professional, personal or family grounds (including 
parental leave).   
 
How?  The amendment should be requested immediately  (retroactive change is possible, if 
justified; see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ).  
The action duration  will be automatically adapted  (to extend the action in line with the part -time 
regime, i.e. transform the full -time-equivalent number of months into the real number of months, 
so that the maximum grant amount can stay the same and the costs can be declared at the pro -
rata of the worki ng time ; AT23 clause ) and the reporting periods will be changed ( to adapt them 
to the new action duration ; AT25 clause ). 
 ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS  TO THE AGREEMENT  
55.1 Conditions  
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call 
into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.  
The beneficiary may, in particular, request a change of the time spent on the action  (part -time 
employment) for professional, personal or family reasons (including parental leave).  
[…] 
 For more guidance on amendment s, see the Guide on a mendment types & supporting documents  and the 
Funding & Tenders Portal O nline Manual .   
 
 If NOT possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons , beneficiaries may request 
a GA suspension  to interrupt  the employment (see Article 49.1.1.2 ).

ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT TO A NEW BENEFICIARY  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Transfer of the GA  
MSCA-IF grants can be transferred  to a new beneficiary . 
 
 ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT  TO A NEW BENEFICIARY  
56a.1 Conditions  
The beneficiary may request that the research training activities are transferred to a new beneficiary, if there 
are serious reasons affecting its capacity to implement the action (without being entitled to any additional 
EU funding for doing so) . 
56a.2 Procedure  
The beneficiary must formally notify a request for  amendment to the Agency (see Article 55) . 
The request must include:  
- the reasons why;  
- the date the change takes effect;  
- the opinion of the researcher and its supervisor;  
- a proposal for the necessary  changes, including — if necessary — the appointment of the new 
supervisor and the Accession Form for  the new beneficiary (see Annex 3).  
The change will take effect  on the day set out in the amendment.  
56a.3 Effects  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency , the Agreement will be amended  to introduce the 
necessary changes in order to reallocate the tasks of the former beneficiary (see Article 55).  
In this case, the former beneficiary must : 
- transfer immedi ately the remaining contribution to the new beneficiary and  
- submit — within 30 days from the change — a ‘transfer report ’, containing an overview of the 
progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20) . 
The maximum grant amount  will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary, on the 
basis of the number of actual units in line with Article 6.  
The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements concerning the management of intellectual 
property right s and other issues under the Agreement.  
If the Agency considers that the reasons provided do not justify the transfer, it will reject the request 
specifying the grounds for the rejection.  

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -IF MGA  
MSCA IF > Chapter 7 > Article 56a  505  
 
 
 
The transfer  may be based on  any ground  that is linked to the beneficiary and affect s objectives 
of the action  (i.e. implementing the research training activities ). 
Examples:  Internal reorganisation affecting implementation of the action ; dismantling of the research 
team involved in the action; departure of the supervisor from the beneficiary’s premises; serious conflict 
between the researcher and the supervisor.  
Personal circumstances of the researcher (e.g. other  professional  opportunities , personal or 
family commit ments ) are NOT considered valid grounds for transferring the GA to a new 
beneficiary. These must be addressed by suspending the action (see Article 49.1 ) or a switch 
to part -time employment (see Article 55 ). 
The transfer may NOT entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
award the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.   
Example:  The transfer will not be accepted if  the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility conditions or does 
not have sufficient financial and operational capacity.  
 
2. Procedure  
The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment  to the Agency.   
For the amendment, the rules of the Gene ral MGA apply (see Article 5 5 H2020 General MGA ). 
The transfer date  will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be selected in the amendment request. The ‘transfer date’ should normally be 
the date the researcher starts working with the new beneficiary. In order to allow for full 
synchronisation of dates, chose the entry into force of the amendment (i.e. not a fixed date) 
as transfer date and put this date also as starting date in the employment contract for the 
researcher. If there is a gap in employment (between transfer date and employment starting 
date at the new beneficiary ), request an amendment to suspend the action (AT82; must be 
done before the end of the action) . 
The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
rights and obligations under the Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the Funding 
& Tenders Portal ).  
The maximum grant amount/action duration  will be adapted to take into account the country 
correction coefficient of the new beneficiary.  
 
 
If the new beneficiary is in a country with a lower country correction coefficient, the maximum 
grant amount  (see Article 5.1) will be lowered . 
If the new beneficiary is in a country with a higher country correction coefficient, the action 
duration will normally be adapted, so that the maximum grant amount can stay the same. If 
(exceptionally) the action duration is not changed, the beneficiary mu st top -up the salary of 
the researcher and pay the difference between the former and the new correction coefficient 
(using e.g. the management and indirect costs or own funding) . 
 
 
  Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article 50) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 56).  
NO transfer before the amendment has been accepted by the Agency. Transfers without a formal 
amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible  
until the Agency has approved the amendment.  
  The maximum grant amount (see Article 5)  will NOT be increased .

3. Effects  
The former beneficiary must submit  — within 30  days from the transfer date or the date of 
signature of the amendment, whichever is the latest  — a transfer report, with  information on : 
 the progress and  
 the financial statement (for the open period until transfer).  
This report is for information purposes only. The Agency will use it to check the eligible costs and 
instruct the former beneficiary to transfer  the remaining  pre-financing  to the new beneficiary . 
The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must also be uploaded later on 
with the next periodi c report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement).  
The maximum grant amount will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary 
— on the basis of the researcher months already spent with the former beneficiary.  
The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning  
intellectual property and other issues .

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
1. MSC A-RISE actions  
What?  MSCA-RISE funds : 
 the exchange of staff members (between beneficiaries or between a beneficiary and a 
partner organisation) for research and innovation activities (‘secondments’).  
 
 
MSCA-RISE are multi -beneficiary actions.  
They are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020 -
MSCA -RISE-2014). 
 
 
 For more information  on MSCA -RISE, see the Funding & Tenders Portal O nline Manual  and the H2020 grants 
fact sheets . 
 For more information on the conditions for participation and funding, see the Funding & Tenders Portal 
Online Manual  or the H2020 Work Programme (section 3  MSCA ) and the  call and topics pages  of the call. 
 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled [insert title of the action ] — [insert acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in  Annex 1.  
 Secondments — For MSCA -RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action (see Article 8 ).

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The MSC A-RISE MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the MSC A-RISE MGA:   
 costs for seconded staff members  
 institutio nal costs.  
 
 
 
2. Budget transfers  
The beneficiaries may redistribute person -months between them (as compared with the original 
planning set out in Annex 2) . This redistribution can be done  without requesting an amendment 
(see Article 5 5 H2020 General MGA ) — provided that it does not imply a substantial change to the 
action as described in Annex 1 .  
 
 
Best practice:  The coordinator should inform the Agency in advance of any redistribution of 
person -months, in order to establish if an amendment is needed. Changes that only concern the 
consortium -internal arrangements on the redistribution of the unit costs for management and 
indirect  costs do NOT n eed to be notified to the Agency.  
Example:  Beneficiary A plans to second 24 person -months, but can finally only implement 22. At the same 
time, beneficiary B is able to implement 2 additional person -months compared to the original planning. In 
this case, the budget transfer between the beneficiaries is possible without an amendment.  
A redistribution of person -months will also have an impact on the institutional unit costs (since 
they are also paid according to the person -months declared for seconded staff members).  
Redistributions are subject to the following:  
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The maximum grant amount (see Article 5)  can however NOT be increased .  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken  down by beneficiary and budget 
category  (see Articles 5, 6).  
4.2  Budget transfers  
The estimated budget breakdown indicated in Annex 2 may be adjusted by transfers of amounts between the 
beneficiaries.  
This does not require an amendment according to Article 55, if the action is implemented as described in 
Annex 1.  
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 2 > Article 4  509  no impact on the action as described in Annex 1  
If the transfer of person -months implies a substantial change of Annex 1, a formal 
amendment is required.  
 the minimum and maximum secondment duration.  
Transfers between budget categories  are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories are 
linked to the same  person -months declared for the seconded staff  (and it  is therefore technically 
not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category  to another ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 Redistributions of institutional  unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done via 
an internal agreement.  
 Institutional  unit costs should also be shared with entities with a capital or legal link and partner 
organisations which incurred costs for hosting secondments (see Article 8 ). 
 Research, training and networking unit costs should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -related 
purposes (e.g. to cover travel and subsistence costs of a staff member , to organise additional 
training activities  or horizontal networking events) . 
 Unit costs for m anagement and indirect costs  should be used for the management of the action, but 
unused amounts may also be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to cover travel and 
subsistence costs a staff member , to organise additional training activities  or horizontal networking 
events) .

1. Reimbursement rate  
How much?  For MSC A-RISE, the reimbursement rate is set at 100% (see the H2020 Work 
Programme (section 3  MSCA )). 
 
2. Cost forms  
The MSC A MGAs do not use the cost forms  of the General MGA, but the  unit costs  set out in 
Decision C(201 7) 685597.  
For MSC A-RISE, these are unit costs for: 
 costs for seconded staff members:  top-up allowance  
 institutional costs: r esearch, training and networking costs and management and 
indirect costs.  
These are fixed amounts that must be multiplied by the number of months the staff were 
seconded and spent on resea rch and innovation activities ( person -months); they cannot be 
changed.  
The eligibility conditions are set out in Article 6 .

The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following forms (‘ form of costs ’): 
(a) for costs for seconded staff members : on the basis of the amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 
(‘unit costs ’) and  
(b) for institutional costs (research, training and networking costs, ma nagement and indirect costs): on 
the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs ).

1. Final grant amount  
For MSCA, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since MSC A grants  use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no -profit rule in 
MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).  5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is i mplemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4)  — 
in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate  
Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of  obligations  
5.3.1  Step 1  — Application of the reimbursement rate  
The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by 
the beneficiaries and approved by the Agency (see Article 21).  
5.3.2  Step 2  — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
will be limited to the latter.  
5.3.3 Step 3  — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of  
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by deducting the 
amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or  
breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from th e maximum grant amount set out in Article 
5.1. 
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
- the reduced grant amount following Step 3.

1. Eligible costs  
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs  (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
conditions set out in this Article) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions , applicable per cost form  (for MSC A: only unit 
costs; see Article 5 ).  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category  (see Article 4 ). 
 
2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible  
The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the same as in th e General MGA (see Article 
6.1 H2020 General MGA ).  
 ONLY eligible costs  may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4 ) or declared  
in the financial statements (see Article 20 ). 
Record -keeping & burden of proof  — The burden o f proof  for eligibility is on the beneficiar ies. They 
must keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18 ) to show that the person -months  they declare are 
eligible.   
Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit  by the Commission/Agen cy. Any  
ineligible costs  found will be rejected  (see Article 42 ). 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 General conditions for costs to be  eligible  
Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’), if:  
(i) they are calculated as follows:  
{amounts per unit set out in Annex 2  
multiplied by  
the number of actual units} . 
(ii) the number of actual units complies with the following:  
- the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3;  
- the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and  
- the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
documentation (see Article 1 8).

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category.  
The MSC A MGAs have their own budget categories , with their own types of costs , eligibility  
conditions and calculation rules . 
For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget category 
— the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
 types of costs covered by the budget category  
 cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSC A: unit costs)  
 eligibility conditions  
 how the costs must be calculated.  6.2  Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following two budget categories:

 A. Costs for seconded staff members  are eligible,  if: 
(a) the number of units declared:  
(i) corresponds to the actual number of months spent by the seconded staff members on the 
research and innovation activities and  
(ii) does not exceed 12 m onths (per seconded staff member);  
(b) the seconded staff members comply — at the date of secondment — with the following conditions:  
(i) be one of the following:  
- an ‘early stage researcher ’ (i.e. in the first four years of his/her research career and 
not have a doctoral degree);  
- an ‘experienced researcher ’ (i.e. in possession of a doctoral degree or have at least 
four years of research experience), or  
- administrative, managerial or technical staff  supporting research and innovation 
activities under the action, and  
(ii) have been actively engaged in or linked to research and innovation activities for at least 1 
month at the sending:  
- beneficiary (or entity with a capital or legal link6 to it and located in the same country), 
or 
- partner organisation (or entity with a capital or legal link to it and located in the same 
country).  
(c) the secondments comply with the following conditions:  
(i) last at least 1 month and no longer than 12 months (per secondment);  
(ii) be between different countries;

6  ‘Entities with  a capita l or legal  link’ are entities that  have a link with the beneficiary  or partner organisations , in particular, a legal or 
capital link, which is neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation.  
7 For the definition, see Article 2.1(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 11 December 
2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in “Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and 
Innovation (2014 -2020) ” (‘Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 ’) (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013 p.81):  ‘associated country ’ 
means a third country which is party to an international agreement with the Union, as identified in Article 7 of the H2020 Framewo rk 
Programme Regulation No 1291/2013 . Article 7 sets out the conditions for association of non -EU countries to Horizon 2020.  
8 For secondments for entities with a capital link or legal link to the beneficiaries or partner organisations: only the sector  (academic or 
non-academic) of the beneficiary counts; the entity will be considered to belong to the same sector as their beneficiary.

1. Seconded staff costs  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for the seconded staff members , by providing 
for:  
 a monthly top -up allowance (A) — for travel, accommodation and subsistence costs 
relating to the secondment.   
 
 
 
 
 
What not?  Research, training  and networking  costs and management and indirect costs of the 
beneficiaries are not  covered  under this budget category ; they are covered  under category B 
‘institutional costs’ ( Article 6.2.B ). 
1.2 These costs must be declared  as the unit cost fixed by Decision  C(201 7) 685598 and set out 
in Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
This is currently : 
− for the top -up allowance: EUR 2  100 per seconded staff member per month (person -
month).  
 
 
 
In practice, the declaration of costs for MSC A grants is very simple and almost completely 
automatized : The beneficiaries must only indicate the number of implemented person -months (for 
staff members seconded under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the 
IT system.  
1.3 The costs (in practice for MSC A: the person -months) must ful fil the following eligibility  
conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
person -months must be linked to the implementation of the action , be incurred during the 
action duration , be identifiable and  verifiable , etc.; see Article 6.1 ) 
 be incurred for staff members that — at the date of secondment —:  
 are one of the following three:  
 early stage researcher s (i.e. NOT have a doctoral degree AND be in the first four 
years  (full time equivalent research experience) of their research career )  
 experienced researcher s (i.e. have a doctoral degree OR at least four years (full 
time equivalent research experience)  of research career ), or

costs_msca_en.pdf . 
 For the latest information on the amount,  see the  H2020 Work Programme (section 3  MSCA) in 
force at the time of the call. 
 
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the seconded staff u nit cost s (i.e. top -
up allowance). They must be fully used for the staff member  (to cover the travel, accommodation and 
subsistence costs of the staff member); they can NOT be used to pay other staff members or other types of 
costs (see Article 32 ).  
 Seco ndments — For MSCA -RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action  (see Article 8 ).

H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  516  administrative, managerial or technical staff  supporting research and 
innovation activities  (i.e. actively involved in the R&D activities of the 
organisation and not with a purely administrative role).  
 
Examples (not eligible administrative, managerial or technical staff):  
1. Ms B, employed by beneficiary B as an accountant, is not eligible for secondment as her 
tasks are not directly related to support research and innovation activities.  
2. Mr Y, employed by beneficiary/partner organisation Y and carrying  out secretarial tasks, is 
not eligible for secondment because he is not directly involved in research and innovation 
activities.  
Years of ‘ research career ’ are counted from the date on which the researcher 
obtained the degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme ( either in 
the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited  or from where s/he is 
seconded ) — even if a doctorate was never started or envisaged . 
 have already been actively  engaged in or linked to research and inno vation activities 
at the premises of the sending beneficiary /partner organisation /entity with a capital or 
legal link , continuously for at least 1 month (full time equivalent)  
Example s:  
1. Mr Y is employed  by/has a fellowship with/is a registered PhD candidate of  beneficiary Y as from 
1 January 2014; Mr Y will not be eligible for a secondment from 1 January  2014 but would be 
eligible for secondment as from 1 February  2014.  
2. Ms X is employed 50% part -time by beneficiary X as from 1 January 2014. Ms X will not be 
eligible for a secondment from 1 February  2014, but would be eligible for secondment as from 1 
March  2014. 
The type of relationship  (employment contract, fellowship  or othe r) is NOT relevant  
— as long as  it: 
 complies with national law  
 complies with internal practices and  
 during the secondment: confers to the sending beneficiary/partner 
organisation /entity with a capital or legal link  the necessary legal means in 
terms of controls and instructions to ensure the implementation of the 
activities in line with GA obligations.  
If this is not the case, the beneficiary/partner organisation/entity with a 
capital or legal link must conclude a contract  which allows this  (or a 
supplementary agreement)  — before the secondment.  
Example:  A PhD -candidate can be seconded if s/he: has a contract allowing him/her to 
work full -time on the R&I activities of the action during the secondment under the 
instructions of the sending beneficiary /partner organisation /entity  with a capital or legal 
link. 
 be incurred for secondments :  
 that last at least 1 month  and no longer than 12 months   
Splitting into several periods is allowed.  
Example: If a secondment is split  into two -week periods, the person -month may be claimed (since 
the one -month minimum is satisfied). However, if the staff member participates only in the first 
two-week period and the second one never takes place, the beneficiary may not claim any person -
months for the secondment.  
Best practice:  If the split is not already indicated in Annex 1, the coordinator should 
inform the Agency before the secondment.  
For the minimum duration , only splits within secondment s of same staff,  from same 
sending beneficiary/partner organisation  to same hosting beneficiary/partner 
organisation  can be added . Secondments from/to entities with a capital or legal link 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  517 will be counted as secondments from/to the beneficiaries/partner organisations 
they are linked to.   
Example: Two secondments of two weeks of the same staff member to different beneficiaries 
are not eligible since the minimum duration of 1 month is not reached.  
For the maximum duration, all secondments (and all splits) for the same staff 
member  must be added.  
 that are one of the following three : 
 secondments between beneficiaries /entities with a capital or legal link   
in different EU Member States (or H2020 associated countries) and between 
different sectors, i.e.  academic and non -academic  
Both elements must be fulfilled (i.e. location in different  EU Member States or 
H2020 associated countries  AND different sectors  (academic and non -
academic sector).  
‘Academic sector’ means:  
 public or private higher education establishments awarding 
academic degrees  
 public or private non -profit research organisations for whom one of 
the main objectives is to pursue research or technological 
development  or  
 international European interest organisations.  
‘Non-academic sector’ means any socio -economic ac tor not included in the 
academic sector.  
 secondments from a beneficiary /entity with a capital or legal link  in an 
EU Member State (or H2020 associated country) to a partner 
organisation /entity with a capital or legal link  in a third country   
OR 
 secondments from  a partner organisation /entity with a capital or legal 
link in a third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020  Work 
Programme  to a beneficiary /entity with a capital or legal link  in an EU 
Member State (or H2020 associated country) . 
Secondments from/to branches/departments of beneficiaries/partner organisations 
which are not separate legal entities are NOT eligible , if they are located in 
countries other than the country of their beneficiary/partner organisation.  
Examples:  
A and B exchange staff for 12 months within a RISE project. A sends 10 persons to B for one year 
(i.e. 120 person -months) and B sends the same n umber to A (also 120 person -months).  
Case 1:   A is a beneficiary established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country and B is 
a partner organisation established in a third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020  Work 
Programme.   
A may claim 240  person -months (120 for its own staff and 120 for the staff seconded by the 
partner organisation).  
Case 2:   A is a beneficiary established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country and B is 
a partner organisation established in a th ird country NOT listed in General Annex A to the H2020  
Work Programme.   
A may claim only 120 person -months (for its own staff; the person -months of the staff seconded 
by the partner organisation are not eligible).  
Case 3:   A and B are both beneficiaries established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated 
country.  
They may each claim 120 person -months (for their own staff).  

H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  518 If a person is a staff member of two or more organisations which participate in a 
RISE project, s/he can NOT be seconded from both organisations.  
Example:  A researcher is both professor at the university and CEO of its own SME and both 
organisations are involved in a RISE project. This researcher can only be seconded from one 
of the two organisations.  
By contrast , a staff member can be seconded from one participating 
organisation to two or more participating organisations in a RISE project — as 
long as the total person -months per staff member do not exceed 12 (see also  
Article 19 ).  
 
 
 
 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) as follows:  
 for the top -up allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number  of months actually  spent by the seconded staff members on the 
research and innovation activities (including travel)  (‘implemented person -months’ ) 
 
 
 
For partial months  of recruitment, a pro -rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each 
day (for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days) .  
Example: A staff member is seconded from a beneficiary to a partner organisation from 12 March to 25 
August. The calculation is five months (from 12 March to 11 August) plus 14/30 (for the 14 days from 12 to 
25 Augus t). In thi s case, insert 5.47 as number of person -months.  
 
 
 
 
  Beneficiaries may declare a maximum  of 12 person -months  per seconded staff member.  Person -
months exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency.  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Other conditions  — Although NOT a cost eligibility condition for MSC A-RISE, but an ‘other obligation’ 
under Article 32:   
 the top-up allowance  must be fully used for the staff member  (i.e. fully used to cover the travel, 
accommodation and subsistence costs of the staff member  for whom it is claimed).

1. Institutional costs  (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility  conditions  — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers :  
 research, training and networking costs  (B.1) — for: 
 costs for training, transfer of knowledge and networking activities  
 costs for research expenses  
 management and indirect99 costs (B.2) — for the beneficiary’s additional costs in 
connection with the action.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision  C(201 7) 6855100 and set out 
in Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
This is currently:  
 for research, training and networking costs : EUR 1  800 per researcher per month  
(person -month)  
 for management and indirect costs: EUR 700 per person -month ( for beneficiaries that 
already receive an EU/Euratom operating grant101 in the same period : only 
management costs , i.e. EUR 350  — unless they can demonstrate that the operating 
grant does not cover any costs of the action; see Article 6.2.E H2020 General MGA ). 
                                            
99  For the definition , see Article 6.2 of the H2020 General MGA : ‘indirect costs ’ are costs that are not directly 
linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be attributed directly to it.  
100  Available  at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/unit_costs/unit -
costs_msca_en.pdf . 
101  For the definition, see Article 121(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 : ‘operating grant ’ means 
direct financial contribution, by way of donation , from the budget in order to financ e the functioning of a body 
which pursues an aim of general EU interest or has an objective forming part of and supporting EU policy.  B. Institutional costs  (B.1 Research, training and networking costs and B.2 Management and indirect costs) 
are eligible if the costs for the seconded staff members (see above) are eligible.  
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Budget flexibility  —There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 Redistributions of institutional  unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done 
via an internal agreement.  
 Institutional unit costs should also be shared with entities with a capital or legal link and partner 
organisations which incurred costs for hosting secondments (see Article 8 ). 
 Research, training and networking unit costs should be used for the research, training and 
networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action -
related purposes (e.g. to cover travel and s ubsistence costs of a staff member , to organise 
additional training activities  or horizontal networking events) . 
 Unit costs for m anagement and indirect costs  should be used for the management of the action, 
but unused amounts may also be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to cover travel and 
subsistence costs of a staff member , to organise additional training activities  or horizontal 
networking events ). 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 3 > Article 6.3/6.4  520 In practice the declaration of institutional costs for MSC A grants is completely automatized  
because the IT system automatically calculates them on the basis of the number of person -
months declared under  budget category A ‘ costs for seconded staff  members ’. 
1.3 The eligibility of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on ) the eligibility 
of the costs  for seconded staff  members . 
Institutional costs (research training and networking costs, management and indirect costs) 
are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the seconded staff  members  are met. 
Person -months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for seconded staff  members ’ 
are also not eligible for budget category B ‘institutional costs’.  
Institutional costs can  NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs  cannot 
be claimed without top -up allowance) . 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for seconded staff 
members:  
 for the  research, training and networking costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2 )  x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the seconded staff 
unit cost ) 
 for the management and indirect costs : 
amount per unit (see Annex 2 )  x  number of implemented person -months (declared for the  seconded staff 
unit cost )

 6.3 Ineligible costs  
‘Ineligible costs’ are:  
(a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1), in particular costs 
incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49);  
(b)  costs declared under another EU or Eura tom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency  for 
the purpose of implementing the EU or Euratom budget), in particular, indirect costs if the 
beneficiary is  already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the 
same period, unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the 
action.  
(c) [OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme:  [insert name of 
excluded cost category] ]. 
6.4 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
 Budget flexibility  — Even if the consortium redistributes part s of the institutional unit costs, the reporting 
is always based on the implemented person -months .

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For MSCA actions, t he rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do NOT apply. 
Instead, MSCA -RISE allows the beneficiaries to use:  
 partner organisations  
and 
 entities with a capital or legal link to a beneficiary or a  partner organisation  
to carry out work under the action ( third parties involved in the action ). 
 
 
 
 
Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost  paid to the beneficiaries ; no additional 
costs will be reimbursed  by the Agency . (Beneficiaries are  however  encouraged to share the unit 
costs received with them. )  
Partner organisations  are third parties involved in the action  without a  (capital or legal)  link to 
a beneficiary.   
They may participate in the exchanges by seconding and hosting staff . 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION – THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN 
THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropria te resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- call upon partner organisations to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 
(i.e. seconding and hosting staff);  
- call upon entities with a c apital or legal link to the beneficiaries or to partner organisations9, to 
implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e.  seconding and hosting staff).  
In this case, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementin g the action.  
 
9 ‘Entities with  a capital or legal  link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary or partner organisations, in particular, a legal or 
capital link, which is neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its  implementation.  
 
  Beneficiaries using third parties remain fully responsible  for the m under the GA.  
Best practice:  In order to be  able to fulfil this obligation, beneficiaries should make  internal arrangements  
(e.g. conclude partnership agreements  with partner organisations ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  522  
 
 
 
 
 
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular, tasks to be carried out) .  
They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
beneficiaries).   
Partner organisations must be established in a non-associated third country  (i.e. not EU Member 
State or H2020 associated country) . 
Entities with a capital or legal link  are similar to  linked third parties  under Article 14 of the 
H2020 General MGA  (i.e. entities with a link to a beneficiary or a partner organisation — which is 
neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation).      
They may participate in the exchanges by seconding and hosting staff.   
Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1  (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
the link with the beneficiary/partner organisation and tasks to be carried out ).  
Contrary to l inked third parties  under Article 14 of the  H2020  General MGA , however, entities with 
a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
costs paid to the beneficiaries).  
Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
under H2020 as the beneficiar y/partner organisation  they are linked to  (for instance, if linked to a 
beneficiary: be established in an EU Member State or H2 020 associated country; if linked to a 
partner organisation: be established in a non-associated third country  AND be established  in the 
same country  as their beneficiary/partner organisation .  
Examples (eligible entities with capital or legal link ): 
1.  University X (established in France) is part of a Joint Research Unit (JRU) with beneficiary  Y (also established 
in France). Mr. X is employed by university X and is to be sent on a secondment to beneficiary Z . University X 
will be considered as entity with a capital or legal link  to beneficiary Y and can therefore s econd  Mr. X .  
2. SME X (established in Portugal) is a subsidiary of beneficiary  Y (also established in Portugal). Ms. X is 
employed by SME X and is to be sent on a secondment to partner organ isation  Z. SME X will be considered as 
entity with a capital or legal link  to beneficiary Y and can therefore second Ms. X .  
3. Mr. X is formally employed by foundation X (established in Spain ) which does the HR management for 
beneficiary  Y (also established in Spain ). Mr. X actually works with beneficiary Y and should be sent on a 
secondment to beneficiary Z . Foundation  X will be considered as entity with a capital or legal link to beneficiary 
Y and can therefore se cond Mr. X .   
Examples (ineligible entities with capital or legal link ): 
1. SME X (established in Germany) is a subsidiary of applicant Y (established in Greece). Ms. X is employed by 
SME X and is to be sent on a secondment to partner organisation Z. Since SME X is not established  in the same 
country  as applicant Y, it cannot act as entity with a capital or legal link for the purposes of a MSCA -RISE grant. 
Therefore, Ms X cannot be seconded.  
2. University X (validated as academic ; established in Sweden)  is member of an association of universities 
(applicant  Y; validated as non -academic). Mr.  X is employed by university X and is to be sent on a secondment 
to applicant  Z (validated as academic) . University X cannot act as entity with a capital or legal link of applicant Y 
for the purp oses of the MSCA -RISE grant because this would circumvent the inter -sector mobility rules (mix of 
academic and non -academic) .   
 
 
 
 
 Secondments — For MSCA -RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action. They can be between 
beneficiaries/entities with a capital or legal link OR between beneficiaries/entities with a capital or legal link 
and par tner organisations (from a third country).  
They must have a minimum  duration of 1 month  and a maximum duration of  12 months  (per seconded 
staff member).  
The beneficiaries remain fully responsible  for the action implementation (in accordance with the GA) 
during the secondments.

MSCA RISE > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  523  
Specific cases (third parties involved in the action):  
Authorisation to administer — Coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments 
and coordinators that are public bodies may exceptionally  delegate the administration of  the payments 
to another legal entity (third party ), in most cases a foundation . 
The third party must  fulfil the following conditions:  
 it must have granted an ‘authorisation to administer’  by the coordinator   
AND 
 it must be  affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
affairs, including receiving and administering EU funds.  
 
 
 
 
 
In this case, t he option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisation s to administer must be added to the grant 
agreement.  The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8  must be that of the entity with 
the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
therefore be registered in the Participant Register  and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will  get 
its own PIC — although it is not a beneficiary.  
Since MSCA -RISE uses unit costs, no additional costs arise for the action. The costs of the entity are 
covered by the unit costs paid to the coordinator (see Article 6 ).  
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer  remain fully responsible  for it under 
the GA.

ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For MSC A-RISE, simplified rules on record -keeping apply: Beneficiaries only need to keep 
appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person -months declared are correct, i.e.:  
 proof that:  
 the eligibility conditions for the seconded staff members were complied with (e.g. 
CV showing the researcher’s seniority, copies of diplomas)  
 the secondment was eligible ( e.g. agreement on the secondment; travel documents 
and/or access rights for the host organisation's premises to show the duration; lab 
books, registration documents, scientific articles, library records to show research 
and innovation activities)  
The nature of the records and s upporting documents to be kept by the beneficiary 
must be adequate to show the duration of the secondments clearly and 
unequivocally . 
 the obligations set out in Article 32  were complied with  
Thus for  the obligation to fully use the unit cost for seconded staff member s (to 
cover their travel, accommodation and subsistence costs ): the beneficiaries must 
keep proof of the amounts  paid (e.g. bank transfers to the staff member, travel 
tickets, hotel accommodation, etc.) . 
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  
It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid ( 3 years for grants up 
to EUR 60  000) or longer if  there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or 
litigat ion). In this case , the evidence must be kept until these procedures end. 
 
 
 
Specific case s (record -keeping ): 
Documents for staff of the partner organisations  and entities with a capital or legal link — For 
secondments from partner organisations /entities with a capital or legal link , it is the beneficiary  that 
must keep the documents for the staff of the partner o rganisation /entity with a capital or legal link . 
  Costs that are not supported  by appr opriate and sufficient evidence  may be rejected  (and other measures 
described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).  
 Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents bear the full risk  of cost rejection by the Agency .

ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Deliverable: Progress report  
What & When?  The coordinator must — after each year except if a periodic report is due (i.e. 
normally after the first and third year of the action) — submit to the Agency a progress report, to 
inform it about progress on the action.  
How?  The report must be uploaded  directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal .  
 
2. Deliverable: Mid -term meeting  
What & When?  The coordinator must — before the deadline for the periodic report for RP 1 — 
organise a mid -term meeting .  
Best practice: It is good practice  to send the Agency a draft version of the periodic report (in good 
time before the meeting).  
 
3. Deliverable: Researcher declaration  
What  & When?  The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a ‘researcher declaration’  for each 
seconded staff member — within 20 days from the start of the secondment . 
It is important to give correct and complete information  in the resea rcher de claration , since 
this information will be used to determine the eligibility of the person -months that are 
declared . ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
19.1 Obligation to submit deliverables  
The coordinator must:  
- submit a ‘ progress report ’ within 30 days after the end of each year, except when the periodic and 
final reports are due;  
- organise a ‘ mid-term meeting ’ between the beneficiaries, partner organisations, entities with a 
capital or legal link and the Agency before the deadline for the submission of the report for RP 1 
(reporting period 1);  
- submit any other deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and conditions 
set out in it.  
The beneficiaries must:  
- submit a ‘ researcher  declaration ’ within 20 da ys of the secondment of each seconded staff 
member.  
19.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary or the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the Agency may apply 
any of the measures provided for in Chapter 6.  
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 19  526 If a secondment  is split in several stays of shorter duration, the researcher declaration must 
only be submitted once — at the beginning of the secondment — and indicate each split.  
Example:  Beneficiary A is sending Mr A to partner organisation B for one year, though split in two half -year 
periods. In this case, A ha s to submit the researcher declaration only at the beginning of the first period of 
secondment , indicating the split . No additional declaration is necessary for the second half.  
If a staff member is seconded to more than one beneficiary/partner organisatio n within 
the action duration, several researcher declarations must be submitted (within 20 days from 
the start date of each secondment).  Secondments to entities with a capital or legal link will be 
counted as secondments to the beneficiary/partner organisation they are linked to and must 
therefore be covered by the same researcher declaration.  
Example:  Beneficiary A is sending Mr A to partner organisation B for half a year and to beneficiary C for 
half a year. In this case, the r esearcher declaration has to be submitted twice, each time within 20 days 
from the beginning of the secondment to a different beneficiary/partner organisation.  
How?  The researcher declaration s must be prepared and submitted directly in the  Funding & 
Tenders Portal . 
 
Specific case (deliverables):  
Researcher declaration for staff of the partner organisations  and entities with a capital or 
legal link  — For secondments from partner organisations /entities with a capital or legal link , it is the 
beneficiary that must submit the researcher declaration s.

In view of the key role of the seconded staff members in MSC A-RISE, the MSC A-RISE MGA 
foresees special access rights for them  (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25  
and 31 H2020 General MGA ): 
The beneficiaries must give the seconded staff members access  to both background  AND 
results  necessary for their research and innovation activities.  
‘Background’ means any data, know -how or information — whatever its form or nature 
(tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
 is held by beneficiaries before they accede to the GA  
 is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
AND that  
 has been identified by the beneficiaries in accordance with Article 24.  
‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of th e action, such as data, knowledge or 
information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
rights.

32.1 Obligations towards seconded staff  members  
The beneficiaries must respect the following recruitment and working conditions  for the seconded staff 
member under the action:  
(a) take all measures to implement  the principles set out in the Commission Recommendation on the 
European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers17 
and ensure that the seconded staff members are aware of them;  
(b) ensure that the rights and obligations of the seconded staff members remain unchanged during the 
secondment;

secondment under the action;  
- the righ ts and obligations of the beneficiary toward the seconded staff members under this 
Agreement;  
- the obligation of the seconded staff members to complete and submit — at the end of the 
secondment — the evaluation questionnaire and — two years later — the foll ow-up 
questionnaire provided by the Agency;  
- the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights between the beneficiary and the 
seconded staff members — during implementation of the secondment and afterwards;  
- the obligation of the seconded staff members to maintain confidentiality (see Article 36);  
- the obligation of the seconded staff members to ensure the visibility of EU funding in 
communications or publications and in applications for the protection of results (see

MSCA RISE > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32  529  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Recruitment and working conditions — Rights for the seconded staff members  
In view of the key role of the seconded staff members in MSC A-RISE, the MSC A-RISE MGA 
foresees a series of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions for them.  
Main obligations (towards the staff members):  
 Ensure that the seconded staff members have the relevant expertise  to participate in the 
action  
The p rofiles of the staff to be seconded must be in line with the tasks and objectives 
described in Annex 1.  
 Ensure that the seconded staff members enjoy at least the same standards  and working 
conditions  at the place of secondment as those applicable to person s holding a similar 
position there  
 Ensure that the seconded staff members are covered by an appropriate medical insurance  
scheme  
 Ensure that the staff members are seconded full-time.  
For part-time staff members  this may require a change of their relationship (i.e. 
conclude a contract or a supplementary agreement) , to allow the secondment to be 
implemented on a full -time basis.  
 Ensure that the rights and obligations  remain unchanged  during the secondment  
 
 
 
Beneficiaries and partner organisations must:  
 not penalise the staff members or reduce their rights due to the participation in the 
action and  
 in particular, since their normal remuneration is not covered by the grant (which is 
only a top -up allowance to cover the travel, accommodation and subsistence costs 
of the secondment), continue to pay them as before, accord ing to their internal 
practices.  
Changes in favour of the seconded staff member are of course accepted.  
 Ensure that the seconded staff members are reintegrated  (into the beneficiary/partner 
organisation/entity with a capital or legal link) after the secon dment, so as to allow for a 
transfer of knowledge and maximise the impact of the action (as regards knowledge -sharing 
and long -term collaboration)   
 Comply with the arrangements on intellectual property rights . 
Assistance with intellectual property rights  can be obtained via the IPR Helpdesk102.

 Seco ndments — For MSCA -RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action (see 
Article 8 ).  
 
 
 
 32.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) . 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
17   Commission Recommendation No 251/2005/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct 
for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 2 2.3.2005, p. 67).    
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -RISE MGA  
MSCA RISE > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 32  530  Assist  the seconded staff members in the administrative procedures  related to their 
secondment  (e.g. helping with visa procedures)  
 Inform  the staff member about key elements of the grant  
Beneficiaries must inform seconded staff members of all details concerning the secondment 
and the research and innovation activities (such as description, conditions, location, and 
timetable for implementation) . 
 Ensure that the costs for seconded staff members are fully used for the benefit of the  
seconded staff  members  
They can be:  
 paid directly to the seconded staff member in advance or via different 
instalments or  
 managed centrally by the beneficiary according to the specific  needs of the 
secondment.  
 Ensure that the seconded staff members  do not have to bear  any costs  for the 
implementation of the action as described in Annex 1.  
The seconded  staff members  must NOT be requested to pay tuition fees for their research 
and innovat ion training neither from their own funds, nor from the staff member unit cost.  
 
2. Obligations on the seconded staff members  
Although they do not need to be explicitly reflected in their employment contract  (or fellowship or 
other relationship ), some of the basic obligations under the MSC A-RISE MGA must also be 
respected by the seconded staff members.  
Main obligations (of the staff member):  
 Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights   
 Maintain confidentiality  
 Ensure the visibility of EU funding  
Seconded staff members must acknowledge funding under the MSCA  grant  in publications, 
communications or patent applications.  
 Complete and submit — at the end of the secondment — the evaluation questionnaire and 
— two years later — the follow -up questionnaire provided by the Agency.

1. Communication activities (consortium ) — Promoting the action — Mainstream 
media coverage  
For MSC A, the rules for promoting the action are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 38.1. 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, the b eneficiaries must inform the Agency not only before a communication activity 
expected to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
media coverage  (i.e. coverage in any forms of media , e.g. print, TV, radio and electroni c, 
addressing a non -specialist, non -scientific audience , e.g. local, regional or national news ). This ARTICLE 38 — PROMOTING THE ACTION — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
38.1  Communication activities by the beneficiaries  
38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results  
The beneficiaries must promote the action  and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic a nd effective manner.  
This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply.  
Before engaging in a communication activity expected t o have a mainstream media coverage  the 
beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52) . 
38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem  
Unless the Agency  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
and major results funded by the grant must:  
(a) display the EU e mblem and  
(b) include the following text:  
For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreement No [number]."  
For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie g rant agreement No [number].”  
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
first obtaining approval from  the Agency . 
This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
or by any other means.

2. Visibility of EU funding  
For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1. 2 H2020 General MGA ). 
In addition, the beneficiaries must make specific reference to the MSCA  grant . Thus, the clause 
acknowledging EU funding is slightly adapted.

What?  MSCA-COFUND funds : 
 a regional, national or international doctoral or fellowship training programme for training, 
mobility and career development of researchers ( — implemented by the beneficiary or a 
partner organisation).  
MSCA-COFUND cover doctoral programmes for early -stage researchers (DP) and fellowship 
programmes for experienced researchers (FP).  
MSCA-COFUND are mono -beneficiary actions.  
They are funded under Part I of Horizon 202 0, ‘Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020 -
MSCA -COFUND -2014).

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The MSC A-COFUND MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the MSC A-COFUND MGA:   
 costs for researchers:  
 costs for researchers in programmes implemented by the beneficiary  
 costs of providing financial support to costs for researchers in programmes 
implemented by a partner organisation  
 management costs.  
 
 
 
2. Budget transfers  
Given that MSC A-COFUND is a mono -beneficiary action, there is  NO redistribution of person -
months between beneficiaries . 
Transfers between budget categories  are formally NOT possible because all budget categories are 
linked to the same  person -months declared for the recruited researchers  (and i t is therefore 
technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down for the beneficiary, by budget 
category  (see Articles 5, 6).  
4.2 Budget transfers  
Not applicable  
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 The m anagement unit cost should be shared with partner organisations which incurred costs for the 
implementation of a programme or for hosting secondments  (see Article 8 ). 
 The management unit cost should be used for the management of the action, but unused amou nts 
may also be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of  the researchers ).

The MSC A MGAs do not use the cost forms  of the General MGA, but the unit costs  set out in 
Decision C(201 7) 6855103.  
For MSC A-COFUND, these are unit costs for: 
 costs for researchers:  living allowance  
 management costs.  
These are fixed amounts that must be multiplied by the number of months the recruited 
researchers spent on research training activities (person -months); they cannot be changed.

The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words )]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘ form of costs ’): 
(a) for costs for researchers  in a programme implemented by the beneficiary (living allowance):  
on the basis of the amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (‘unit costs’ ); 
(b) for costs of providing  financial support to costs for researchers in a programme implemented 
by a partner organisation : on the basis of the amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs ) 
and 
(c) for management costs : on the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs ).

1. Final grant amount  
For MSC A, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since MSC A grants use  only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no -profit rule in 
the MSC A MGAs (Step 3 in the Article 5.3 General MGA).  
 
 
 5.3  Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21)  — in 
the following steps:  
Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1  Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by 
the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21).  
5.3.2  Step 2  — Limit to the maximum grant amount  
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
will be limited to the latter.  
5.3.3 Step 3  — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
obligations — Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximu m grant amount by 
deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1.  
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
- the reduced maximum grant amount following Step 3.

1. Eligible costs  
The grant can only reimburse eligible costs  (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
conditions set out in this Article) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions , applicable per cost form  (for MSC A: only unit 
costs; see Article 5 ).  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category  (see Article 4 ). 
 
2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible  
The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
6.1 H2020 General MGA ).  
 
 ONLY eligible costs  may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4 ) or 
declared  in the financial statements (see Article 20 ). 
Record -keeping & burden of proof  — The burden o f proof  for eligibility is on the beneficiar y. It must 
keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18 ) to show that the person -months  it declare s are 
eligible.   
Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit  by the Commission/Agency. Any  
ineligible costs  found will be rejected  (see Article 42 ). 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE  AND INELIGIBLE COSTS   
6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible   
Unit costs are eligible (‘ eligible costs ’), if:  
(a) they are calculated as follows:

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category.  
The MSC A MGAs have their own budget categories , with their own types of costs , eligibility 
conditions and calculation rules . 
For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget category 
— the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
 types of costs covered by the budget category  
 cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSC A: unit costs)  
 eligibility conditions  
 how the costs must be cal culated.  6.2  Specific conditions  for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following two budget categories:

1. Researcher c osts (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs for the researchers (recruited either by the 
beneficiary or by the partner organisation implementing the programme) , by providing for:  
 a monthly living allowance (A.1 or A.2) — to cover the employment or fixed -amount 
fellowship with social security coverage  (i.e. gross amount, including compulsory 
deductions under national law, such as emplo yer/employee social security 
contributions and direct taxes ). 
 
What not?  Other costs of the beneficiary are not covered. Management costs are covered  under 
budget category B ‘management costs’  (see Article 6.2.B ). Other costs (such as mobility and 
family allowances, research, training and networking costs, indirect costs)  are NOT eligible under 
the grant; they may be funded through other  sources (including ot her EU programmes ). 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit costs fixed by Decision  C(201 7) 6855104 and set out 
in Annex 2 and 2a of the GA .  
This is currently:  
− for the living allowance:  
 for early -stage researchers in doctoral programmes: EUR 3 870 per rese archer per 
month  (person -month)   
                                            
104  Available  at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/unit_costs/unit -
costs_msca_en.pdf  A. Costs for researchers  (‘living allowance’)  
A.1 Costs for researchers in a programme implemented by the beneficiary  are eligible, if the number of 
units declared corresponds to the actual number of months spent by the researchers on the research training 
activities and if the conditions set out in Article 15.1.1 are met.  
A.2. Costs of providing financial support to cos ts for researchers in a programme implemented by a 
partner organisation  are eligible, if the number of units declared corresponds to the actual number of 
months spent by the researchers on the research training activities and if the conditions set out in A rticle 
15.1.1 are met.  
 
 Budget flexibility  — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the  researcher unit cost (i.e. living 
allowance). It must be fully used for each researcher; it can NOT be used to pay other researchers or other 
types o f costs (see Article 15 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Combin ing H2020 & other EU grants  — A MSCA -COFUND grant does NOT prevent the beneficiary or 
partner organisations from applying for further  (non-H2020)  EU funding for their programme — for costs 
that are not eligible (or not declared) under the MSCA -COFUND grant.  
 For more information on how to combine EU funding from  different programmes , see the  Funding & 
Tenders Portal O nline Manual  (links to Regional funding).  
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -COFUND MGA 
MSCA COFUND > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  540  for experienced researchers in fellowship programmes:  EUR 5 480 per person -
month.  
 
In practice, the declaration of costs for MSC A grants is very simple and almost completely 
automati zed: The beneficiary must only indicate the number of implemented person -months (for 
researchers recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT 
system.  
1.3 Moreove r, the costs (in practice for MSC A: the person -months) must fulfil the following 
eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
person -months must be  linked to the implementation of the acti on, be incurred during the 
action duration , be identifiable and verifiable , etc.; see Article 6.1 ) 
 fulfil the additional cost eligibility  conditions  set out in Article 15.1.1 . 
1.4 The costs  are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) as follows:  
 for the living allowance:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2)   x  number of months actually  spent by the recruited researchers on the 
research training activities (‘number of implemented person -months’)  
For partial months  of recruitment, a pro-rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day  
(for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days) .  
Example:  If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the project, the calculation for the 15 days is:  
15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person -months.  
Periods in which a researcher was absent  for more than 30 consecutive days (for reasons other 
than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action  (and must be removed from the 
financial statement, by changing the researcher declaration).  
Example s:  
1. If the researcher is absent for 30 consecutive days (or less) , the c osts incurred during this period can be 
charged to the action.  
2. If the researc her is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more) , no costs can be charged for this period 
(from the first day of the absence)  
 
 The unit cost that the beneficiary receives is however EUR 1 935 and EUR 2 740  respectively (because of 
the MSCA COFUND reimbursement rate).   
 For the latest information  on the amount s, see the H2020  Work Programme (section 3  MSCA) in force at 
the time of the call.

1. Management costs  (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions  — 
Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  only the:  
 management costs (B) — for direct costs of managing the action . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What not?  Other costs (such as research, training and networking costs AND indirect costs)  are 
NOT eligible under the grant; they may be funded through OTHER  sources (including other EU 
programmes ). 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit cost fixed by Decision C(201 7) 6855105 and set out in 
Annex 2 and 2a of the GA . 
This is currently:  
− for management costs: EUR 650  per researcher per month  (person -month).  
 
In practice, the declaration of management costs for MSC A-COFUND grants is completely 
automatized  because the IT system automatically calculates them on the basis of the number of 
person -months declared for the researcher cost s.  
1.3 The eligibility  of the management costs is directly linked to (and conditional on ) the eligibility 
of the costs  for researchers.  
Management costs are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the researchers are met. 
Person -months which are not eligi ble for budget category A ‘costs for researchers’ are also not 
eligible for budget category B ‘management costs’.  
Management costs can  NOT be claimed separately (i.e. management costs cannot be claimed 
without living allowance).  
1.4 The costs  are calculate d (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for researchers:

costs_msca_en.pdf . B. Management costs  are eligible if the costs of the researchers (living allowance; see above) are eligible.  
 Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks . 
 Budget flexibility  — There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received:  
 The management unit cost should be shared  with partner organisations which incurred costs for the 
implementation of a programme  or for hosting  secondments  (see Article 8 ). 
 The management unit cost should be used for the management of the action, but unused amounts 
may be used for other action -related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researchers ). 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The unit cost that the beneficiary receives is however EUR 325  (because of the MSCA COFUND 
reimbursement rate).

INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For MSCA actions, the rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do not apply.  
Instead, MSCA -COFUND allows the beneficiary to use:  
 partner organisations  
to carry out work under the action ( third parties involved in the action ).  
 
 
 
Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost  paid to the beneficiary ; no additi onal 
costs will be reimbursed  by the Agency . (The beneficiary is however encouraged to share the unit 
costs received  with them. ) 
Partner organisation s are third parties involved in the action without a  (capital or legal)  link to 
the beneficiary.  
They may be used to : 
 implement a doctoral or fellowship programme (i.e. recruit the researchers)  
 provide training and hosting of researchers during a secondment (see Article 15 ). 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessa ry to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
- call upon partner organisations to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 
(i.e. implementing a doctoral or fellowship programme including recruiting researchers or hosting 
and training research ers during a secondment).  
In this case, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action.  
 
 
  A beneficiar y using third parties remain s fully responsible  for the m under the GA.  
Best practice:  In order to be  able to fulfil this obligation, the beneficiar y should make  internal 
arrangements  (e.g. conclude partnership agreements  with partner organisations ). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement : V5.2 – 26.06.2019  MSCA -COFUND MGA 
MSCA COFUND > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 8  544  
Partner organisations can recruit the researchers (and MUST do so if it is the partner organisation 
that implement s the doctoral or fellowship programme ; see Article 15.1.1(b) ).  
Their involvement must be clearly des cribed in Annex 1  (in particular , tasks to be carried out) . 
They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
beneficiar y).  
Partner organisations that implement a doctoral or fellowship programme must be estab lished in 
an EU Member State, H2020 associated country, or third country listed in General Annex A to the 
H2020  Work Programme . Partner organisations hosting secondments can be established 
anywhere.  
 
 Secondments — For MSCA -COFUND, secondments can be:  
 (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation, in order to further 
enrich the training experience of the researchers  
and/or   
 for fellowship programmes similar to MSCA -IF GF: (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner 
organisation (from a third country).  
The beneficiary remains fully responsible  for the  action  implementation (in accordance with the GA ) 
also during secondment s.

rights und er Article 22 and 23.  
15.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.1, the costs of the researchers will be ineligible 
(see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42).  
If the beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).

researchers.  
The researchers  must — at the date of the call deadline or recruitment —:  
 be one of the following  two: 
 early -stage researchers  (i.e. NOT have a doctoral degree AND be in the first four 
years  (full-time-equivalent research experience) of their research career) or  
 experienced researchers  (i.e. have a doctoral degree OR have at least four years 
(full-time-equivalent research experience)  of research career).  
Years of ‘ research career ’ are counted from the date when the researcher obtained a 
degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme (either in the country in 
which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited ) — even if the doctorate was never 
started or envisaged.  
 comply with the mobility rule , i.e. not have resided or carried out their main activity

 for fellowship programmes similar to MSCA -IF Society and Enterprise Panel, Career 
Restart Panel and Reintegration Panel: 3 years in the 5 years immediately before 
the recruitment date  or call deadline  
 for all other programmes (doctoral programm es and other fellowship programmes): 
12 months in the 3 years immediately before the recruitment date or call deadline  
— unless Annex 1 of the GA specifies otherwise for an already existing programme  or

3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Selection procedure  
The beneficiar y/partner organisation must select researchers in line with  the follow ing criteria:  
 open 
 transparent  
 merit -based  
 impartial  
 equitable  
 described in Annex 1 and  
 for fellowship programmes: based on international peer review.  
For doctoral programmes: the beneficiary /partner organisation must publish vacancies as widely 
as possible  
 at international level and  
 on web -sites requested by the Agency (e.g. on EURAXESS Jobs109).  
Vacancies must i ndicate the minimum gross salary to be offered to the researchers, as set out 
in Annex 1.  
For fellowship programmes: the beneficiary /partner  organisation  must publish calls for proposals 
(with a maximum  of 4 fixed deadlines or regular cut -off dates per yea r) as widely as possible:  
 at international level and  
 on web -sites requested by the Agency (e.g. on EURAXESS Jobs ). 
The calls must indicate the minimum gross salary to be offered to the researchers, as set out i n 
Annex 1.  
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Recruitment and working conditions  
The beneficiary /partner organisation must recruit the researchers under an  employment 
contract /equivalent direct contract  (i.e. other direct contract  with equivalent benefits and 
social security coverage ), including : 
 sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits

MSCA COFUND > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 15  551  pension rights and  
 benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases.  
If national law prevents them from recruiting researchers under an employment 
contract /equivalent direct contract , the beneficiar y/partner organisation may  — exceptionally 
and subject to the Agency’s prior agreement  — offer a  fixed -amount fellowship  with 
minimum social security coverage, including:  
 sickness , parental and invalidity benefits and  
 benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases.  
In this case, the living allowance  will be reduced by 50%.  
The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire recruitment of the researcher 
(i.e. also during secondments, if any).  
Staff provided by a t emporary work agency — The beneficiary/partner organisation must 
always recruit researchers directly. Recruitments via other means (e.g. temporary work 
agency)  are NOT allowed.  
The researchers must be recruited for at least 3 months . 
Researchers recruited under an employment contract /equivalent direct contract  must receive a 
minimum remuneration — monthly living allowance (i.e. gross amount including salary, social 
security contr ibutions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration ) and, if applicable, a 
single mobility allowance for the researcher to take up the doctoral or fellowship programme (to 
be funded through other sources)  — of: 
 for early -stage researchers (doctoral programmes) : EUR 2 7 09  
 for experienced researchers (fellowship programmes): EUR 3  836.  
These amounts are halved  for fixed -amount fellowship agreements  (i.e. for early stage 
researchers EUR 1 354,50; for experienced researchers EUR 1 918). 
Lower  payments are considered as underpayment.  
 
 
 
 
 
The total cost of the doctoral/fellowship programme, in particular the amount s to be provided 
for the benefit of the  researcher s and for the hosting organisation, must be specified in Annex 
1. 
 
A beneficiar y with accounting in a currency other than  the euro must ensure that — by the 
end of the doctoral /fellowship  programme  — the average monthly allowance (over the 
duration of the programme ) respec ts the above -mentioned  minimum . 
Amounts  to be paid in other currencies  must be  converted into euro as follows:  
 if a daily rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European 
Union for the cur rency in question: amounts must be converted into euro at the 
 Since the MSCA -COFUND grant reimburses 50% of the researcher unit cost  (i.e. EUR 1 935 and EUR 2 
740 respectively ), this means that the grant covers only a part of the minimum remuneration. The 
beneficiary must  bear (‘co-fund’) the difference of EUR 7 74 or EUR 1096 per researcher.  
It also means that there can be  NO budget flexibility . The researcher unit cost must have been fully 
incurred for the benefit of the researcher (i.e. fully paid to the individual for whom they are claimed) . There 
can be no amounts left (which the beneficiary could use for other action -related activities).

period , as reported on the ECB website110 
 if no daily rate is published: amounts must be converted at the average of the 
monthly accounting rates over the reporting  period, using the currency converter  
on the Commission’s website111. 
For ease of implementation, monthly allowances for the recruited researchers can be 
calculated using a conservative exchange rate , if a corrective payment is then made (to 
the researchers) immediately after the  end of the reporting period. This must be clearly 
explained in the employment contract/equivalent direct contract or fixed -amount -
fellowship agreement.  
The Agency will check if the living allowance was used fully for the benefit of  the 
researchers. Any un derpayments, if not corrected, may lead to a rejection of costs (for 
that researcher).  
Recruited researchers should not have to bear any costs  for the implementation of the action as 
described in Annex 1.  
For doctoral programmes: recruited researchers must  NOT be requested to pay visa -related 
fees or tuition fees for their research training and/or PhD programme (e.g. student 
registration, access to student services (library, computing, etc.), teaching, supervision, 
examination and graduation)  neither from t heir own funds, nor from the researcher unit cost.  
For fellowship programmes: the recruited researchers must NOT be requested to pay visa -
related fees or tuition fees for their research  training  neither  from their own funds, nor from 
the researcher unit co st. 
 
5. ‘Other obligations’  
In addition to the additional cost eligibility conditions in Article 15.1.1 , the beneficiary/partner 
organisation must comply with the following ‘other obligations ’: 
 the researchers must:  
 be employed full -time, unless duly justified for reasons associated with personal 
or family reasons.  
This also means that a researcher can NOT benefit from two MSC A grants at the 
same time.  
Part-time employment can be accepted:  
 subject to prior approval by  the Agency  
 on personal and family grounds only (i.e. NOT for professional reasons)  and 
 if limited to a maximum of 50% of the time spent under the action.  
In the case of part -time employment, c osts are reported as pro -rata of the full -time 
unit cost.  
Examp le: For one month of 50% part -time employment, 0.5 units should be claimed.

 While it is not possible to request part -time employment for professional reasons , the 
beneficiary may — in exceptional cases — request an  interruption of the employment. If the 
Agency agrees (beforehand and in writing), there is no need for an amendment or GA 
suspension; it is sufficient NOT to declare the months not worked.

1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For MSC A-COFUND, simplified rules on record -keeping apply: The bene ficiary only needs to keep 
appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person -months declared are correct, i.e.:  
 the employment contracts (or other suitable documents, e.g. fixed-fellowship 
agreements ) 
 proof that:  
 the eligibility conditions for t he researchers were complied with (e.g. CV showing 
the researchers’ seniority, copies of diplomas , documents relating to selection  
procedure ) 
 the researchers actually worked on the project (e.g. lab books, scientific articles, 
library records)   
 the obligations set out in Article 15  were complied with  
 the minimum remuneration  was paid to the researchers.  
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  
It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid ( 3 years for grants  up 
to EUR 60  000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or 
litigation) . In this case , the evidence must be kept until the y end. 
 
 
Specific case (record -keeping):  
Documents for a programme implemented by a partner organisation  — For a programme 
implemented by a partner organisation, it is the beneficiary that must keep the documents also for the 
partner organisation.  
  Costs that are not supported by appr opriate and sufficient evidence  may be rejected  (and other measures 
described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).  
 Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents bear the full risk of cost rejection by the Agency .

What & When?  The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a researcher declaration for each 
recruited researcher  — within 20 days of the start of the research training activities of the 
researcher.  
It is important to give correct and complete information in the researcher declaration since the 
data will be automatically transmitted to Annex 4 (financial statement), for calculating the 
living allowance units.  If the researcher declaration is not provided, it will NOT be possible to 
declare person -months for that researcher . 
How?  The researcher declaration s must be prepared and submitted directly in  the Funding & 
Tenders Portal . 
 
2. Deliverable: Mid -term meeting  
What  & When ? The beneficiary must  organise a mid -term meeting  with the Agency  to present 
the implementation of the action in the light of the schedule in Annex 1.  
Best practice: Please contact the Agency for the timing . ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
19.1  Obligation to submit deliverables  
The beneficiary must  
- submit a ‘ researcher declaration ’ within 20 days of the start of the research training activities, for 
each researcher;  
- organise a 'mid -term meeting'  with the Agency;  
- submit any other deliverables  identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and conditions

1. Access rights for the researcher  
In view of the key r ole of the recruited researcher s in MSCA -COFUND , the MSCA -COFUND MGA 
foresees special access rights for them (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25  
and 31 H2020 General MGA ): 
The beneficiary must give the recruited researcher s access  to both background  AND results 
necessary for their research training activities.  
‘Background’ means any data, know -how or information — whatever its form or nature 
(tangible or intangible), including a ny rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
 is held by the beneficiary before it accedes to the GA (i.e. before grant signature)  
 is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
AND that  
 has been identified by the beneficiary in accorda nce with Article 24.  
‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
generated in the action as well as any rights attach ed to it, including intellectual property 
rights.  
The b eneficiary must moreover ensure that partner organisations  (if any) give similar access.

Article 38.1. 1 H2020 General  MGA). 
However, t he beneficiary must inform the Agency not only before a communication activity 
expected to have a major  media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
media coverage (i.e. coverage in any forms of media , e.g. print, TV, radio and electronic , ARTICLE 38 — PROMOTING THE ACTION — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
38.1  Communication activities by the beneficiary  
38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results  
The beneficiary must promote the action  and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner.  
This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
or the security o bligations in Article 37, all of which still apply.  
Before engaging in a communication activity expected to have a mainstream media coverage  the 
beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52) . 
38.1.2  Information on EU funding — Obligation and right  to use the EU emblem  
Unless the Agency  requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
and major results fun ded by the grant must:  
(a) display the EU emblem and  
(b) include the following text:  
For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant ag reement No [number]."  
For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
under th e Marie Skłodowska -Curie grant agreement No [number].”  
When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
first obtaining approval from the Agency . 
This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
or by any other means.

1. Linked grant  
MSCA -SNLS  grants are  always linked to another MSCA grant of the beneficiary (main grant – IF, 
ITN, RISE or Cofund).   
The MSCA -SNLS provides support only to researchers or staff members with disabilities who are 
eligible under the linked  MSCA GA . 
Moreover, the MSCA -SNLS grant shares the fate of the main grant (e.g. if the main grant is 
suspended or terminated, the MSCA -SNLS grant may also be suspended or terminated ; see 
Articles 49.2  and 50.3).

2. Action: MSCA -SNLS  
What?  MSCA -SNLS grants fund additional costs that MSCA researchers and staff members with 
disabilities face due to the inc reased costs of their mobility  during another MSCA action (main 
grant) .  
MSCA -SNLS is awarded for the acquisition of special needs items or services  (e.g. assistance by 
third persons, adaptation of work environment, additional travel/transportation costs) to allow the 
recruited  or seconded researcher /staff member to participate in the main MSCA action . 
What not?  Additional costs entailed  by the recruited  or seconded researcher /staff member  but 
already covered by a nother source (e.g. social security or healt h insurance)  cannot be funded 
under the MSCA -SNLS . 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
The grant is awarded for the acquisition of the special needs items or services described in Annex 1, which 
are needed to allow the concerned resear cher or staff member to participate in the linked grant (‘ action ’).

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS  
 
 
1. Estimated lump sum breakdown  
Since MSCA -SNLS grants do not use eligible costs, the MSCA -SNLS MGA does not have any  budget 
categories . Instead, it has either a single lump sum or, if several special needs items or services  
are needed, a lump sum breakdown .  
For technical reasons, each item or service must be considered a separate  work package.  
The breakdown is used to  determine : 
 the share of the lump sum to which the beneficiary is entitled for each work package.  
 the maximum amount of grant reduction that can be applied for improper implementation 
of a work package.  
Example: Annex 2 sets out EUR 10 000 for work package 1 (WP1) – Special assistance services for the 
entire action duration (12 months). The Agency carries out a review on the grant and concludes that WP1 
was not properly implemented because only part of the activities of that work package were actually car ried 
out (i.e. assistance was provided for 11 months instead of 12 months). The Agency will reduce the grant in 
proportion to the improper implementation of WP1 up to a maximum of EUR 10 000  (the share of the lump 
sum allocated to that work package ).  
 
2. Lump sum share transfers  
Given that MSCA -SNLS is a mono -beneficiary action, there is NO redistribution between 
beneficiaries .  
Transfers between work packages  are NOT possible , because the lump sum shares have been 
fixed for each special needs item or service . ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated lump sum breakdown  
The ‘ estimated lump sum breakdown ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the lump sum shares, per work package (i.e. special needs items or services).  
The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
beneficiary. It shows the a mounts that the Agency commits to pay if the action is implemented properly, 
regardless of the costs actually incurred.  
4.2 Lump sum share transfers  
The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 cannot be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
work  packages (not even via an amendment; see Article 55).

ARTICLE 5  — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
 
 
1. Grant amount and form of grant  
How much & which form? The MSCA -SNLS MGA does not use the cost forms  of the General 
MGA, but is a lump sum grant .  
The use of the lump sum is set out in the H2020 Work Programme  (section 3  MSCA ).  
The lump sum will be fixed taking into account the H2020 MSCA funding rates . This means 
that the lump sum fixed in Article 5 does not have to be multiplied again by the funding rate ; 
it is already the net maximum EU funding.  
The lump sum  is one amount for the entire action. It will be limited to a maximum of EUR 
60 000 per researcher/staff member and will be available as of 2019.  
There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is correctly implemented , the beneficiary is 
entitled to receive th e lump sum fixed in the GA .

The grant takes the form  of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action.  
 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs and cannot be increased.

1. Final grant amount  
For MSCA -SNLS grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same as for  the 
General MGA (see Article 5.3  H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21 ). 
Moreover, since they are lump sum grants (and the amou nt declared cannot be higher than the 
amount fixed in Annex 2  anyways ), there is NO  need to calculate the : 
 limit to the maximum grant amount or  
 reduction due to the no -profit rule.  
 5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘ final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in 
the following steps:  
Step 1  — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of non -
approved work packages  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1 Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of 
non-approved work packages  
The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
beneficiary are added together.  
The grant is reduced (see Article 43) fo r all other work packages (i.e. all work packages that have not been 
delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance).  
5.3.2 Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations — Reduced gran t amount — Calculation  
If the grant is further reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations other than improper implementation; see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant 
amount by deductin g the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1.  
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
­ the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
­ the reduced grant amount following Step 2.

1. Revised final grant amount  
For MSCA -SNLS grants , the rules on the revised final grant amount are also in principle the same 
as for  the General MGA  (see Article 5. 4 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21 ). 5.4  Revised final grant amount — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 22) — the Agency reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
breach of obligations including improper implementation); see Article 43), it will calculate the ‘ revised 
final grant amount ’. 
This amount is calculated by the Agency by reducing the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fr aud or breach of obligations (see Article 43.2).

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Third parties involved in the action  
For MSCA -SNLS actions, NEITHER  the rules from the General MGA NOR from the MSCA main grant 
for third party involvement apply.  
There are NO special rules  for purchases or subcontracting. The b eneficiar y may make purchases 
or subcontract tasks if this is needed for the  special needs items or services . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
- purchase goods, works and services ;  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
in accordance with the specific rules set out in Article 10 to 14a.  
In these cases, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action.  
  For all  types of third party involvement (purchases and/or  subcontracts ), the costs  are ALL covered  by 
the lump sum.  NO other costs will be reimbursed.

ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORD S — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For MSCA -SNLS actions, the beneficiary does not need to keep full records on its actual costs ; it  
only need s to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation, records) that the special 
needs item s or service s were provided to the researcher /staff member as described in Annex 1 .  
The records and supporting documentation must also prove that :  
 the eligib ility conditions for the researcher/staff member as per MSCA main grant were 
complied with  
 the special need(s) of the researcher/staff member was certified by a competent national 
authority.  
By contra st, timesheets or invoices are NOT  needed.  The evidence must be verifiable, auditable 
and available.  It must be correctly archived — for at least 3 years (because not above 60 000 
EUR) after the balance is paid or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, 
investigations or litigation) . In this case , the evidence must be kept until they end.  
 
 ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
The beneficiary must — for a period of three years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate 
records and other supporting do cumentation  to prove the proper implementation of the action.  
It must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
investigations (see Article 22).  
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investi gations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiary must keep the records and 
other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiary must kee p the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The Agency may accept non -original 
documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance.  
Recor ds and other supporting documentation on the implementation of the action must be in line with the 
accepted standards in the respective filed.  
The beneficiary does not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the action.  
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action , the grant may be 
reduced  (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

ARTICLE 20 — REPORTING — PAYMENT REQUESTS  
20.1 Obligation to submit reports  
The beneficiary must submit to the Agency (see Article 52) the technical and financial reports set out in 
this Article. These reports include the request for payment and must be drawn up using the forms and 
templates provided in the electronic exchange sys tem (see Article 52).  
20.2 Reporting period  
The action has one reporting period:  
- RP1: from month 1 to month [X]  
20.3 Periodic  reports — Requests for interim payments  
Not applicable  
20.4 Final report — Request for payment of the balance  
The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days following the end of the reporting period — a final report.  
The final report must include the following:  
(a) a ‘ final technical report ’ containing:  
(i) an overview of the results .  
This report must include explanations justifying the differences between work expected to be 
carried out in accordance with Annex 1 and that actually carried out.  
(ii) a summary  for publication by the Agency: not applicable;  
(iii) the answers  to the ‘ questionnaire ’: not applicable;  
(b) a ‘ final financial report ’ containing a ‘ financial statement ’ (see Annex 4) which       includes the 
request for payment of the balance .  
The financial statement must declare the lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2, for  the work 
packages that were completed.  
If agreed by the Agency, the beneficiary may exceptionally also declare work packages that were not 
completed.  
Lump sum shares which are not declared in the financial statement will not be taken into account by 
the Agency.  
The beneficiary must certify  that:  
- the information provided is full, reliable and true;   
- the work packages have been completed and that the action in general has been properly 
implemented (see Article 7);

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  568  
 
1. Reports  
What & When?  For MSCA -SNLS actions, the beneficiary must submit a final periodic  report  at 
the end of the action.  
Each report is composed of a technical and  a financial report , however, the financial report is not 
to declare costs but completed work packages  and corresponding lump sum shares (one or more , 
depending on the number of special needs items or services which are covered by the grant ). 
In principle, lump sum sh ares should be claimed only for special needs items and services that 
were fully provided to the researcher/staff member concerned. However , if agreed by the Agency, 
the beneficiary may exceptionally declare partial lump sum shares for work packages that w ere 
not completed, for example,  due to technical reasons or reasons related to the researcher/staff 
member.  
Best practice:  In case of doubt, the beneficiary should contact the Agency about partial work 
packages.  
 
 
 
 
 
 The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if:  
 the situation could have been solved  via an amendment.  
Example:  The beneficiary argues that it did not have enough time to complete the WP. The duration of 
the action could have been extended via an amendment for the beneficiary to have enough time.  
 non-implementation linked to financial reasons  
Example:  The special n eeds service turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned.  - the proper implementation can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting 
documentation (see Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the 
context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 22).

ARTICLE  21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments to be made  
The following payments will be made to the beneficiary:  
- one pre-financing payment ;  
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
20).  
21.2 Pre -financing payment — Amount — Amoun t retained for the Guarantee Fund  
[OPTION 1 by default: The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The amount of the pre -financing payment will be EUR [ insert amount (insert amount in words) ]. 
The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre -financing payment to the beneficiary within 
30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 days before the 
starti ng date of the action (see Article 3) whichever is the latest.  
An amount of EUR [ insert amount (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency from the pre -financing payment and trans ferred into the 
‘Guarantee Fund ’.] 
[OPTION 2 if the JRC is the beneficiary: The Agency will make a pre -financing payment of EUR [ insert 
amount including the 5% to be paid to the Guarantee Fund (insert amount in words) ], within 30 days 
from the submission of a debit note from the JRC after the signature of the ‘Arrangement’.  
The JRC agrees that the amount of EUR [ insert amount: 5% of the grant amount intended for the JRC 
(insert amount in words) ], corresponding to its contribution to the Guarantee Fund (see Article 21.2), is 
transferred in its name by the Agency to the Guarantee Fund. ]  
21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
Not applicable  
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the 
action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency will pay the 
balance within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articl es 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the final report and the lump sum shares and work packages declared. 
Their approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of 
their content.

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  570  
 
1. Payments to be made  
MSCA -SNLS actions have only one reporting period (see Article 20.2 ), with one pre -financing 
payment.  
There are NO interim payments.  
The balance is paid when the action ends.  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
Payment of the balance  
How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
be calculated by the A gency on the basis of the financial statement, the final grant amount and 
the payments already made.  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.3 , 21.4 and 44.1.2 H2020 General MGA ), 
however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs, but simply sums up all the lump sum shares  for the accepted work packages. Partial 
work packages can exceptionally be accepted (i.e. shares for work packages that were not Incomplete work packages, and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be approved will 
reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).  
The amount due as the balance is calculated by the Agency by deducting  the total amount of pre -financing 
already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
pre-financing made }.  
At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarante e Fund (see above) will be released and:  
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the beneficiary together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary  
- is negative, it will be recovered .  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any other 
amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the EU 
or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount  indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated lump 
sum breakdown (see Annex 2).

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  571 completed, for example due to technical reasons  or reasons related to the researcher/staff 
member ). 
Example s:  
1. The beneficiary of an ongoing MSCA -SNLS GA cannot complete the pending work packages because the 
person providing assistance to the MSCA -RISE staff member with special mobility needs is no longer able to 
provide the service and the staff member in question doe s not want to replace his/her assistant. Therefore, the 
beneficiary requests termination of the MSCA -SNLS GA. The Agency decides to accept part of the lump sum 
shares for the uncompleted work packages that is proportionate to the tasks already carried out under the 
MSCA -SNLS action.  
2. The participation of an early -stage researcher (ESR) with physical impairment has been terminated in the 
linked MSCA -ITN GA due to personal circumstances of the researcher (e.g. another professional opportunity). 
Given that the grounds for termination of the MSCA -SNLS are not linked to  the beneficiary, the Agency decides 
to exceptionally accept partial work packages that were initiated but could not be fully completed. The Agency 
will however verify if the reported lump sum shares for the uncompleted work packages are proportionate to t he 
tasks carried out.  
 
Steps 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
do not apply to MSCA -SNLS  grants.  
Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other  than non -implementation 
(because non -implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
All other steps follow the General MGA.  
 
Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount  
The amount to be recovered (or paid) after the final payment will be calculated by the Agency on 
the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount.  
The rules foll ow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.4  and 44.1.3 H2020 General MGA ), 
however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Re -calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply; o nly Step 4 (Grant 
reductions) applies.  
All other steps follow the General MGA.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if:  
 the situation could have been solved  via an amendment.  
Example:  The beneficiary argues that it did not have enough time to complete the WP. The duration of 
the action could have been extended via an amendment for the beneficiary to have enough time.  
 non-implementation linked to financial reasons  
Example:  The special n eeds service  turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned.

OF FINDINGS  
 
 
1. Checks, reviews and audits  
The rules on checks, reviews and audits are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 22 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since MSCA -SNLS grants do not use eligible costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
 there w ill be no financial  checks, reviews, or audits to check costs (since the beneficiary 
has no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action, even if they remain 
subject to the accounting rules under the applicable national law).  
 checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the technical  implementation of the action (in 
particular whether the special needs items and services  have been provided to the 
researcher/staff member as described in Annex 1 of the GA).  
Specific cases (audits):  
Audits for perio dical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Commission/Agency may also 
audit the accounting records of the beneficiar y to obtain general information about real costs of cost 
items for which it has fixed unit costs, flat -rate or lump sums (for statistic al purposes or to gather data 
to assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for 
the beneficiar y.

44.1 Amount to be recovered — Calculation — Procedure  
The Agency will — at the payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any amount that was 
paid, but is not due under the Agreement.  
44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participat ion  
Not applicable  
44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
notify a ‘ pre-information letter ’ to the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to r ecover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
- specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund; and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund, if the difference is positive or  
- formally notify to the beneficiary a debit note for the difference between the amount to be 
recovered and the amount ret ained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative . This note 
will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
the amount:  
(a) by offsetti ng it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the 
beneficiary by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the  Agency or the Commission 
may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will formally notify the 
beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the am ount:  
(i) not applicable;  
(ii) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article

date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment of 
the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charg es and late -payment interest and then against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC12 applies.  
44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If, the revised fi nal grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the beneficiary must 
repay the difference to the Agency .  
The Agency will formally notify a pre-information letter to the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the du e amount and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received, it will confirm the amount t o be recovered and formally notify to the beneficiary a debit note .

The MSCA -SNLS MGA has, however, the following specificities : 
 
Since  there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could be doubts, the suspension 
ground for MSCA -SNLS grants targets more generally any kinds of doubts about the amounts 
requested for payment (including doubts linked to work package implementation) .  
 SECTION 3 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION  
ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
47.1 Conditions  
The Agency may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 21.4) if a request 
for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:  
(a) it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Article 20);  
(b) the technical or fina ncial report has not been submitted or is not complete or additional information 
is needed, or  
(c) there is doubt about the amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) 
and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are n ecessary.  
47.2 Procedure  
The Agency will formally notify the beneficiary of the suspension and the reasons why.  
The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the Agency (see Article 52).  
If the conditions for suspending the payment de adline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
and the remaining period will resume.  
If the suspension exceeds two months, the beneficiary may request the Agency if the suspension will 
continue.  
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to  the non -compliance of the technical or financial report 
(see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, 
the Agency may also terminate the Agreement (see Article 50.3.1(l)).

ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
 
 ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiary  
49.1.1 Conditions  
The beneficiary may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
— in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementati on impossible or excessively difficult.  
49.1.2 Procedure  
The beneficiary must immediately formally notify to the Agency the suspension (see Article 52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the expected date of resumption.  
The suspension will take effect the d ay this notification is received by the Agency.  
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the beneficiary must immediately formally notify 
the Agency and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which the action will be 
resume d, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new 
situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement has been terminated (see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
work packages may be started.  
49.2 Suspension of the ac tion implementation, by the Agency  
49.2.1 Conditions  
The Agency may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if:  
(a) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed or is suspected of having committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreem ent or during the award procedure (including 
improper implementation of the action, submission of  false information, failure to provide 
required information, breach of ethical principles);  
(b) the beneficiary or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — 
systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant  (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 
22.5.2);

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49  578  
 
1. GA suspension  (consortium or EU)  
The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 49  H2020 
General MGA ).  
For full GA suspension  (action is entirely suspended ), all on -going work packages  (i.e. special 
needs items or services)  must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.  
For partial  GA suspensions  (suspension of specific work package(s)), , other  work packages may be 
continued and new work packages may be started.   
 
 
 (c) not applicable;  
(d) the action implementation of the linked grant (see Article 2) is suspended.  
49.2.2 Procedure  
Before suspending implementation of the action, the Agency w ill formally notify the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the Agency does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the observations it 
has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the suspension. Otherwise, it will formally notify that 
the procedure is not continued.  
The su spension will take effect five days after confirmation notification is received by the beneficiary (or 
on a later date specified in the notification).  
It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met.  
The beneficiary w ill be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be amended to set the date 
on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to 
adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement has already been terminated 
(see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date may 
be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
During the suspension , no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
work packages may be started.  
The beneficiary may not claim damages due to suspension by the Agency (see Article 46).  
Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the Agency’s right to terminate the Agreement (see 
Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly paid (see Articles 43 and 44).

MSCA SNLS >  Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49  579 2. GA suspension — Additional ground for suspension: Suspension of main grant 
(EU) 
In addition to the normal grounds for GA suspension (see Article 49 H2020 General MGA ), the 
Agency may suspend the MSCA -SNLS action if the main grant (to which the MSCA -SNLS grant is 
linked ) is suspended.   
Example: The benefic iary of an ongoing MSCA -IF grant  has requested GA suspension for family grounds of the 
recruited researcher with visual impairment. The beneficiary has already fully adapted the main work 
environment but the adaptation of a small laboratory is still missin g. The Agency will suspend the MSCA -SNLS 
GA until the MSCA -IF action will be resumed.

ARTICLE 50 — TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT   
50.1 Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiary  
[…] 
50.1.2 Effects  
The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
Article 20).  
If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no lump sum shares will be taken 
into account.  
The Agency will  calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21) on the 
basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only lump sum 
shares for work packages fully completed before termination w ill be accepted — unless exceptionally 
agreed otherwise by the Agency.  
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
After termination, the beneficiary's obligations (in particular Article 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 43 and 44) 
continue to apply.  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
Not applicable  
50.3 Termination of the Agreement, by the Agency  
50.3.1 Conditions  
The Agency may terminate the Agreement if:  
(a) not applicable;  
(b) a change to the beneficiary’s legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation is 
likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or calls into question the 
decision to award the grant;  
(c) not applicable;  
(d) implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
beneficiary (see Article 49.1) and either:  
(i) resumption is impossible, or  
(ii) the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the 
grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;  
(e) the beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the cou rts, 
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law;  
(f) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means;

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50  581  
 
1. GA termination  
The rules on GA termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 50 H2020 
General MGA ). 
However,  since for MSCA -SNLS  grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different 
(see Article 21 ). 
 
2. GA termination — Additional ground for termination: Termination  of main grant 
or researcher/staff member's participation in main grant (EU) 
In addition to the normal grounds for GA termination (see Article 50.3 H2020 General MGA ), the 
Agency may terminate the MSCA -SNLS action if the main grant  or the researcher/staff member's 
participation in the main grant (to which the MSCA -SNLS grant is linked) is terminated . 
Example:  The beneficiary of MSCA -COFUND grant has committed substantial errors and irregularities and the 
Agency has decided to terminate the GA. The MSCA -COFUND GA is linked to MSCA -SNLS GA which foresees the 
construction of multiple ramps at the premises of the beneficiary to create an accessible work environment. The 
termination of the MSCA -COFUND GA serves as a ground for termination of the MSCA -SNLS GA by the Agency.  
 If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no lump sum shares will be taken 
into account.   
The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21) on the 
basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only lump sum 
shares for work packages fully completed bef ore termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally 
agreed otherwise by the Agency.  
This does not affect the Agency’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative 
sanctions (Article 45).  
The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency (see Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 43 and 44) 
continue to apply.

ARTICLE  55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT  
 
 
1. Amendments  
The rules for amendments are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 55 H2020 General 
MGA). 
Given the parallelism of the MSCA -SNLS grants and the main grant, there may be a need to 
amend both in a synchronised manner.  
Example:  If the time spent by the researcher or staff member on the linked MSCA action is changed (e.g. for 
MSCA -IF from full -time to part -time), the duration of the MSCA -SNLS action may also have to be adapte d 
accordingly.  
MSCA SNLS > Chapter 7 > Article 56a  ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT  
55.1 Condit ions  
The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would 
call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
Amendments may be requested by any of the pa rties.  
55.2 Procedure  
The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed in the electronic exchange 
system (see Article 52).  
The request for amendment must include:  
- the reasons why;  
- the appropriate supporting documents, and  
The Agency may request additional information.  
If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the electronic exchange system 
within 45 days of receiving notification (or any additional information the Agency has requested). If it  does 
not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, 
if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request 
is considered to have been rej ected.  
An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.  
An amendment takes effect on the date agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, on 
the date on which the amendment enters into force.

 ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT TO A NEW BENEFICIARY  
56a.1 Conditions  
If the linked grant (see Article 1) is transferred to a new beneficiary, the beneficiary may also request the 
transfer of this action.  
56a.2 Procedure  
The beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment to the Agency (see Article 55).  
The request must include:  
- the reasons why;   
- the date the change takes effect;  
- the opinion of the researcher or staff member;  
- a proposal for the necessary changes, including the Accession Form for the new beneficiary (see 
Annex 3).  
The change will take effect on the day set out in the amendment.  
56a.3 Effects  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the 
necessary changes (see Article 55).  
In this case, the former beneficiary must:  
- transfer immediately the remaining contribution to the new be neficiary and  
- submit — within 30 days from the change — a ‘transfer report ’, containing an overview of the 
progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20).  
The lump sum will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary, on the basis of the part 
performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining part to be given by the new beneficiary. If the pre -
financing received by the former beneficia ry (see Article 21) exceeds the amount of the lump sum 
recalculated for the former beneficiary, the Agency will request the former beneficiary to transfer to the new 
beneficiary any part of the pre -financing received in excess.  
Where necessary, the former  and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements concerning the transfer of 
any equipment, materials and/or services purchased and used for the researcher or staff member concerned. 
The former beneficiary may object only on the basis that the transfer i s technically not possible or not 
possible under national law.  
If the Agency considers that the reasons provided do not justify the transfer, it will reject the request 
specifying the grounds for the rejection.

MSCA SNLS > Chapter 7 > Article 56a  584 
 
1. Transfer of the GA  
MSCA -SNLS grant can be transferred  to a new beneficiary if the main grant (MSCA -IF, MSCA -
ITN, MSCA -RISE or MSCA -COFUND)  is transferred to it.  
Transfer of the main grant agreement may cover:  
- 'transfer' in the sense of Article 56a MSCA -IF MGA  
- change of beneficiary due to 'partial takeover'  
- addition of a new beneficiary  to the main grant , which will host the researcher/staff 
member with special needs .  
 
 
 
 
The transfer may NOT  entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
award the MSCA -SNLS  grant .  
Example:  The transfer will not be accepted if the special needs item or service is eligible for funding by another 
source in the country of the new benefic iary (e.g. social security or health insurance system).  
 
2. Procedure  
The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment to the Agency.  
For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 Gener al MGA ).  
The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
The date must be selected in the amendment request. The transfer date must be the same 
date as the accession date of the new beneficiary. Retroactive dates are allowed, but only 
in exceptional cases and with a specific justification (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ).  
The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
rights and obligations under the GA) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the Funding & 
Tenders  Portal ).  
 
 
 
3. Effects  
The former beneficiary must submit — within 30 days from the transfer date — a transfer report, 
with information on:  
 the progress of the work and  
 the financial statement (for the open period until transfer).  
  Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
beneficiary — without passing via termination ( Article 50 ) or addition of a new beneficiary ( Article 56 ).  
NO transfer bef ore the amendment has been accepted by the Agency. Transfers without a formal 
amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible 
until the Agency has approved the amendment.

new beneficiary.  
The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must be also uploaded w ith the 
final report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement).  
The lump sum will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary — on the basis 
of the part performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining par t to be given to the new 
beneficiary. If the pre -financing received by the former beneficiary (see Article 21 ) exceeds the 
amount of the lump sum recalculated for the former beneficiary, the Agency will request the 
former beneficiary to transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre -financing received in 
excess.  
The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning 
the transfer of the equipment, materials and/or services purchased for the researcher/staff

IV. SME Instrument  MGAs  
IV.1 Background information and approach  
The SME Instrument Model Grant Agreements are used for SME Instrument actions only , i.e.:  
 SME Ph1  Lump Sum  
 SME Ph2.  
The SME Instrument MGAs follow the General MGA for numbering and content, except for:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The annotations will concentrate on differences in substance and interpretation that require 
explanation.  
Parts that do not appl y or differ only in presentation (e.g. Articles 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 23a - 33, 
37, 39  H2020 SME Ph1 Lump Sum MGA , Annexes) will not be shown.  
By contrast, provisions that do not deviate from the General MGA, but that require clarification 
or a specific explanation or interpretation for SME Instrument actions are added:  
for SME Ph1  Lump Sum : 
 Article 2 ( SME Ph1 actions ) 
 Article 8 ( SME Ph1 rules on third party involvement ) 
For SME Ph2:  
 Article 2 ( SME Ph2 actions ) 
 Article 4.1 ( SME Ph2 budget categories ) The H2020 SME Ph2 MGA deviates from the General MGA as follows:  
 Article 5.2 (SME Ph2 specific provisions on reimbursement rate)  
 Article 13 (SME Ph2 specific provisions on subcontracting)  
 Article 26.3 (SME Ph2 ownership of results, rights of third parties)  The H2020 SME Ph1  Lump Sum  MGA deviates from the General MGA as follows:  
 Article 4 (estimated budget of the action)  
 Article 5 (maximum grant amount, form of grant and reimbursement rate)  
 Article 6 (lump sum specific form of costs)  
 Article 7 (specific provision for SME Ph1)

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. SME Instrument Ph1  Lump Sum  actions  
What?  SME Instrument Ph1 Lump Sum funds : 
 the feasibility study for an innovation idea (i.e. a ‘proof of concept’ or ‘business plan’ for 
new, altered or improved product, process or service) . 
The feasibility study of Phase 1 should cover all topics that are necessary to assess quality and 
potential of the innovation idea (e.g. risk assessment, market study, user involvement, intellectual 
property management, innovation strategy development, par tner search, feasibility of concept 
etc.). 
The innovation  idea must have commercial potential and considerable novelty for its sector 
(i.e. for technological innovation ideas: ‘technology readiness level’ of 6 or above ; see General 
Annex G to the H2020 Work Programme ). 
The implementation in Phase 2 must then focus on innovation activities (e.g. demonstration, 
testing, prototy ping, piloting, scaling -up, miniaturisation, design, market replication)  but may also 
include some research.  
If provided for in the w ork p rogramme/call, an SME Instrument Ph2 action may exceptionally 
concern pre -dominantly research  activities. In this cas e, it will be funded with a GA based on 
the General MGA (instead of the SME Instrument Ph2 MGA).  
SME actions are normally mono -beneficiary actions , but can also be multi -beneficiary.  
SME actions are funded under Part II of H orizon 2020, ‘Innovation in SMEs’ ( e.g. H2020 -SMEINST -
01-2016-2017).

The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
It contains the budget category, the estimated eligible costs and the form of costs (see Articles 5 and 6).  
4.2 Budget transfers  
Not applicable  
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article

http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/legal/unit_cos ts/unit -costs_sme -ph1_en.pdf .  ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT, FORM OF GRANT, REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND FORM 
OF COSTS  
5.1 Maximum grant amount  
The maximum  grant amount  is EUR 50  000 (fifty thousand euros).  
5.2 Form of grant, reimbursement rate  and form of costs  
The grant reimburses 70  % of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs 
grant ’) (see Annex 2).  
The estimated elig ible costs of the action are EUR 71  429 (seventy one thousand four hundred and twenty 
nine).   
Eligible costs (see Article 6) for the costs for the feasibility study must be declared as the lump sum set out 
in Annex 2 (i.e. under the form of ‘lump sum cost s’). 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL  (direct and indirect) costs  that are incurred for the feasibility 
study.  NO other  costs will be reimbursed.

1. Final grant amount  
For SME Ph1 grants, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the 
same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared is pre -filled by the system), 
there is NO need to calculate the : 
 limit to the maximum grant amount or  
 reduction due to the no -profit rule.  5.3  Final grant amount — Calculation  
The final grant amount depends on the proper implementation of the action in accordance with the 
Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
This amount is calculated by the Agency  — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in 
the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs  
The reimburse ment rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (lump sum costs; see Article 6) 
declared by the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21).  
5.3.2 Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious bre ach of 
obligations — Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximum grant amount by 
deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the  errors, 
irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1.  
In this case, the final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained in Step 1 or  
- the amount obtained in Step 2.

1. Revised final grant amount  
For SME Ph1 grants, the rules on the calculation of the revised final grant amount are in principle 
the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, for SME Ph1  Lump Sum grants, improper implementation of the action leads to 
ineligibility  of the costs (NOT to grant  reduction ). Therefore, t he grant  reduction  mentioned in this 
provision does not relate to improper implementat ion of the action  (but only to other breaches and 
substantial errors, irregularities and fraud ; see Article 43 ).  
 5.4  Revised final grant amount — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 22) — the Agency  rejects costs (see Article 42) or reduces the grant (see Article 43), it will  calculate 
the ‘revised final grant amount ’.  
This amount  is calculated by the Agency  on the basis of the findings , as follows:  
- in case of rejection of costs : by applying the reimbursement rate to the revised eligible costs 
approved by the Agency ; 
- in case of reduction of the grant : in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
fraud or  breach of obligations (see Article 43.2).   
In case of rejection of costs and reduction  of the grant , the revised final grant amount will be the l ower of 
the two amounts above.

ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Eligible costs  
The SME Ph1 MGA has its own budget category , with its own types of costs , eligibility 
conditions and calculation rules . 
 
2. Costs for the feasibility study  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility 
conditions — Calculation  
2.1 What?  The budget category A ‘costs for the feasibility study’ covers  the (direct and indirect 
costs) for  the feasibility study for the innovation idea (see Article 2 ). 
 
 
 
2.2 These costs must be declared as  the amount  fixed by Decision  C(2013)  8198114 and 
indicated  in Annex 2 of the GA ( currently EUR 71  429 per action).  
 
 
 
In practice , the declaration of costs for SME Ph1 grants is completely automatized . The 
coordinator only need s to sign and submit the financial statement (pre -filled by the IT system).  
2.3 They must fulfil the following eligibility conditions : 
 the action tasks must have been carried out as described in Annex 1.  
2.4 NO calculation  is necessary  (since it is a fixed global amount).  
By signing the financial statement (for multi -beneficiary actions: one common financial statement 
for the consortium; see Article 20 ), the beneficiaries automatically declare the am ount of EUR 
71 429 as the total eligible costs of the action (the amount is fixed and pre-filled by the IT 
system).

ph1_en.pdf . ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND  INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 Eligible costs  
Costs for the budget category:  
A. Costs for the feasibility study (direct and indirect costs)   
are eligible (‘eligible costs’), if they correspond to the lump sum set out in Annex 2 and if the corresponding 
tasks or parts of the action have been properly implemented in accordance with Annex 1.  
 Since SME Ph1  grants have a reimburse ment rate of 70% , the lump sum that the beneficiaries 
receive is EUR 50 000 .  
 
 
 
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL  (direct and indirect) costs  that are incurred for the feasibility 
study.  NO other  costs will be reimbursed.

 6.2 Ineligible costs  
‘Ineligible costs’ are:  
(a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out  above (see Article 6.1) and  
(b) costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency  
for the purpose of implementing the EU and  Euratom budget.  
[(c) OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme: [insert name of 
excluded cost category ]].  
6.3 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .

ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Consequences of improper implementation  
For SME Ph1 Lump Sum grant s, ‘improper implementation of the action not in accordance with 
Annex 1’ does NOT lead to grant  reduction , but to the ineligibility  of the costs ( see Article 6 .1). 
 
 
 
 
 
By contrast, in case of other serious breaches  the grant may be reduced  (see Article 43 ). 
 If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, costs will be rejected  proportionally to the 
tasks or parts of the action not implemented (see Article 42 ).  
If the feasibility study is incomplete and thus does not meet the intended objective or is of insufficient 
quality (e.g. does not permit to assess the quality and potential of the innovation idea) , ALL costs will 
be declared ineligible and there will be NO  EU financial contribution  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  
7.1  General obligation to properly implement the action  
The beneficiary must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions 
of the Agreement and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and nation al law.  
7.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary does not properly implement the action (or part of it),  the corresponding costs will be 
ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
If the beneficiary breaches any other obligation, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) . 
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable  to the SME Ph1 
Lump Sum MGA . 
The special rules from the General MGA on t hird party involvement are limited  in SME Ph1 actions  
to purchases ( Article 10 ) and subcontracting ( Article 13 ). 
 
 
 
In-kind contributions (Articles 11  and 12) and linked third parties (Article 14 ) or international 
partners ( Article 14a ) are NOT allowed  (since it is a very simple action and moreover targeted at 
SMEs, the Agency expects the beneficiaries to implement the main part of the work — without 
relying on third part ies). 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10) and  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13).  
In these cases, the beneficiary retains sol e responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action.  
 
  The costs of purchases  and subcontracts are ALL covered  by the lump sum.  NO other  costs will be 
reimbursed.

1. Purchase of goods, works or services  
The rules on contracts for the purchase of goods, works or services for SME Ph1 actions are in 
principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 10 H2020 General MGA ). 
Since SMEs are , by definition,  not ‘contracting authorities ’, there is however NO obligation as 
regards compliance with the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU , 2014/25/EU115 or 
2009/81/EC  and the  national legislation implementing them.  
Moreover, the obligations in Article 10.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility 
conditions, but ‘other obligations’ . In case of breach, t he Commission/Agency may therefore 
reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (inst ead of rejecting the costs).

10.1  Rules for purchasing goods, works or services  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may purchase goods, works or services.  
The beneficiary must make such purchases ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest 
price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of intere sts (see Article 35).  
The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards its 
contractors.  
10.2  Conseq uences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

The rules on subcontracting for SME Ph1 actions are in principle the same as for  the General MGA 
(see Article s 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The SME Ph1 MGA has however the following specificities : 
Subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action.   
Moreover, the estimated subcontracting costs do NOT have to be included in Annex 1  or shown in 
the table of estimated costs of Annex 2 (since they are covered by the lump sum).  
Since SMEs are not contracting authorities, there is also NO obligation as rega rds compliance with 
the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU , 2014/25/EU116 or 2009/81/EC  and the national 
legislation implementing them.

13.1 Rules for subcontracting  action tasks  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may award subcontracts covering the implementation 
of certain action tasks described in Annex 1.  
The beneficiary must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
lowest  price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Artic les 22 and 23 also towards its 
subcontractors.  
The beneficiary must ensure that its obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
subcontractors.  
13.2  Consequences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under  this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For SME Ph1 actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep full records on their actual costs; they only 
need to keep the evidence (documentation, records) that the action tasks (as described in Annex 
1) were properly carried out.  
Examples:  Evidence means documentation that proves that the tasks were carried out. Describing all the tasks 
relating to the feasibility study is usually enough.   
 ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation to support the costs declared  
The beneficiary must — for a period of three years after the balance is paid — keep adequate records and 
other supporting documentation  to prove that the corresponding tasks or part of the action as described in 
Annex 1 have been implemented properly.  The beneficiary does not ne ed to identify the actual eligible 
costs covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount 
declared as the lump sum.  
It must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, review s, audits or 
investigations (see Article 22).  
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiary must keep the rec ords and 
other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiary must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The Agency  may ac cept non -original 
documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance  
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be 
ineligible (se e Article 6) and will be  rejected (see Article 42).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .

 MONO -BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments to be made    
The following payments will be made to the beneficiary:  
- one pre-financing payment ; 
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
20). 
21.2  Pre-financing payment  — Amount  — Amount reta ined for the Guarantee Fund  
The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The amount of the pre -financing payment will be EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ].  
The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre -financing payment to the beneficiary 
within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 days before the 
starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest.  
An amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency  from the pre -financing payment and transferred into  the 
‘Guarantee Fund ’ 
21.3 Interim payments  — Amount — Calculation  
Not applicable  
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary 
for the implementation of the action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency  will pay the balance 
within 90 days  from  receiving the final report (see Article 20.4) , except if Articl es 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the final report.  Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the Agency by ded ucting the total amount of pre -financing 
already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
pre-financing made}.

21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarant ee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiaries 
for the implementation of the action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency  will pay the 
balance within 90 days  from  receiving the final report (see Article 20.4) , except if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the final report.  Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, authenticit y, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the Agency by deducting the total amount of pre -
financing already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount  (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
pre-financing made }. 
 
 
 At the payment of the balance, the amount  retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
and: 
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the beneficiary together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taki ng the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary  
- is negative, it will be recovered.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent —  against any other 
amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum EU contribution indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated 
budget (see Annex 2).  
21.5 Notification of amounts due  
The Agency will formally notify to the beneficiary the amount due and specify the final grant amount.  
In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded  by the 
contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.

1. Payments to be made — No interim payments  
SME Ph1 actions have only one reporting period (see Article 20.2 ), with one pre -financing 
payment.  
There are NO interim payments.  
The balance is paid when the action ends.  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amount s due  — Recoveries?  
Pre-financing payment  
How much? The pre -financing payment for SME Ph1 actions is up to 50% of the maximum grant 
amount (i.e. up to EUR 25  000).  
 
Payment of the balance  
How much? The amount of the payment of the balance  depends on the overall financial situation 
of the action, after calculation of the final grant amount (see Article 5.3 ). At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released and:  
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the coordinator  together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator  
- is negative, it will be recovered from the coordinator.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the coordinator’s consent —  against any other 
amount owed by the coordinator to the Agency , the Commission or an [other]  executive ag ency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1.

BENEFICIARIES  — RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTNERS OF A JOINT ACTION  
41.1 Roles and responsibilities towards the Agency     
The beneficiaries have full responsibility for implementing the action and complying with the Agreement.  
The beneficiaries are jointly and severally liable for the technical implementation  of the action as described 
in Annex 1. If a beneficiary fails to i mplement its part of the action, the other beneficiaries become 
responsible for implementing this part (without being entitled to any additional EU funding for doing so), 
unless the Agency  expressly relieves them of this obligation.  
The financial responsi bility  of each beneficiary is governed by Articles 44, 45 and 46.   
41.2 Internal division of roles and responsibilities  
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:  
(a) Each beneficiary  must:  
(i) keep information stored  in the Participant Portal Beneficiary Register (via the electronic 
exchange system) up to date (see Article 17);

1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the Agency  
The rules on internal division of roles and responsibilities  are similar to the General MGA (see 
Article 4 1 H2020 General MGA ). 
Since for SME Ph1  multi-beneficiary actions  there is however only one (common) financial 
statement (see Article 20 ), there is NO obligation  for the beneficiar ies to submit the ir own  
individual financial statement s to the coordinator .  (iii) inform the coordinator immediately of any events or circumstances likely to affect significantly 
or delay the implementation of  the action (see Article 17);  
(iv) submit  to the coordinator in good time:  
- the data needed to draw up the technical report (see Article 20);  
- ethics committee opinions and notifications or authorisations for activities raising ethical 
issues (see Article 34);  
- any other documents or information required by the Agency  or the Commission under the 
Agreement, unless the Agreement requires the beneficiary to submit this information 
directly to the Agency or the  Commission.  
(b)  The coordinator  must:  
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7);  
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the beneficiaries and the Agency  (in 
particular, providing the  Agency  with the information described in Article 17), unless the 
Agreement specifies other wise;  
(iii) request and review any documents or information required by the Agency  and verify their 
completeness and correctness before passing them on to the Agency ;  
(iv) submit the deliverables and the report to the Agency  (see Articles 19 and 20);  
(v) ensure that all payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see 
Article 21);  
(vi) inform the Agency  of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, when required under the 
Agreement (see Articles 44 and 50) or requested by the Agency .  
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above -mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary 
or third party.  
[OPTION  to be used  when the coordinator is a secondary or higher education establishment or 
public body and there is an ‘authorisation to administer’ given to a third party created, controlled 
or affiliated to the coordinator: As an exception,  the coordinator delegates the t asks set out in Point

1. Reject ion of ineligible costs  
The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 4 2 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, s ince for SME Ph1 Lump Sum grant s the main cost eligibility condition refers to ‘proper 
implementation of the action  in accordance with Annex 1 ’ (see Article 6.1), improper 
implementation  leads to the ineligibility  of the costs ( NOT grant reduction ; see also Article 7 ). If 
the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, the costs will be considered ineligible and 
rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented.   
 
 
If the feasibility study is incomplete and thus does not meet the intended objective or is of 
insufficient quality (e.g. does not permit to assess the quality and potential of the  innovation 
idea), ALL costs will be declared ineligible and there will be NO  EU financial contribution.  
  Cost rejections will be made for improper implementation  of the action  (see Article 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 42 — REJECTION OF INELIGIBLE COSTS  
42.1 Conditions  
The Agency  will —at the payment of the balance or afterwards  — reject any costs which  are ineligible 
(i.e. if the action as described in Annex 1 is not properly implemented; see Article 6), in particular following 
checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 22).  
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from o ther grants to this grant (see Article 
22.5.2).  
42.2 Ineligible costs to be rejected  — Calculation  — Procedure  
Ineligible costs will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented . 
If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery (see Article 44), the Agency  will formally notify the 
beneficiary of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the reasons why (if applicable, together with the 
notification of amounts due; see Article 21 .5). The beneficiary may — within 30 days of receiving 
notification — formally notify the  Agency  of its disagreement and the reasons why.  
If the rejection of costs leads to a recovery , the Agency will follow the contradictory procedure with ‘ pre-
information letter ’ set out in Article 44.  
42.3 Effects  
If the Agency rejects costs at the  payment of the balance , it will deduct them from the total eligible costs 
declared, for the action, in the financial statement (see Article 20.4). It will then c alculate the payment of the 
balance as set out in Article 21.4.    
If the Agency  rejects costs after the payment of the balance , it will deduct the amount rejected from the 
total eligible costs declared, in the financial statement. It will then calculate t he revised final grant amount 
as set out in Article 5.4.

1. Reduction of the grant   
The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 4 2 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, s ince for SME Ph1 Lump Sum grant s ‘proper implementation  of the action in accordance 
with A nnex 1’ is an eligibility  rule and  does NOT lead to the reduction  of the grant  (see also 
Article s 6.1 and 7), the grant can be reduced only in case of other serious breaches of obligations 
or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud ; see Article 4 3 H2020 General MGA ). 
 
   Grant reductions  will be made  for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  and serious breach es 
of obligation  other than proper implementation . 
 
. 
 ARTICLE 43 — REDUCTION OF THE GRANT  
43.1 Conditions  
The Agency may — at the payment of the balance or afterwards  — reduce the maximum grant amount 
(see Article 5.1), if:  
(a) the beneficiary (or natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under th e Agreement or during the award procedure 
(including submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach 
of ethical principles) or  
(b) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its beha lf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions  — 
systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant ( extension of findings from other gra nts to this grant ; see Article 
22.5.2).  
Improper implementation of the action as described in Annex 1 will not lead to a reduction of the grant but 
to a rejection of costs (see Article 42).   
43.2 Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure  
The amount of  the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
breach of obligations.  
Before reduction of the grant, the Agency  will formally notify a ‘ pre-information letter ’ to the 
beneficiary:  
- informing it of its int ention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons why 
and 
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the Agency does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the obs ervations it 
has received, it will formally notify confirmation  of the reduction (if applicable, together with the 
notification of amounts due; see Article 21).  
43.3 Effects  
If the Agency reduces the grant at the time of  the payment of the balance , it will calculate the reduced 
grant amount for the action and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see Articles 
5.3.4  and 21.4) . 
If the Agency reduces the grant after the payment of the balance , it will calculate the revised final gra nt 
amount (see Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency 
will recover the difference (see Article 44 ).

44.1 Amount to be recovered — Calculation  — Procedure  
The Agency will — at the  payment of the balance  or afterwards  — claim back any amount that was paid, 
but is not due under the Agreement.  
44.1.1  Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation  
Not applicable  
44.1.2   Recovery at pa yment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
notify a ‘pre-information letter ’ to the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
- specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund; and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the Age ncy decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received , it will confirm recovery  (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund,  if the difference is positive  or 
- formally notify to the beneficiary a debit note  for the difference between the amount to be 
recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative . This note 
will also specif y the terms and the date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will  recover  
the amount:  
(a) by offsetting it — without the beneficiary’s consent —  against any amounts owed to the 
beneficiar y by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the Agency or the 
Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit not e; 
(b) by drawing on  the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will  formally notify the 
beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:  
(i) not applicable;  
(ii) by taking legal action  (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision  under 
Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)   and Article 79(2) of the 
Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
increa sed by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the payment 
date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment of 
the amount.

applies.  
44.1.3  Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the beneficiary must 
repay the difference to the Agency.  
The Agency will formally notify a pre-information letter to the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.

If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency  will formally notify 
a ‘pre-information letter ’ to the coordinator :  
- informing it of its intention to recover, th e amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
- specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund and  
- inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the Agency  decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received , it will confirm recovery  (together with the notif ication of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund,  if the difference is positive  or 
- formally notify to the coordinator a debit note  for the difference between  the amount to be 
recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative . This note 
will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If the coordinator does not repay the Agency  by the date in the debit note, the Agen cy or the Commission 
will recover  the amount:  
(a) by offsetting it — without the coordinator’s consent —  against any amounts owed to the 
coordinator by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
budget).  
In exceptional cir cumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the Agency  may offset 
before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) by drawing on  the Guarantee Fund. The Agency  or the Commission will  formally notify the 
coordinator the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:  
(i) not applicable ; 
(ii) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision  under  
Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 79(2) of the 
Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the payment 
date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment of 
the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expense s, charges and late -payment interest and then against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the coordinator, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC applies.  
44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If the revised  final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the coordinator must 
repay the difference to the Agency .

1. Recovery of undue amounts  
The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA  (see 
Article 4 4 H2020 General MGA ). 
The SME Ph1 multi -beneficiary MGA has, however, the following  specificities : 
Since  the coordinator  alone  is financially responsible (for the entire grant) , the Agency will recover  
ONLY  from it. 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should  foresee internal arrangements to redistribute the financial 
responsibility internally  in the consortium  in a fair way.   
There is therefore also NO  need for a report on the distribution of payments  between beneficiaries . 
 The Agency  will formally notify a pre-information letter to the coordinator : 
- informing  it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the Agency  decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
received , it will confirm  the amount to be recovered and formally notify to the coordinator a debit note . 
This note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency will recov er the amount:  
(a) by offsetting it — without the coordinator’s consent —  against any amounts owed to the 
coordinator by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the Agency  may offset 
before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(b) by drawing on  the Guarantee Fund. The Agency  or the Commission will  formally notify the 
coordinator the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:  
(i) not applicable;  
(ii) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision  under 
Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 79(2) of the 
Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the date for 
payment in th e debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment 
of the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late -payment interest and then against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred i n the recovery process will be borne by the coordinator, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC applies.

 MULTI -BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 50 — TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT OR OF THE 
PARTICIPATION OF ONE OR MORE BENEFICIARIES  
50.1 Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiaries  
50.1.1  Conditions and procedure  
The beneficiaries may terminate the Agreement.  
The coordinator must formally notify termination to the A gency  (see Article 52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the date the termination will take effect.  This date must be after the notification.  
If no reasons are given or if the Agency considers the reasons do not justify termination, the Agreement will 
be cons idered to have been ‘ terminated improperly ’. 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification.  
50.1.2 Effects  
The coordinator must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
Article 20).  
If the Agency  does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be reimbursed.  
The Agency  will calculate the final grant amount  (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on the 
basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement.  
In case of  improper termination , the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43).  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
50.2.1  Conditions and procedure  
The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.  
The coordinator must formally notify  termination to the Agency  (see Article 52) and inform the beneficiary 
concerned.  
If the coordinator’s participation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).  
The notification must i nclude:  
-  the reasons why;  
-  the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing);  
-  the date the termination takes effect.  This date must be after the notification, and  
 The Agency  will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on the 
basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement.  
This does not affect the Agency’s  right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative and 
financial sanctions (Article 45).  
The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency  (see Article 46).

 - a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Annex 1) 
and, if necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination 
takes effect after the period set out in Article 3, no req uest for amendment must be included unless 
the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose 
a new coordinator.  
If this information is not given or if the Agency considers that the reasons do not justify ter mination, the 
participation will be considered to have been terminated improperly . 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification.  
50.2.2  Effects  
If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency  (because it calls into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants) the Agreement may be terminated 
according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency , the Agreement is amended  to introdu ce the 
necessary changes (see Article 55).  
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43) or termination of the Agreement 
(see Article 50).  
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 2 2, 23, 36, 38, 40, 42, 
43 and 44) continue to apply.  
50.3  Termination of the Agreement or of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the 
Agency   
50.3.1  Conditions  
The Agency may terminate the Agreement or the participation of one or more beneficiaries, if:  
(a) one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 56);  
(b) a change to their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or those of its 
linked third parties)]  is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or 
calls into question the decision to award the grant;  
(c) following termination of participation for one or more beneficiaries (see above), the necessary 
changes to the Agreement wo uld call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the 
principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 55);  
(d) implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
coordinator (see Article 49.1 ) and either:

50.3.2  Procedure   
Before terminating the Agreement or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the Agency will formally 
notify  the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
- informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and  
- inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and — in case of Point 
(l.ii) above — to inform the Agency  of the measures to ensure compliance with the obligations

termination and the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is not 
continued.  
The termination will take effect : 
- for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), and (l.ii) above: on the day specified in the 
notification of the confirmation (see above);  
- for terminations under Points (a), (d), (f), (k), (l.i) and (m) above: on the day after the notification 
of the confirmation is received.  
50.3.3  Effects  
(b) for termination of th e Agreement :

1. GA te rmination (consortium ) 
The rules on GA termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5 0 H2020 
General MGA ). 
However, for SME Ph1 actions, improper termination by the beneficiar ies will lead to a 100% 
reduction  of the grant.  
 
2. Beneficiary  termination (consortium ) 
The rules on beneficiary  termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
50 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, the SME Ph1  multi-beneficiary MGA has the following  specificities : 
The notification must include a reallocation of the tasks ( Annex 1) , but NO reallocation of the 
estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned.  
Moreover, i f the GA continues  (i.e. it is amended), the termination of the beneficiary will NOT  have 
any effect on the estimated budget (since there is a lump sum for the entire action, i.e. the 
consortium together).  
 The Agency  will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on 
the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the  
Agreement.  
This does not affect the Agency’s  right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative 
sanctions (Article 53).  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency   (see Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
(c) for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries : 
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a request for 
amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Annex 1) and, if 
necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified after 
the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the beneficiary 
concerned is the coordinator. In this case the request for amendment must propose a new coordinator.  
  
If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency  (because it calls into questi on the decision 
awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may be 
terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency , the Agreement is amended  to introduce th e 
necessary changes (see Article 56).  
After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 
42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

1. SME Ph2 actions  
What?  SME Ph2 funds : 
 the implementation of an innovation idea (including, prototyping, testing, demonstrating, 
piloting, large -scale product validation and market replication)  — based on a strategic 
business  plan either developed through P hase 1 or another means . 
The implementation of Phase 2 must focus on innovation activities (e.g. demonstration, testing, 
prototyping, piloting, scaling -up, miniaturisation, design, market replication)  but may also include 
some research.  
A project may be funded in Phase 2 even if  it was not funded in Phase 1.  
The innovation idea must have commercial potential and considerable novelty for its sector (i.e. 
for technological innovation ideas: ‘technology readiness level’ of 6 or above; see General 
Annex G to the H2020 Work Programme ). 
SME actions are normally mono -beneficiary actions , but can also be multi -beneficiary.  
SME actions are funded under Part II of H orizon 2020, ‘Innovation in SMEs’ ( e.g. H2020 -SMEINST -
05-2016-2017). 
 
 
 For more information  on SME Instrument Ph2 actions , see the Funding & Tenders Portal O nline Manual  and 
the H2020 grants fact sheets . 
 For more information on the conditions for participation and funding, see the Funding & Tenders Portal 
Online Manual  or the  General Annexes to the H2020 Work Programme  and the  call and topics pages  of the call.

1. Budget categories  
The SME Ph2 MGA uses the same budget categories as the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the SME Ph2 MGA:  
 direct personnel costs  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment  
 costs for SME owners without salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary  
 direct costs of subcontracting  
 other direct costs  
 travel costs and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure  
 indirect costs  
 specific cost  categories (if option applies).  
Thus, the SME Ph2 MGA does NOT have:   
 personnel costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  
 
 
 
  The budget categories  are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs 
(Article 5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and 
Annex 4).  
 
. 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, brok en down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
party)]  and budget category  (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14] ).

100%, with a GA  based on the General MGA (instead of the SME Ph2 MGA).  ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT, FORM OF GRANT, REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND FORMS 
OF COSTS  
[…] 
5.2 Form of grant, reimbursement rates  and forms of costs  
The grant reimburses  70% of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs 
grant ’) (see Annex 2).  
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount  (insert amount in words )]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the followin g forms (‘ forms of costs ’): 
(a) for direct personnel costs :  
- as actually incurred costs (‘ actual costs ’) or  
- on the basis of an amount per unit calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual 
cost accounting practices (‘ unit costs ’).  
Personnel costs for  SME owners  or if the beneficiary is a natural person  not receiving a salary 
(see Article 6.2, points A.4 and A.5) must be declared on the basis of the amount per unit set out in 
Annex 2a ( unit costs ); 
(b) for direct costs of  subcontracting : as actually incurred costs ( actual costs );  
(c) for direct costs of providing financial support to third parties : not applicable ;

1. Eligible costs — Ineligible costs  
The SME Ph2 MGA uses the same  budget categories  (covering the same types of costs ) as the 
General MGA  and the same eligibility c onditions and calculation rules  apply (see Article 6 
H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since SMEs are  by definition NO non-profit legal entities, they can NOT declare 
additional remuneration ( under budget category A  ‘personnel costs ’; see Article 6.2.A. 1 H2020 
General MGA ).  
 ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
[…] 
6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. direct personnel costs;  
B. direct costs of subcontracting;  
C. not applicable;  
D. other direct costs;  
E. indirect costs;  
F. not app licable.  
‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point E below).  
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to  the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed directly to it.

IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and servic es (see Article 10);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described i n Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency  and the other beneficiaries for 
implementing the act ion.

 ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 Rules for subcontracting  action tasks  
13.1.1 If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may award subcontracts covering the 
implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
The beneficiary must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value fo r money or, if appropriate, the lowest 
price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
[OPTION: In addition, if the value of the subcontract to be awarded exceeds EUR [ …], the beneficiaries 
must comply with the following rules  […]11.] 
 [OPTION for actions involving PCP or PPI: In addition, for the pre -commercial procurement (PCP) or 
procurement of innovative solutions (PPI), the beneficiary must follow a transparent and non -discriminatory 
procedure, including at least the following:  
(a) an ‘open market consultation ’ published in the  Official Journal of the European Union  via a ‘ prior 
information notice  (PIN) ’ and promoted and advertised widely;  
(b) a ‘contract notice ’ allowing for a time -limit for receipt of tenders of at least 2 m onths, published in 
the Official Journal of the European Union  and promoted and advertised widely;  
(c) a ‘request for tenders ’ based on functional or performance -based specifications (that take into 
account the outcome of the open market consultation) and desc ribing the practical set -up for the 
implementation of the subcontract(s);  
(d) an objective and non -discriminatory evaluation  of the tenders and award of subcontract(s);  
(e) a ‘contract award notice ’ published in the  Official Journal of the European Union . 
The beneficiary must also ensure that every prior information notice, contract notice or contract award 
notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer:  
"This procurement receives funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and 
innovation programme under the grant agreement No [number]). The EU is however not 
participating as a contracting authority in this procurement ." ] 
[OPTION 1 only for actions involving PPI:  Participation in PPI tendering procedures must b e open on 
equal terms to tenderers from EU Member States, associated countries12 and other countries with which the 
EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement. If the WTO Government Procurement Agreement 
applies, PPI subcontracts must also be o pen to tenderers from States that have ratified this agreement.  
If the procurement of the innovative solution (PPI) consists (and is limited to) buying a set of prototypes 
and/or test products that were developed during a preceding PCP action, the beneficiary does not need to 
make an open market consultation, contract notice and contract award notice under Points (a), (b) and (e) 
above. In this case, it must  make a request for tenders  from at least three providers  (including the providers 
that parti cipated in the preceding PCP), in accordance with the negotiated procedure without publication 
under Directives 2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU)24.] 
[OPTION 2 only for actions involving PCP: Subcontracts for pre -commercial procurem ent must provide 
for the following:  
- the ownership, by the subcontractors, of the intellectual property rights on the results that they 
generate;  
- the right of the buyer to access results as well as the background necessary to use the results — on 
a royalty -free basis — for its own use;

 - the right of the buyer to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non -exclusive licences to 
third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable conditions —   (without the right to 
sub-licence);  
- the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer to the buyer the ownership of intellectual property 
generated by subcontractors during the PCP, if subcontractors fail to commercially exploit the 
results within the perio d set out in the subcontract;  
- the right of the buyer to publish — at the time of the contract award notice — the identity of the 
winning tenderers and a project summary provided by the winning tenderers, and to publish — 
after R&D has finished and after co nsulting the subcontractors — summaries of the results as well 
as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed the last phase of the PCP.  
The beneficiary must ensure that the majority of the research and development work done by the 
subcontractor(s) (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
associated countries (‘place of performance obligation’). ] 
The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the 
total estimated costs of subcontracting must be set out in Annex 2. The Agency  may however approve 
subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 and 2 without amendment according to Article 55, if:  
- they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report, and  
- they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question t he decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks involving classified information   may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the Agency  (see Article 37). ] 
The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency , the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22 and 23 also towards its 
subcontractors.  
13.1.2 The benefic iary must ensure that its obligations under Articles 35, 36 38 and 46 also apply to the 
subcontractors.  
13.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1, the costs related to the subcontract 
concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Artic le 13.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
43). 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
11 If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportion ality, taking into account 
the value of the contracts and the relative size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the r isk. Specific rules 
must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable provisions 
should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR  60 000. The authorising officer 
may set a threshold higher than EUR  60 000 on the basis of a risk assess ment. 
12 For the definition, see Article 2.1(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 11 December 
2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in “Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Rese arch and 
Innovation (2014 -2020) ” (‘Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 ’) (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013 p.81) : ‘associated country ’ 
means a third country which is party to an international agreement with the Union, as identified in Article 7 of the Horizon 2020 
Framework Programme Regulation No 1291/2013.  Article 7 of the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme Regulation No 1291/2013 sets 
out the conditio ns for association of non -EU countries to Horizon 2020.

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019  SME Ph2 MGA  
SME Ph2 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  631 1. Subcontracting  
The rules on subcontracting for SME Ph2 actions are similar to those of the General MGA (see 
Article s 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The SME Ph2 MGA has h owever  the following  specificities : 
Subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action.  
Moreover, the Agency will as sess compliance with best value  for money during the evaluation  of 
the proposal (and therefore be able to give higher security on subcontracts that are part of the 
proposal).  
Assurance can only be given on subcontracts that are described in sufficient detail in the 
proposal.  
For already awarded  subcontract s: action task(s) that are subcontracted; key information 
on the award procedure ; name of subcontractor, price and object; explanation why the 
subcontractor and the price are appropriate.  
For future subcontract s: action task(s) to be subcontracted ; estimate d budget ; procedure 
that will be follow ed to ensure best value  for money.  
Annex 1 will explicitly identify the subcontracts for which assurance is given by the Agency. 
(For these subcontracts, beneficiaries have assurance that compliance with best value  for 
money wi ll not be challenged in audits — unless it turns out that the beneficiary did not 
follow the procedure described or concealed information for the purpose of the approval).  
Change to a subcontract  — Subcontracts which were assessed during proposal  evaluation 
(and for which assurance was granted ) may be changed (via an amendment ).  
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should contact the Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal  
messag ing function), if they intend to amend the grant to change a subcontract assessed 
during proposal evaluation.  
The amendment request will not be agreed, if it would result in changes that — if known 
before awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision (see Article 
55). 
Example (acceptable):  the subcontractor went bankrupt  
Examples (not acceptable): the action tasks subcontracted changed; increase of price of already 
awarded subcontracts.  
The Agency will examine the change to evaluate its impact on best value for money — and 
will either : 
 grant assurance, on the basis of the justifications provided (similar to those used at 
the proposal stage)  
OR  
 refuse it  (if it considers that the subcontract is not best value for money or if it 
cannot be assessed due to a lack of information) . 
 
 
 
New subcontracts — New subcontracts (i.e.  not already part of the proposal/Annex1 ), will be 
assessed by the Agency for best value for money during the amendment procedure . 
 
 Changes to a subcontract may only be done if the assurance on best value for money is 
granted by the Agency.

SME Ph2 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13  632  
 
Finally, for SME Ph2 actions, subcontracts must provide for the right of the beneficiaries to 
commercially exploit the results generated by subcontractors during the subcontract 
implementation (by way of transfer of the intellectual property rights, licence or other; see  
Article 26.3).  
 If subcontracts are added not via a formal amendment but via the simplified approval procedure: 
there is NO assessment (and the beneficiary therefore bears the full risk ).

1. Reporting periods  
The reporting periods for SME Ph2 actions are normally the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 20. 2 H2020 General MGA ). 
The reporting periods may however be shorter and more frequent than in other H2020 actions .  ARTICLE 20 — REPORTING — PAYMENT REQUESTS  
20.1 Obligation to submit reports  
The beneficiary must submit to the Agency  (see Article 52) the technical and financial reports set out in this 
Article.  
These reports include the requests for payment and must be drawn up using the forms and templates 
provided in the electronic exchange system (see Article 52).  
20.2 Reporting per iods 
The action is divided into the following ‘ reporting periods ’: 
- RP1: from month 1 to month [ X] 
- [- RP2: from month [ X+1] to month [ Y] 
- RP3: from month [ Y+1] to month [ Z] 
- [same for other RPs ] 
- RPN: from month [ N+1]to [the last month of the project ].]

ARTICLE 26 — OWNERSHIP OF RESULTS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Third parties with rights on results — Freedom to operate  
‘Freedom to operate’ means being able to fully commercially exploit the action’s results.  
The beneficiaries must safeguard their freedom to operate in all agreements with employees and 
third part ies involved in the action (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA ). 
Example:  in their agreements with subcontractors, beneficiaries must ensure their right to commercially 
exploit the results of work subcontracted, even if this involves using the subcontractor’s IPR background.  
In addition, they may have to obtain licenses to comm ercially exploit the results from other third 
parties (i.e. third parties that are not participating in the action implementation).  
Example : if a third party that is not involved in the action owns IPRs that may stand in the way of 
commercially exploiting the results, the beneficiary must obtain the license for commercial exploitation.  
 ARTICLE 26 — OWNERSHIP OF RESULTS  
[…] 
26.3 Rights of third parties (including personnel )  
If third parties (including personnel ) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary must ensure that it 
complies with its obligations under the Agreement.  
If a third party generates results for a beneficiary, the beneficiary must  obtain all necessary rights (transfer, 
licences or other) from the third part y, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if those results were 
generated by the beneficiary itself and ensure its possibility to commercially exploit the results (‘ freedom to 
operate ’).  
For this purpose, it must:  
- in agreements with employees o r third parties involved in the action (such as, for instance, 
subcontractors): retain the right to commercially exploit the results (at least for the forms of 
exploitation set out in the ‘commercialisation plan’; see Annex 1), if necessary by agreeing to a 
licence and  
- in all other cases: take measures to obtain, from the third parties, licences for the exploitation.  
If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using third parties to generate the 
results.

1. Participants: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Linked third parties — Third parties 
involved in the action  
ERA-NET Cofund uses in principle the same concepts for participants as the General MGA (i.e. 
coordinator, beneficiaries, linked third parties, etc).  
However, all e ntities participating financially to  the co-funded joint call for proposals MUST 
participate as beneficiaries or linked third parties in the GA ( NOT as other third parties  involved in 
the action ; see Article 8 ). 
 
 
 
New beneficiaries may be added to ERA -NET Cofund actions during grant preparation or later on 
with an amendment to the grant agreement, however:  
 new partners contributing to the co -funded  joint call should not join later than the launch 
of the call; all partners participating in the call have to be members in the consortium or 
linked third parties   
 beneficiaries joining after the launch of the call can ONLY  execute the payments of the 
financial support to the third parties (except in case of transfer of rights and obligations; 
see Article 55 H2020 General MGA ).  The Agreement is composed of:  
Terms  and Conditions  
Annex 1  Description of the action  
Annex 2  Estimated budget for the action  
 2a Additional information on the estimated budget  
Annex 3  Accession Forms  
[OPTION  to be used if Article 14 applies and  if joint and several liability has been

What?  ERA-NET Cofund co-funds : 
 a joint call for proposals for trans -national projects (and additional joint activities) by 
regional /national research and innovation programmes  (— implemented or funded by the 
beneficiaries) .  
‘Funded by the beneficiaries’ means funded by providing financial support to third parties. 
This is normally the case if the beneficiaries are research funders and cash contributions 
are received from national programmes. In this case, the beneficiaries la unch a call for 
proposals, resulting in grants for third parties.  Most ERA -NET Cofund actions are 
implemented in this way.  
‘Implemented by the beneficiaries’ means that the beneficiaries implement the trans -
national projects themselves. This is normally th e case for governmental research 
organisations implementing a research programme based on institutional funding (i.e. not 
project -based funding). In this case, the co -funded call for proposals is based on in -kind 
contributions from their institutional fund ing and the b eneficiaries then carry out the 
selected trans -national projects themselves, either fully or partially.  
Only one funded call per GA.  
and 
 optional: additional activities related to the coordination of national/regional research and 
innovation p rogrammes.  
The additional activities  must relate to the coordination of public research and innovation 
programmes and should focus on preparing and implementing joint activities (including 
other joint calls without EU co -funding; see General Annex D to the H2020  Work 
Programme ). 
These activities must be in addition  to implementing a joint call.  ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED [— COMPLEMENTARY GRANT] [ — JOINTLY 
FUNDED ACTION]  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled [insert title of the action ] — [insert  acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in Annex 1.  
[OPTION for complementary grants if foreseen in the work programme : The grant is a  ‘complementary 
grant ’ to [the grant agreement(s) under the call(s) for proposals [ call identifier(s): H2020 — theme —]] 
[the following complementary grant agreement(s) No(s):  
- [insert number ] [insert acronym ] 
- [insert number ] [insert acronym ]].] 
[OPTION for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation) : The action is 
a ‘jointly funded action ’ which must be coordinated with the ‘joint action’  called [ insert the name of the 
third country or international organisation action ], as described in Annex 1. ]

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 2 > Article 2  639 If the additional activities consist in additional calls without top -up funding from the 
EU, the requirements set out in Article 15  do NOT apply.  
Normally, ERA -NET Cofund grants are multi -beneficiary grants; exceptionall y they can be mono -
beneficiary grants for sole participants (see General Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
ERA-NET Cofund actions are funded in all Parts of H orizon 2020  (e.g. FETPROACT -02-2017; SC5-
33-2017).

ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Action d uration  
For ERA -NET Cofund actions, the action duration is usually 60 months . (This relatively long time 
is needed because these actions include call preparation, launch of the call, proposal submission 
and evaluation, the selection decision, and implementation of  the selected transnational projects 
— which typically takes 36 months. ) 
If implementation of the action is justifiably delayed, the consortium may request an extension 
(i.e. request an amendment extending the action duration; see Article 55  H2020 General 
MGA ). Normally, the duration can  NOT however  exceed 72 months.  ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
The duration of the action  will be 60 months  as of [OPTION 1 by default:  the first day of the month 
following the date the Agreement enters into force (see Article 58)] [ OPTION 2 if needed for the action : 
[insert date ]]7 (‘starting date of the action’).  
 
7 This date must be the first day of a month and it must be later than the date of entry into force of the agreement, unless authorised 
otherwise by the authorising officer, if the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the action before the entry into for ce of the grant 
agreement , or the need to start the action on another day than the first day of the month. In any case, the starting date should not be 
earlier than the date of the submission of the grant application (Article 130 FR).

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The ERA -NET Cofund MGA uses its own budget categories.  
Budget categories of the ERA -NET Cofund MGA:  
 direct costs related to trans -national projects  
 direct costs of providing financial support to third parties implementing trans -
national projects  
 direct costs for the implementation of trans -national  projects by the beneficiaries:  
 direct personnel costs for the implementation of trans -national projects by 
the beneficiaries  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded by a thi rd party against payment  
 direct costs of subcontracting for the implementation of trans -national 
projects by the beneficiaries  
 other direct costs for the implementation of trans -national projects by the 
beneficiaries  
 travel costs and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure  
 direct coordination costs for additional activities  
 indirect costs . 
Thus, the ERA -NET Cofund MGA does NOT have :  
 personnel costs f or SME owners without salary  
 personnel costs  for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary  
 personnel costs for providing trans -national or virtual access to research infrastructure  
 specific cost categories . ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out  in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked 
third party)]  and budget category  (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14] ). [OPTION  to be used if Article 9 or 14a 
applies: It also shows the estimated costs of the beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see Article 
9)[and][international partners (see Article 14a)].]

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 3 > Article 5.1/5.2  644 At the end of reporting period 1, the beneficiaries must however make an amendment to adjust 
the initial  budget (i.e. Annex 2, estimated eligible and, if needed, maximum grant amount) down 
to the amount justified by the selection list and the commitme nts to fund.   
Best practice: If the amendment concerns a very limited share of the budget, beneficiaries are 
invited to first consult the Commission/Agency to verify if the amendment is needed.  
 
2. Reimbursement rate  
How much? For ERA -NET Cofund , the reimbursement rate is currently set at 33 % (see General 
Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
 
3. Cost forms  
The ERA -NET Cofund MGA, uses the same  cost forms  as the  General MGA  (i.e. actual costs, unit 
costs and flat rate costs; see Article  5 H2020 General MGA ). 
Cost forms of the ERA -NET Cofund MGA:  
 actual costs  for:

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category.  
The ERA -NET Cofund MGA has its own budget categories . Some of them cover  however the 
same types of costs as the General MGA, with the same eligibility  conditions  and calculation 
rules  (see Article  6 H2020 General MGA ). 
For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise  — for each budget 
category  — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
1. types of costs covered by the budget category  
2. cost form under which the costs must be declared (i.e. actual costs, unit costs, flat rate)  
3. eligibility conditions  
4. how the costs must be calculated.  ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
[…] 
6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. direct costs related to trans -nation al projects;  
B. direct coordination costs for additional activities;  
C. indirect costs.  
‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point C below).  
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed directly to it.

 A. Direct costs related to trans -national projects    
A.1 Direct costs of providing financial support to third parties implementing trans -national projects  
are eligible if the conditions set out in Article 15.1.1 are met.  
A.2 Direct costs for the implementation of trans -national projects  by the beneficiari es are eligible, if 
they comply with the conditions set out in Article 15.1.1 and the following:  
A.2.1  Direct personnel costs for the implementation of trans -national projects  by the beneficiaries  
Types of eligible personnel costs  
A.2.1.1 Personnel costs are eligible, if they are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an 
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the implementation of  trans -national 
projects (‘ costs for employees (or equivalent) ’). They must be limit ed to salaries (including during 
parental leave), social security contributions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration , if they 
arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act).  
Beneficiaries that are non -profi t legal entities8 may also declare as personnel costs additional 
remuneration  for personnel assigned to the implementation of  trans -national projects (including payments 
on the basis of supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:  
(a) it is par t of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner 
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required;  
(b) the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the 
benefic iary, regardless of the source of funding used.  
'Additional remuneration' means any part of the remuneration which exceeds what the person would be paid 
for time worked in projects funded by national schemes.  
Additional remuneration for personnel assigned to the implementation of  trans -national projects is eligible 
up to the following amount:  
(a) if the person works full time and exclusively on the implementation of trans -national projects 
during the full year: up to EUR 8  000; 
(b) if the person works exclusively o n the implementation of trans -national projects but not full -time or 
not for the full year: up to the corresponding pro -rata amount of EUR 8  000, or  
(c) if the person does not work exclusively on the implementation of trans -national projects: up to a 
pro-rata amount calculated as follows:  
{{EUR 8  000 
divided by  
the number of annual productive hours (see below)},  
multiplied by  
the number of hours that the person has worked on the trans -national projects during the year }. 
A.2.1.2 The costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  with the beneficiary other than an 
employment contract are eligible personnel costs, if:  
(a) the person works under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way 
the work is organised, the tasks tha t are performed and the premises where they are performed);  
(b) the result of the work carried out belongs to the beneficiary (unless exceptionally agreed 
otherwise), and  
(c) the costs are not significantly different from those for personnel performing similar ta sks under an 
employment contract with the beneficiary.  
A.2.1.3 The costs of  personnel seconded  by a third party against payment  are eligible personnel costs if 
the conditions in Article 11.1 are met.

 Calculation  
Personnel costs must be calculated by the beneficiaries as follows:  
{{hourly rate  
multiplied by  
number of actual hours worked on the implementation of trans -national projects},  
plus   
for non -profit legal entities: additional remuneration to personnel assigned to the implementation of trans -national 
projects under the conditions set out above (Point A.2.1.1) }. 
The number of actual hours declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 18).  
The total number of hours declared in EU o r Euratom grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than 
the annual productive hours used for the calculations of the hourly rate. Therefore, the maximum number of 
hours that can be declared for the grant are:  
{number of annual productive hours for  the year (see below)  
minus  
total number of hours declared by the beneficiary, for that person for that year, for other EU or Euratom grants}.  
The ‘ hourly rate ’ is one of the following:  
(a) for personnel costs declared as actual costs  (i.e. budget categories A .2.1.1,A.2.1.2 and A.2.1.3) : the 
hourly rate is calculated per full financial year as follows:  
{actual annual personnel costs (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
divided by  
number of annual productive hours}.  
using the personnel costs and the number of productive hours for each full financial year covered 
by the reporting period concerned. If a financial year is not closed at the end of the reporting period, 
the beneficiaries must use the hourly rate of the last closed financial year availa ble. 
For the ‘number of annual productive hours’, the beneficiaries may choose one of the following:  
(i) 'fixed number of hours': 1  720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro -
rata for persons not working full time);  
(ii) 'individual annual produc tive hours': the total number of hours worked by the person in the 
year for the beneficiary, calculated as follows:  
{annual workable hours of the person (according to the employment contract, applicable 
collective labour agreement or national law)  
plus 
overtime worked  
minus  
absences (such as sick leave and special leave)}.  
‘Annual workable hours’ means the period during which the personnel must be working, 
at the employer’s disposal and carrying out his/her activity or duties under the 
employment contract, applicable collective labour agreement or national working time 
legislation.  
If the contract (or applicable collective labour agreement or national working time 
legislation) does not allow to determine the annual workable hours, this option cannot be 
used.

 (iii) ‘standard annual productive hours’: the standard number of annual hours generally 
applied by the beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting 
practices. This number must be at least 90  % of  the ‘standard annual workable hours’.  
If there is no applicable reference for the standard annual workable hours, this option 
cannot be used.  
For all options, the actual time spent on  parental leave by a person assigned to the 
implementation of trans -national projects may be deducted from the number of annual 
productive hours.  
 As an alternative, beneficiaries may calculate the hourly rate per month , as follows:  
 
{{actual monthly personnel cost (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
 
divided b y  
 
{number of annual productive hours / 12} }. 
 
using the personnel costs for each month and (one twelfth of) the annual productive hours 
calculated according to either option (i) or (iii) above, i.e.:  
 
- fixed number of hours or  
 
- standard annual productive hours.  
 
Time spent on parental leave may not be deducted when calculating the hourly rate per month. 
However, beneficiaries may declare personnel costs incurred in periods of parental leave in 
proportion to the time the person worked on the action in that financial year.  
 
If parts of a basic remuneration are generated over a period longer than a month, the 
beneficiaries may include only the share which is generated in the month (irrespectively of the 
amount actually paid for that month).  
 
Each beneficiary must use only one option (per full financial year or per month) during each full 
financial year;  
 
(b) for personnel costs declared on the basis of unit costs (i.e. budget categories A.2.1.1 and A.2.1.2)  
calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices : the hourly rate 
calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices , if: 
- the cost accounting practices used are applied in a consistent manne r, based on objective 
criteria, regardless of the source of funding;  
- the hourly rate is calculated using the actual personnel costs recorded in the beneficiary’s 
accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget categories;  
The actual personnel costs may be adjusted by the beneficiary on the basis of budgeted or 
estimated elements. Those elements must be relevant for calculating the personnel costs, 
reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information, and  
- the hourly  rate is calculated using the number of annual productive hours (see above).  
A.2.2  Direct costs of subcontracting for the implementation of trans -national projects  by the 
beneficiaries  (including related duties, taxes and charges such as non -deductible val ue added tax (VAT) 
paid by the beneficiary) are eligible  if the conditions in Article 13.1.1 are met.  
A.2.3  Other direct costs for the implementation of trans -national projects  by the beneficiaries  
A.2.3.1  Travel costs and related subsistence allowances (including related duties, taxes and charges such 
as non -deductible value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are eligible if they are in line with the 
beneficiary’s usual practices on travel.

recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts are eligible, if they were purchased in accordance with Article 10.1.1 
and written off in accordance with international accountin g standards and the beneficiary’s usual accounting 
practices.  
The costs of  renting or leasing equipment, infrastructure or other assets (including related duties, taxes and 
charges such as non -deductible value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are a lso eligible, if they do 
not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or assets and do not include any 
financing fees.  
The costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets contributed in -kind against  payment are eligible, if 
they do not exceed the depreciation costs of similar equipment, infrastructure or assets, do not include any 
financing fees and if the conditions in Article 11.1 are met.  
The only portion of the costs that will be taken into account is that which corresponds to the duration of the 
trans -national projects implemented by the beneficiary and rate of actual use for the purposes of the 
transnational projects implemented by the beneficiary.  
A.2.3.3  Costs of other goods and services (including related duties, taxes and charges such as non -
deductible value added tax (VAT) paid by the beneficiary) are eligible, if they are:  
(a) purchased specifically for the trans -national projects implemented by the beneficiary and in 
accordance with Article 10.1 or 
(b) contributed in kind ag ainst payment and in accordance with Article 11.1.  
Such goods and services include , for instance, consumables and supplies,  dissemination (including open 
access), protection of results, certificates on the financial statements (if they are required by the 
Agreement), certificates on the methodology, translations and publications.  
A.2.3.4 Capitalised and operating costs of ‘large research infrastructure’9[OPTION 1 by default: 
directly used for the trans -national projects  implemented by the beneficiary are el igible, if:  
(a)  the value of the large research infrastructure represents at least 75  % of the total fixed assets (at 
historical value in its last closed balance sheet  before the date of the signature of the Agreement or 
as determined on the basis of the rent al and leasing costs of the research infrastructure10); 
(b) the beneficiary’s methodology for declaring the costs for large research infrastructure has been 
positively assessed by the Commission (‘ ex-ante assessment ’); 
(c)  the beneficiary declares as direct eligible costs only the portion which corresponds to the duration 
of the trans -national projects implemented by the beneficiary and the rate of actual use for the 
purposes of the trans -national projects implemented by th e beneficiary, and  
(d) they comply with the conditions as further detailed in the annotations to the H2020 Grant 
Agreements. ] 
[OPTION 2 to be used if foreseen in the work programme: Not applicable. ] 
A.2.3.5 Costs of internally invoiced goods and services direc tly used for the action are eligible, if: : 
(a) they are declared on the basis of a unit cost calculated in accordance with the beneficiary's usual 
cost accounting practices;  
(b) the cost accounting practices used are applied in a consistent manner, based on object ive criteria, 
regardless of the source of funding;  
(c) the unit cost is calculated using the actual costs for the good or service recorded in the beneficiary’s 
accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget categories.

 other direct costs for  the implementation of trans -national projects  by the 
beneficiaries:  
 travel and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment  The actual costs may be adjusted by the beneficiary on the basis of budgeted or estimated 
elements. Those elements must be relevant for calculating the costs, reasonable and correspond 
to objective and verifiable information;  
(d) the unit cost excludes any costs of items which are not directly linked to the production of the 
invoiced goods or service.  
 ‘Internally invoiced goods and services’ means goods or services which are provided by the beneficiary 
directly for the action and  which the beneficiary values on the basis of its usual cost accounting practices.

December 2013 laying down the rules for the pa rticipation and dissemination in "Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2014 -2020)" ( 'Rules for Participation Regulation No  1290/2013 ') (OJ L 347, 20.1.2013 p.81): ‘ non-
profit legal entity ’ means a legal entity which by its legal form is non -profit -making or which has a legal or statutory obligation not 
to distribute profits to its shareholders or individual members.  
9 ‘Large r esearch infrastructure ’ means research infrastructure of a total value of at least EUR 20 million, for a beneficiary, 
calculated as the sum of historical asset values of each individual research infrastructure of that beneficiary, as they appe ar in its las t 
closed balance sheet before the date of the signature of the Agreement or as determined on the basis of the rental and leasin g costs of 
the research infrastructure.  
10 For the definition see Article 2(6) of Rules for Participation: ‘ Research infrastructu re’ are facilities, resources and services that are 
used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in their fields. Where relevant, they may be used beyond 
research, e.g. for education or public services. They include: major sci entific equipment (or sets of instruments); knowledge -based 
resources such as collections, archives or scientific data; e -infrastructures such as data and computing systems and communication 
networks; and any other infrastructure of a unique nature essenti al to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Such 
infrastructures may be ‘single -sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.A  651  other goods and services  
 costs of large research infrastructure.  
What?  These budget categories cover  costs for the implementation of t rans-national projects . 
What not?  They do not cover the costs for organising the calls (i.e. preparation  of the call, 
selection of the projects etc .) or for additional coordination and networking activities of 
beneficiaries implementing trans -national proj ect themselves. Such costs  are NOT eligible  under 
the ERA -NET grant .  
 
 
1.2 All costs must  normally  be declared as  actual costs (see Article 5.2(b) ).  
Personnel costs (average personnel costs) and costs of internally invoiced goods and services 
may also be declared as unit cost in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices.  
1.3 In principle, t he same eligibility c onditions  apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 
H2020 General MGA ).  
The ERA -NET Cofund MGA has however the following  specificities : 
In some Articles, the conditions in the General MGA must be read as referring to ‘trans -national 
projects’ (instead of ‘action’).  
Moreover, there are additional cost eligibility conditions in Article 15  for financial  support to third 
parties (e.g. selection procedure, compliance with national funding rules) .  
Finally, costs f or financial support to  third parties are usually eligible only AFTER  the trans -national 
projects have ended.  
1.4 The same calculation rules  apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA ). 
  The beneficiaries must use their own funds for such activities.

1. Additional coordination costs  (B.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility 
conditions  — Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers the direct costs for additional activities related to the 
coordination of national/regional research and innovation programmes (see also Article 2 ). 
1.2 The costs must be declared  as the unit cost fixed by Decision C(2013) 8200118 and indicated  
in Annex 2 of the GA ( currently EUR 29  000 per beneficiary per year).  
In practice, the declaration of costs for additional activities is very simple and almost completely 
automatized : The beneficiary must only indicate the number of years (dur ing which such activities  
were implemented) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT system.  
1.3 The costs  must fulfil  the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action 
duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(b) ) 
 be declared for the additional coordination activities  described in Annex 1.  
Costs for additional coordination activities are limited to the beneficiaries that carry out such 
activities.  
Beneficiaries that implement trans -national projects can  NOT declare any additional coordination 
costs. 
1.4 They are calculated  (automatically by the IT system) as follows:  
amount per unit (EUR 29  000)  x  number of years in which additional activities were carried out  
According to General Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme , the EU funding for  coordination 
costs should not exceed 20  % of the maximum grant amount  set out in Article 5.1 .

net_cofund_en.pd f. 
  If the additional activities are not properly implemented as described in Annex 1, the grant may be 
reduced  (see Articles 7  and 43). 
Example:  Beneficiaries make only two meetings on general strategy . 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 B. Direct coordination costs for additional activities   
Direct coordination costs for additional activities  are eligible, if they correspond to the amount per unit 
set out in Annex 2a multiplied by the number of actual years in which the  beneficiary has carried out the 
‘additional activities’ described in Annex 1.  
Beneficiaries that implement transnational projects (partially or fully) themselves cannot declare direct 
coordination costs for additional activities.

1. Indirect costs  (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility  conditions  — Calculation  
For this budget category, in principle the same rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article  6 
H2020 General MGA ).  
The flat -rate is however calculated on t he following eligible direct costs:  
 direct costs for the implementation of trans -national projects by the beneficiaries  
 direct coordination costs for additional activities.  
‘Direct costs of providing financial suppo rt to third parties implementing trans -national 
projects ’ are NOT included . 
 C. Indirect costs  
Indirect costs are eligible if they are declared on the basis of the flat-rate of 25  % of the eligible direct costs 
(see Article 5.2 and Points A and B above), from which are excluded:  
(a) costs of subcontracting  for the implementation of trans -national projects  by the beneficiaries ;   
(b) costs of in -kind contributions provided by third parties which are not used on the beneficiary’s 
premises and  
(c) costs of financial support to third parties implementing trans -national projects.  
Beneficiaries receiving an operating grant11 financed by the EU or E uratom budget cannot declare indirect 
costs for the period covered by the operating grant, unless they can demonstrate that the operating grant 
does not cover any costs of the action.[…]  
11  For the definition, see Article 121(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation : ‘operating grant ’ means direct financial contribution, by way of 
donation, from the budget in order to finance the functioning of a body which pursues an aim of general EU interest or has an  objective 
forming part of and supporting an EU policy .

1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For ERA -NET Cofund actions, generally  the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the 
General MGA (see Article  8 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, entities contributing to the joint call for proposals can only participate as beneficiaries or 
linked third parties (NOT as other third parties involved in the action).  
Linked third parties  may participate in all activities under the action . Use of third party 
resources  (i.e. purchasing of goods, works or services (Article 10), in -kind contributions (Articles 
11 and 12) or subcontractors (Article 13)) is ONLY  allowed for beneficiaries /linked third parties  
that implement trans -national projects  (NOT for beneficiaries that only provid e financial 
support to third parties — with the exception of third parties with authorisation to administer 
described in the specific cases  below )).  
 
Specific cases ( third parties involved in the action ): 
Authorisation to administer  — Beneficiaries providing financial support to third parties may 
exceptionally delegate administrative tasks (such as the administration of payments to the final 
recipients) to other legal entities (third parties) which they created or control and to which they have 
granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ (i.e.  to handle their administrative affairs) .  
Sometimes th is also include s the handling of the EU contribution . In this case, the beneficiary will use 
the bank account of the third party and all payments made to that account will count for the 
beneficiary . Moreover, the third party will then pass on the EU contribution to thefinal recipientsand 
those payments will be registered in the accounts of the third party).  
The services rendered  by these third party  are usually qualified as in -kind contributions against 
payment. If the costs are not recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary (e.g. there is no invoice from 
the entity) :  ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources  to implement the action.  
If it is necessary for the implementation of the trans -national projects by the beneficiaries, they m ay: 
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission] [Agency]  and the other 
beneficiaries for implementing the action.

 ARTICLE 15 — SUPPORT TO OR IMPLEMENTATION OF TRANS -NATIONAL PROJECTS  
15.1 Rules for providing support to or implementation of trans -national projects  
15.1.1 The beneficiaries must provide financial support  to trans -national projects or implement  such 
proje cts (partially or fully) themselves, in accordance with the following conditions:  
(a) types of activity that qualify for financial support and persons or categories of persons that may 
receive financial support:  
The projects must be trans -national projects , involving at least two independent entities from two 
different EU Member States or associated countries;  
(b) selection procedure  and criteria:  
The projects must be selected following a single joint transnational call for proposals.  
The beneficiaries must make th e selection through a two -step procedure:  
- Step 1: review at national or trans -national level  
- Step 2: single international peer review.  
Only entities that are eligible for funding under the national programmes involved in the joint call 
may be invited to Step 2.  
In Step 2, the beneficiaries must evaluate proposals with the assistance of at least three 
independent experts , on the basis of the following award criteria:  
 (a) excellence;  
 (b) impact;  
 (c) quality and efficiency of the implementation.  
Proposals  must be ranked according to the evaluation results. The selection must be made on the 
basis of this ranking . 
The selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who must make a 
report (see Article 20.2a);  
(c) other conditions:  
In the case of support to entities that are third parties, the beneficiaries must ensure that  [the 
Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti -Fraud 
Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22 and 23 also towards the third parties 
receiving financial support.  
Financial support to entities that are third parti es must comply with national funding rules . 
The maximum amount of financial support to a third party and the criteria for  determining the  
exact amount  under national funding rules are set out in Annex 1.

1. Providing financial support — Implementing trans -national projects  
A core part of ERA-NET Cofund actions  is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e . pass on 
the EU support they receive via the ERA -NET Cofund grant to recipients  that are not party to the 
GA, also called ‘cascade funding ’). 
In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing  the financ ial support, while it is the 
final recipients  (third parties) that actually implement  the trans -national  research and/or 
innovation projects.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15.1.2 In addition,  the beneficiaries must:  
- publish a joint call on a dedicated webpage and promote it at national/regional level via their 
usual channels of communications to potential proposers;  
- keep the joint call open for at least 60 days;  
- take all lawful steps to ensure  confidentiality of information and documents obtained during 
the evaluation and selection procedures of the joint call.  
15.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.1, the costs of the beneficiary for it s financial 
support to the trans -national projects or for the implementation of its trans -national projects will be 
ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42).  
If the beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.2, the gran t may be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 Beneficiar ies can in principle NOT also be final recipient  (since that is not the purpose of a 
cascading grant) .  
However, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the call can be opened also for 
other beneficiaries of the EU grant or  other departments of the same beneficiary ). 
In this case , the consortium will be asked during grant preparation to : 
 identify the beneficiaries which can apply for funding under the co -funded call for proposals  
 explain the m easures to mitigate (potential)  conflict of interest or unequal treatment of 
applicants  and 
 reflect this fully in their description of the action (Annex 1 to the GA), both in the context of 
the description of the co -funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the trans -national 
projects . 
Moreover, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘Chinese walls’) to prevent exchanges or 
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants   and ensure  
independent and fair complaints procedures.  
Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary  providing th e financial support , NOT  by the final 
recipient receiving th e financial support  (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the grant  and 
can therefor e declare other costs) . 
If the call is NOT open other beneficiaries of the EU grant or other departments of the same 
beneficiary , this should also be explicitly mentioned in the description of the action (Annex 1 to the 
GA).

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 15  658 ERA-NET grants can however also include actions which are implemented by t he beneficiaries 
themselves , if for eseen in the work programme .  
 
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Trans -national projects  
The projects must be trans -national (i.e. they must involve at least two independent entities from 
two different EU Member States or H2020 associated countries), both in case of:  
 financial support to third parties and  
 implementation of the projects by the beneficiaries themselves.  
Note that additional eligibility conditions may apply in specific cases concerning the minimum 
number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).  
 
3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Two -step selection procedure  
The beneficiar ies must select the trans -national projects according to a two -step procedure , 
ensur ing that: 
 only entities that are eligible for funding under the national funding rules are invited to 
Step 2 and  
 consortia can balance the requested funding and available funding per participating EU 
Member State and H2020 associated country  between Steps 1 and 2.  
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Independent experts — Observer  
In addition to expert evaluators, the beneficiaries  must appoint an in dependent expert a s an 
observer  to verify that the selection procedure (and, in particular, the peer review evaluation and 
the ranking) meets the requirements of Article  15.  
The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report (see 
Article 20.3 ). 
 
5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Ranking list(s) — Joint selection list  
The beneficiaries must base their selection ( joint selection list ) on the order of the ranking list 
(or the ranking lists, if there are different topics).  
If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States 
or H2020 associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to 
maximise the number of selected projec ts. 
The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of 
the periodic report (see Article 20.3 ). 
 
 
  Article 15 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 15.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 15.1.2).

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 15  659 6. Additional cost eligibility condition: Compliance with national funding r ules 
If the beneficiaries provide  financial support to third parties, the support must comply with the 
applicable national funding rules.  
The t rans-national projects must have been implemented (by the recipients ) in compliance 
with those rules.  
Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that costs are checked and that their payments are 
made in compliance with those rules (and certify this; see Article 20.4 ). 
 
7. Additional cost eligibility condition: Conditions for support  set out in Annex 1 — 
Maximum amount of financial support  
If the beneficiaries provide financial support to third parties, t he beneficiaries  may not exceed the  
maximum amount of financial support set out in Annex 1 and must apply the criteria set out in 
Annex 1 for fixing  the exact amount  of funding .  
This information must already be part of the proposal (see the proposal templates ).  
For bot h, the beneficiaries should rely on the applicable national funding rules. If the national 
rules do not specify a maximum amount, they must enter the amount of their part of the call 
budget.

1. Reports  
What & When ? For ERA -NET Cofund actions, the coordinator must submit a periodic report  
after the end of each reporting period (including the final one).  
Before the end of the action,  these are only technical report s, with information on the technical 
implementation.  
List of documents for the technical reports:  
 explanation of the work carried out  
 overview of the progress  
 summary for publication  
 questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested)  
 ranking list of the projects  
 observer  report on the evaluation  - the costs can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documentation 
(see Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the 
context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 22), and  
- all the receipts  have been declared (see Article 5.3.3) ; 
(ii) an explanation of the use of resources  and the information on subcontracting (see Article 
13) and in -kind contributions provided by third parties (see Articles 11 and 12) from each 
beneficiary [and from each linked third  party] ; 
(iii) [OPTION 1 if the JRC is a beneficiary:  information  on the amount of payment of the 
balance to be paid by the [Commission][Agency] to the Joint Research Centre 
(JRC) ;][OPTION 2: not applicable; ] 
(iv) a ‘summary financial statement ’ , created automatically by the electronic exchange 
system, consolidating the individual financial statements  and including the request for 
payment of the balance ; 
(v) a ‘certificate on the financial statements ’ (drawn up in accordance with  Annex 5) for 
each beneficiary [and for each linked third party] , if it requests a total contribution  of 
EUR 325  000 or more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the 
basis of its usual cost accounting practices (see Article 5.2 and Point A.2.1 of Article 6.2) . 
20.5 Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
In addition to the reporting requirements set out above (Article 20.1 to 20.3), the coordinator must inform 
the [Commission] [Agency]  by [31 December][30 November]  each year of the cumulative expenditure 
incurred by the beneficiaries from the starting date of the action.  
This information is required for the Commission ’s accounting purposes and will not be used to calculate the 
final grant amount.

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  665  joint selection list  
 comm itment on availability of funds  (Annex 7)  
 statement on the use of the previous pre -financing instalment  (Annex 8) . 
NO financial reporting is needed during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final 
report). The coordinator  only has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre -
financing instalment (which includes the request for further pre -financing payments; only the first 
pre-financing payment is automatic;  see Annex 8 ). 
How?  Each periodic  report must be prepared  by the coordinator  and the  other  beneficiaries  
together , directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal ). 
 
2. Reporting periods  
ERA-NET Cofund actions are normally divided into 2 reporting periods with 2 pre-financing 
payments  (or exceptionally 3 reporting periods with 3 pre-financing payments, if the 
Commission/Agency does not have sufficient payment credits to pay the entire amount as a 
second pre -financing payment;  see Article 21 ). 
The first (and, if there are 2 pre-financing payments, also the second) reporting period triggers a 
periodic report.  
 
3. Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
Since reporting periods in ERA -NET Cofund actions normally exceed 18 months and ERA -NET 
Cofund grants are normally above EUR 5  000 000 with a pre -financing payment, all ERA -NET 
grants contai n this clause.  
The declaration is normally handled as deliverable (see Article 19 ).

 ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments  to be made   
The following payments will be made to the coordinator:  
- a first pre -financing  payment;  
- a second pre -financing  payment, on the basis of the request for a second pre -financing payment 
(see Article 20);  
-  [a third pre -financing  payment, on the basis of the request for a third pre -financing payment (see 
Article 20);]  
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the req uest for payment of the balance (see Article 20)  
21.2  Pre-financing payments — Amount  — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment o f the balance.  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
Article 58) or from 10 days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest  — 
make a first pre -financing p ayment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], 
except if Article 48 applies.  
From this amount, an amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 5  % of 
the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the [Commission][Agency]  and transferred into 
the ‘Guarantee Fund ’. 
The [Commission][Agency]  will — within 60 days after receiving the request (see Article 20) — make a 
second pre -financing pa yment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], except 
if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
[OPTION in case of three pre -financing payments:  The [Commission][Agency] will — within 60 days 
after receiving the request (see Article 20) — make  a third pre -financing payment to the coordinator of 
EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. ] 
If the statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment shows that less than 70  % of the previous 
payment  has been used to cover the costs of the action, the amount of the new pre -financing to be paid will 
be reduced by the difference between the 70  % threshold and the amount used.  
[OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary:  The parts of the pre -financing payments related to the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) ([ insert amounts  (insert amounts in words) ] are not paid to the coordinator, but 
kept by the [ Commission][Agency] for the JRC.] 
21.3 Interim payments  — Amount — Calculation  
Not applicable  
[…] 
21.5 Notification of amounts due  
When making payments, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify to the coordinator the amount due, 
specifying whether it concerns the second [or third]  pre-financing payment or the payment of the balance.  
For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.

ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  667  
 
 
 
 
1. Payments to be made — No interim payments  
ERA-NET Cofund actions normally are divided into 2 reporting periods (see Article 20.2 ) with 2 
pre-financing payments  (— unless t he action is exceptionally  divided into 3 reporting periods with 
3 pre-financing payments  because the Commission/Agency does not have sufficient payment 
credits ). 
There are NO interim payments, but th e second pre -financing payment (after the end of the first 
reporting period, i.e. after the evaluation of the trans -national projects) provides beneficiaries with 
the necessary funds to support or implement the trans -national projects.  
The second (or third ) pre-financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requested by the 
coordinator via a statement on the use of the previous  pre-financing payment (see Article 20 ).  
In this statement, the beneficiaries must simply declare how much of the previous pre -
financing was used up, not how much costs were incurred (since ERA -NET Cofund pre-
financing is NOT linked to financial reporting ). 
The balance is paid when the action end s (after the submission of financial reports) .  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
Pre-financing payment  
How much?  Typically  (and depending on the availability of EU budget credits) , the amounts of 
the pre -financing payments for ERA -NET Cofund actions are as follows:  
 for the first pre -financing payment : between 10% and  30 % of the maximum grant amount   
 for the second pre -financing payment : between 60 % and 80%  of the maximum grant 
amount.  
If the GA provides for a 3 pre-financing payment s, then the amount is divided as follows:  
 30 % for the first pre -financing payment  
 30 % for the second pre -financing payment  
 30 % for the third pre -financing payment.  
 
 
 
  The second/third pre -financing payment will be reduced , if — according to the statement on use of the 
previous pre -financing instalment — the previous pre -financing was not fully  used : 
 if 70% or more of the first/second pre -financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing is 
paid in full  
 if less than 70% of the first/second pre -financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing will 
be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 70%.  
 
 
 
. 
 In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 45.

1. PCP/PPI actions  
What?  PCP/PPI funds : 
 one single  joint public procurement of research and development (R&D) services (PCP) or 
one joint or several coordinated public procurements for innovative solutions (PPI)  
AND 
 related additional coordination and networking activities . 
For PCP action s, it must be o nly one PCP  per GA ; for PPI actions , it can be  one joint  or several 
coordinated PPIs  per GA.  
The additional activities  must relate to the joint call for tender, including coordination and 
networking activities needed to prepare, manage and follow -up the PCP/PPI procurement and 
other coordination and networking activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side  
activities (see General Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
Examples:  activities that aim to remove barriers to introducing an innovative solution on  the market 
(including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities that prepare the ground for cooperation 
on future PCP or PPI projects .  
Coordination activities needed to coordinate the PCP/PPI procurement  are mandatory . Other 
additional activities are optional (e.g. other coordination and networking activities to embed 
the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities) .  
Normally, PCP/PPI grants are multi -beneficiary grants; exceptionally they can be mono -beneficia ry 
grants for ‘sole participants’ (see General Annex C and D to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
PCP/PPI actions are funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020 (e.g.  SEC-09-FCT-2017).  
The possibility to have several coordinated PPIs was introduced with GA version 4.0 but is also 
open to older grant agreements.  ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED [— COMPLEMENTARY GRANT] [ — JOINTLY

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Estimated budget  
When submitting the proposal with the estimated eligible costs for PCP/ PPI actions, the consortium 
must decide  who will pay the PCP/PPI subcontracts (and who may — by consequence — declare 
the subcontracting costs), i.e.:  
 either the lead procurer (centralised payment; the consortium has a common jointly -
committed budget; the lead procurer is mandated to sign the subcontracts and pays all 
subcontractors;  see Article 13 ). 
OR 
 the members of the buyers group (the individual members of the buyers group pay the 
subcontractors pro rata;  see Article 13 ). 
 
2. Budget categories  
The PCP/ PPI  MGA uses its own budget categories . 
Budget categories of the PCP/ PPI  MGA:  
 direct costs of  PCP/PPI subcontracting  
These are the costs for procuring the R&D services (in the case of PCP) or the innovative 
solutions (in the case of PPI) (i.e. the estimated procurement p rice).  
Only the beneficiary(ies) that pay the PCP/PPI suppliers can declare PCP/PPI subcontracting 
costs. Who actually pays the PCP/PPI suppliers depends on the choice made by the 
consortium when submitting the estimated eligible costs: either the lead pr ocurer or the 
members of the buyers group (see Article 4 ). 
 costs of related additional coordination and networking activities  
 direct personnel costs for related additional coordination and networking activities  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded b y a third party against payment  
 costs for SME owners without salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are  natural persons without salary  ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broke n down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
party)]  and budget category  (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14] ). [OPTION  to be used if Article 9 or 14 a applies: 
It also shows the estimated costs of the beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see Article 
9)[and][international partners (see Article 14a)].]

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  PCP/PPI MGA  
PCP/PPI > Chapter 2 > Article 4.1  674  personn el costs for providing trans -national ac cess to research 
infrastructure  
 direct costs of subcontracting for related additional coordination and networking 
activities  
 other direct costs for related additional coordination and networking activities  
 travel costs and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure  
 indirect costs for related additional coordination and networking activities  
 specific cost categorie s (if option applies) . 
Thus, the PCP/ PPI  MGA does NOT have:   
 direct c osts of providing financial support to third parties.  
 
 
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs 
(Article 5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 
and Annex 4).

grant ’) (see Annex 2) . 
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following forms (‘ forms of costs ’): 
(a) for direct costs of  [PCP][PPI] subcontracting : as actually incurred costs (‘ actual costs ’);

cost accounting practices (‘ unit costs ’). 
Personnel costs for  SME owners  or beneficiaries that are natural persons  not receiving a salary 
(see Article 6.2, Points B.1.4 and B.1.5) must be declared on the basis of the amount per unit set out 
in Annex 2a ( unit costs ); 
(c) for direct costs for  subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities  
[(exclu ding subcontracting costs covered by the unit cost under Point (f))]9: as actually incurred

6.2  Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above)  and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. Direct costs of  [PCP][PPI]  subcontracting  
B. Costs for related additional coordination and networking activities  
‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the a ction implementation and can therefore be attributed 
to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point B.4 below).  
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed dir ectly to it.

1. PCP/PPI subcontracting  costs  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility 
conditions — Calculation  
1.1 What?  This budget category covers  the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement  (i.e. the price paid 
and the related taxes; for VAT, see Article 6.5). 
Only costs of R&D services or innovative solutions subcontracted by the beneficiaries are 
eligible. Costs related to R&D and innovation activities carried out by the beneficiaries 
themselves  are NOT eligible in PCP/PPI actions . 
What not?  Indirect costs for the PCP subcontracting are not reimbursed.  
1.2 These costs must be declared as  actual costs (i.e. on the basis of the prices actually paid)  
(see Article 5.2(a) ).

B.1 Direct personnel costs for related additional coordination and networking activities  [(not covered 
by Point B.5]  
Types of eligible personnel costs  
B.1.1 Personnel costs are eligible, if they are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an 
employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the related additional coordination and 
networking activities ('costs for employees (or equivalent)'). They must be limited to salaries (including 
during parental leave), social security cont ributions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration , if 
they arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act).  
Beneficiaries that are non -profit legal entities15 may also declare as personnel costs additional 
remu neration  for personnel assigned to the related additional coordination and networking activities 
(including payments on the basis of supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if:  
(a) it is part of the beneficiary’s usual remuneration practices and is paid in a consistent manner 
whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required;  
(b) the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the 
beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used.  
'Additional remuneration' means any part of the remuneration which exceeds what the person would be paid 
for time worked in projects funded by national schemes.  
Additional remuneration for personnel assigned to the related additional coordination and networking 
activi ties is eligible up to the following amount:  
(a) if the person works full time and exclusively on the related additional coordination and networking 
activities during the full year: up to EUR 8  000; 
(b) if the person works exclusively on the related additional coo rdination and networking activities but 
not full -time or not for the full year: up to the corresponding pro -rata amount of EUR 8  000, or  
(c) if the person does not work exclusively on the related additional coordination and networking 
activities up to a pro -rata amount calculated as follows:  
{{EUR 8  000 
divided by  
the number of annual productive hours (see below)},  
multiplied by  
the number of hours that the person has worked on the action during the year }. 
B.1.2 The costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  with the beneficiary other than an 
employment contract are eligible personnel cost, if:  
(a) the person works under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way 
the work is organised, the tasks that are performed a nd the premises where they are performed;  
(b) the result of the work carried out belongs to the beneficiary (unless exceptionally agree otherwise), 
and 
(c) the costs are not significantly different from those for personnel performing similar tasks under an 
employm ent contract with the beneficiary.  
B.1.3 The costs of  personnel seconded  by a third party against payment  are eligible personnel costs if 
the conditions in Article 11.1 are met.  
B.1.4  Costs of owners of beneficiaries that are small and medium -sized enterpr ises (‘ SME  owners ’), who 
are working on the related additional coordination and networking activities and who do not receive a salary 
are eligible personnel costs, if they correspond to the amount per unit set out in Annex 2a multiplied by the 
number of ac tual hours worked on the related additional coordination and networking activities.

 B.1.5  Costs of ‘beneficiaries that are natural persons ’ not receiving a salary are eligible personnel costs, 
if they correspond to the amount per unit set out in Annex 2a multiplied by the number of actual hours 
worked on the related additional coordination and networking activities.   
[B.1.6 [ OPTION to be used  for trans -national access to research infrastructure: Personnel costs  for 
providing trans -national access to research infrastructure  are eligible only if also the conditions set out in 
Article 16.1.1 are met.] [ OPTION to be used for virtual access to rese arch infrastructure: Personnel costs 
for providing virtual access to research infrastructure are eligible only if also the conditions set out in 
Article 16.2 are met.] ] 
Calculation  
Personnel costs must be calculated by the beneficiaries as follows:  
{{hourl y rate  
multiplied by  
number of actual hours worked on the related additional coordination and networking activities},  
plus  
for non -profit legal entities: additional remuneration to personnel assigned to the related additional coordination and 
networking a ctivities under the conditions set out above (Point B.1.1) }. 
The number of actual hours declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 18).  
The total number of hours declared in EU or Euratom grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than 
the annual productive hours used for the calculations of the hourly rate. Therefore, the maximum number of 
hours that can be declared for the grant are:  
{number of annual productive hours for the year (see below)  
minus  
total number of hours declared by the beneficiary, for that person for that year, for other EU or Euratom grants} . 
The ‘ hourly rate ’ is one of the following:  
(a) for personnel costs declared as actual costs (i.e. budget categories B.1.1, B.1.2, B.1.3 [and B.1.6]): 
the hourly rate i s calculated per full financial year   as follows:  
{actual annual personnel costs (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
divided by  
number of annual productive hours} . 
using the  personnel costs and the number of annual productive hours for each  full financial year 
covered by the reporting period concerned. If a financial year is not closed at the end of the 
reporting period, the beneficiaries must use the hourly rate of the last closed financial year 
available.  
For the ‘number of annual producti ve hours’, the beneficiaries may choose one of the following:  
(i) ‘fixed number of hours’: 1  720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro -
rata for persons not working full time);  
(ii) ‘individual annual productive hours’: the total number of hours worked by the person in the 
year for the beneficiary, calculated as follows:  
{annual workable hours of the person (according to the employment contract, applicable collective 
labour agreement or national law)  
plus 
overtime worked  
minus  
absences (such as si ck leave and special leave)} .

 ‘Annual workable hours’ means the period during which the personnel must be working, at 
the employer’s disposal and carrying out his/her activity or duties under the employment 
contract, applicable collective labour agreement or national working time legislation.  
If the contract (or applicable collective labour agreement or national working time 
legislation) does not allow to determine the annual workable hours, this option cannot be 
used;  
(iii) ‘standard annual productive hours’: the standard number of annual hours generally applied 
by the beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices. 
This number must be at least 90  % of the ‘standard annual workable hours ’. 
If there is no applicable reference for the standard annual workable hours, this option 
cannot be used.  
For all options, the actual time spent on  parental leave by a person assigned to the related 
additional coordination and networking activities may be  deducted from the number of annual 
productive hours.  
As an alternative, beneficiaries may calculate the hourly rate per month , as follows:  
 
{actual monthly personnel cost (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
 
divided by  
 
{number of annual productive hours / 12} } 
 
using the personnel costs for each month and (one twelfth of) the annual productive hours 
calculated according to either option (i) or option (iii) above, i.e.:  
 
- fixed number of hours;  
 
- standard annual productive hours.  
 
Time spen t on parental leave may not be deducted when calculating the hourly rate per month. 
However, beneficiaries may declare personnel costs incurred in periods of parental leave in 
proportion to the time the person worked on the action in that financial year.  
 
If parts of a basic remuneration are generated over a period longer than a month, the 
beneficiaries may include only the share which is generated in the month (irrespective of the 
amount actually paid for that month).  
 
Each beneficiary must use only one op tion (per full financial year or per month) for during each full 
financial year;  
(b) for personnel costs declared on the basis of unit costs (i.e. budget categories B.1.1, B.1.2, B.1.4, 
B.1.5 [ and B.1.6 ]): the hourly rate is one of the following:  
- for SME owners or beneficiaries that are natural persons: the hourly rate set out in Annex 2a 
(see Points B.1.4 and B.1.5 above), or  
- for personnel costs declared on the basis of the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices: 
the hourly rate calculated by the b eneficiary in accordance with its usual cost accounting 
practices , if: 
- the cost accounting practices used are applied in a consistent manner, based on 
objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding;  
- the hourly rate is calculated using the actual p ersonnel costs recorded in the 
beneficiary’s accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget 
categories.

PCP/PPI > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.B  686 The costs must be incurred by the beneficiaries for additional coordination and networking 
activities that are related to the joint call for tender (e.g. coordination costs for preparing, 
managing monitoring and following -up the PCP/PPI pro curement, costs for other coordination and 
networking activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities) . 
Examples:  
1. The evaluation of the PCP or PPI tender is subcontracted or undertaken by in -house consultants under the 
responsibility of the consortium participants.  
2. Resources or equipment for testing innovative solutions are made available by end -users of the targe ted 
innovative solutions (in the form of action tasks undertaken by linked third parties or as in -kind contributions of 
third parties).  
3. Costs for validation and testing of solutions provided by the subcontractors .  
1.4 The same calculation rules  apply a s in the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA ). 
According to General Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme , the costs  of additional coordination 
and networking activities are eligible up to a maximum amount of 30 % (for PCP) /50%  (for PPI)  of 
the total requested grant amount. For each GA, this ceiling  is fixed in the GA (see Article  6.2.B ). 
Thus, the amount of EU funding for additional coordination and networking activities does NOT 
change, even if the costs actually incurred for PCP/PPI subcontracting end up being less than 
initially estimated ( e.g. if the buyers group is able to pr ocure at a better price than it had 
budgeted ).

1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
For PCP/ PPI actions, generally the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the General 
MGA (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, entities contributing  financially  to the joint procurement budget  can only participate as 
beneficiaries or linked third parties (NOT as other third parties involved in the action). They form 
the buyers group.  
Moreover, c ertain third party resources  (i.e. purchasing of goods, works or services (Article 10), 
in-kind contr ibutions (Articles 11 and 12)) are ONLY  allowed for additional coordination and 
networking activities . 
Example:  Equipment needed for testing and validating solutions is provided by a third party  as in -kind 
contribution.  
By contrast, subcontracting  (Article 13 ) is possible both for PCP/PPI subcontracting and related 
additional coordination and networking activities .  
Linked third parties  (Article 14) may participate in all activities under the action . 
In addition, PC P/PPI actions often have other interested third parties  (preferred partners), 
which are neither lead procurer nor part of the buyers group nor linked third parties nor third 
parties providing in -kind contributions, but which have a special interest in clos ely following the 
PCP and may therefore be mentioned in Annex 1 (e.g. entities involved in the related additional 
networking activities; other  potential buyers for the solutions that have expressed a special 
interest in the PCP/PPI).  ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources  to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
- use in -kind contrib utions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon link ed third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission] [Agency]  and the other 
beneficiaries for implementing the action.

 ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 [OPTION 1 for PCP: Rules for the pre -commercial procurement of research and development 
services  
13.1.1 The beneficiaries will award subcontracts  for the PCP  research and development services (‘ PCP 
R&D services ’) that are necessary to address the ‘ common challenge ’ set out in Annex 1. 
The subcontracts must be awarded as one single joint procurement by the beneficiaries concerned (i.e. the 
‘lead procurer’ and the ‘buyers group’) . 
The lead procurer must be a ‘contracting authority’ or ‘contracting entity’ as defined in Directives 
2004/18/ EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17 /EC (or 2014/25/EU).   
The buyers group must constitute a ‘total jointly committed budget’ for payment of the subcontracts.  
The ‘buyers group’, the ‘lead procurer’, the services to be subcontracted (for each implementation phase 
(‘PCP phase’)), their estimated costs and the estimated financial contribution per beneficiary to the ‘total 
jointly committed bud get’ must be set out in Annex 1 . The estimated costs of PCP subcontracting per 
beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2. 
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in w riting) from the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Article 37). ] 
The beneficiaries concerned  must — throughout the action —: 
- guarantee equal treatment of tenderers and subcontractors and avoid any restrictions or distortions 
of competition;   
- avoid any conflict of  interest (see Article 35);  
- allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional language(s) they may have 
chosen) . 
The subcontracts for pre -commercial procurement must provide for the following:  
- the ownership, by the subcontractors, of t he intellectual property rights on the results that they 
generate;  
- the right of the buyers to access results — on a royalty -free basis — for their own use;  
- the right of the buyers to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non -exclusive licences to 
third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable conditions — (without the right to 
sub-licence);  
- the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer back to the buyers the ownership of intellectual 
property generated by subcontractors duri ng the PCP, if subcontractors fail to commercially 
exploit the results within the period set out in the subcontract;  
- the right of the buyers to publish — at the time of the contract award notice — the identity of the 
winning tenderers and a project summary  provided by the winning tenderers, and to publish — 
after R&D has finished and after consulting the subcontractors — summaries of the results as well 
as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed the last phase of the PCP.  
The benefi ciaries concerned must ensure that the majority of the research and development work done by 
the subcontractor(s) (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
associated countries (‘ place of performance obligation ’).

- is promoted and advertised widely;  
- is summarised on the project website and other web -sites requested by the 
[Commission][Agency], together with a list of Q&As raised  during the open market 
consultation;  
(iii) prepare ‘ common tender specifications’  
(b) For the ‘ procurement/tendering stage ’: 
(i) Step 1 : make a ‘ contract notice ’, which  
- is published by the lead procurer in the  Official Journal of the European Union ( in 
English and any additional language(s) chosen by the buy ers group) ; 
- specifies that the procurement concerns a pre -commercial procurement that is 
exempted from Directives 2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17/EC (or 
2014/25/EU)26; 
- specifies a time -limit for receipt of tenders of at least two months;  
- allows for the submission of tenders in English (and any additional language(s) 
chosen by the buyers group);  
- is promoted and advertised widely;  
- indicates how potential tenderers can obtain the ‘request for tenders’;  
and the request for tenders  inviting all interested economic operators to tender, which:  
- identifies the lead procurer, the buyers group and, if applicable, third parties involved 
in the PCP;  
- informs potential tenderers about the outcome and list of Q&As of the market 
consultation (s ee above);  
- describes the common challenge (using functional or performance based specifications 
and taking into account the outcome of the open market consultation);  
- describes the process for the evaluation and selection of the tenders for the first PCP 
phase and the intermediate evaluations after each following PCP phase;  
- describes the practical set -up for the implementation of the subcontracts;  
- describes the minimum requirements that subcontractors must comply with during the 
PCP;

1. PCP subcontracting  
In PCP actions, the beneficiaries award PCP subcontracts for rese arch and development services 
that are necessary to address a common challenge  set out in Annex 1 (PCP R&D services) . ‘PCP - describes the arrangements for intellectual property rights, confidentiality, publicity 
(information about contract award and publication of summaries of R&D results) and 
rules on applicable law and dispute settlement;  
(ii) Step 2:  make an evaluati on of the tenders , ranking them, on the basis of the common tender 
specifications (see above), according to best value for money criteria and ensuring that the 
price corresponds to market conditions;  
(iii) Step 3:  award the subcontracts  to a minimum of three ten derers offering best value for 
money  and a price corresponding to market conditions . 
The framework agreements  (one agreement per selected tenderer) must be signed by the lead 
procurer and set out the terms and conditions that govern the specific contracts.  
The specific contracts  (one agreement per selected tenderer and PCP phase) must be signed 
by the lead procurer and set out the details of the PCP R&D services purchased by each 
buyer (in particular, their quantity and price);  
(iv) Step 4:  make a ‘ contract award notice ’  which is published — within 48 days after 
conclusion of the framework agreements — by the lead procurer in the  Official Journal of the 
European Union  (in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the buyers group);  
(c) For the ‘ contract i mplementation stage ’: 
(i)  monitor that the PCP R&D services are implemented in compliance with the objectives of the 
action set out in Annex 1;  
(ii) ensure compliance with the planning of resources  set out in Annex 1 and the estimated 
budget indicated in Annex 2;  
(iii) ensure payment of the subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries concerned must ensure that the right of the Commission [and the Agency] , the European 
Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) to exercise their rights under 
Articles 22 and 2 3 also towards the subcontractors.  
13.1.2 In addition, the beneficiaries concerned must ensure that their obligations under Articles 17.1, 18, 
34, 35, 37, 36, 38, 39 and 46 also apply to the subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries concerned must also ensure that  every prior information notice, contract notice or 
contract award notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer:  
 “This procurement receives funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and 
innovation pro gramme under the grant agreement No [number]). The EU is however not 
participating as a contracting authority in this procurement .”]

action task ). 
 
 
 
Characteristics of subcontracting:  
 Joint subcontracting by some or all of the beneficiaries and linked third partie s (buyers 
group ), with a joint procurement in 3 phases   
The buyers group  is the group that finances and undertakes together the joint PCP 
procurement  (i.e. normally the entities that need the purchased service/solution or central 
purchasing bodies) .  
For PCP/PPI actions, it must normally be made up of:  
 a minimum of 2 public procurers (i.e. ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting 
entities’ as defined in the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 
2014/25/EU120 )  
Any entity that fits  the definition of a contracting authority or contracting entity  
as defined in those Directives is considered a public procurer  — regardless of 
whether the EU public procurement Directives themselves apply or not.  
Example:  International entities such as European Research Infrastructure Consortia 
(ERICs) that fit as majority publ icly owned entities the public p rocurement Directive s 
definition of contracting authorities, but to which those Directives do not appl y, are 
considered public procurers that can participate in the buyers group and are eligible 
for funding under PCP/PPI actions . 
 that are established in two different EU Member States or  H2020  associated 
countries (see General Annex D to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
This is in addition to the general minimum requirements f or participation for Horizon 
2020 actions (i.e. minimum of 3 independent legal entities established in different 
EU Member States or H2020 associated countries; see General Annex es C and D  to 
the H2020  Work Programme  — unless the w ork programme /call allows for the 
participation of sole participants ). 
Procurers that are not public procurers, but provide services of public interest and share 
the same procur ement need may also be part of the buyers group.  
Example:  a group of a minimum of two public hospitals from two different EU Member 
States or H2020 associated countries could be joined by a private hospital or NGO (e.g. 
Médecins sans frontiers).  
The buyers group is NOT open to other types of procurers that are not providing 
services of public interest, even if they may share the same procurement need 
(e.g. private company procurers like IBM or EADS that are not providing hospital 
services cannot b e funded as buyers in the above example of a consortium of 
hospital procurers, even if they would be interested to procure the same software 
system as the hospital procurers) . 
Such o ther entities may be involved in the action as:

134, 30.4.2004, p. 114) .

134, 30.4.2004, p. 1).  
  For the purposes of the GA, the suppliers selected as a result of the PCP/PPI call for tender are 
considered ‘subcontractors’ and the contracts with them are ‘subcontracts’. They do NOT become 
beneficiaries of the GA.

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  692  beneficiaries /linked thir d parties responsible for other action tasks related 
additional coordination and networking activities (e.g. certification bodies, 
end-users)  
 third parties providing in -kind contributions  
if they are not potential suppliers of solutions sought for by the p rocurement 
and have no other type of conflict of interest.  
The PCP procurement is split in 3 phases (solution design, prototyping, original 
development and testing of a limited set of ‘first’ products or services) which are 
implemented via 3 different spec ific contracts (under the overall PCP framework 
agreement ). 
The buyers group must select multiple competing subcontractors (with a minimum of 3 
subcontractors for the first PCP phase). At the end of each phase, an intermediate 
evaluation will take place to identify the subcontractors that successfully completed the 
phase. A call -off will be made to select the sub contractors with the best value  for money 
offers for the next phase.  
In order to obtain a competitive supply chain as a result of the PCP, the buyers group 
must plan the budget distribution across the PCP phases so that there is enough budget 
for minimum 2 subcontractors in the last PCP phase 3.  
The tenders for the PCP call for tender must therefore contain:  
 a detailed offer for phase 1  
 the goals, plans and unit price conditions for phases 2 and 3.  
 Concerns R&D services addressing a common challenge  (i.e. a  specific procurement 
need that is part of the mid -to-long-term innovation plans of the buyers group).  
The common challenge may have several facets or building blocks, as long as all the 
beneficiaries in the buyers group share the need for all of them and  are willing to co -finance 
all of them.  
If the common challenge is split in several sub -challenges on which different vendors 
can compete, the minimum requirements of 3 subcontractors for phase 1 and 2 for 
phase 3 applies per sub -challenge, in order to ob tain a competitive supply chain for 
each sub -challenge.  
The procurement must be for an R&D services contract (i.e. a contract with the objective to 
provide R&D services; see also General Annex E to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
If required for the provisioning of the R&D services and required by the procurement 
need of the buyers group, the PCP may include the purchase of supplies (such as the 
limited volume  of prototypes or first test -products resulting from the R&D) . 
Example:  A traffic authority may need to acquire more environmentally -friendly tarmac 
that was developed and installed during the PCP on a test strip of the road, because the 
old tarmac was destroyed during the PCP in order to test the new variant and the traffic 
authority  needs to carry out further testing on the tarmac after the PCP is done . 
This does NOT extend to ‘quantity production ’ or ‘supply to establish commercial 
viability or to rec over research and development costs ’ (— otherwise it will not be a an 
R&D services contract and it will not be e xempted from the WTO GPA121). 
Supplies can  NOT constitute the majority of  the contract value . 
 All subcontracts paid from one common budget for the procurement ( common jointly -
committed budget )  
This budget is based on the financial commitments of the beneficiaries and linked third 
parties in the buyers group and must correspond to the call -for-tender -budget (i.e. the 
estimated procurement price = estimated direct costs of PCP subcontracting; see Articles 4  
and 6.2.A).  
                                            
121  PCP procurements are exempted from the WTO GPA ( since according to Annex IV of the WTO GPA R&D services 
are excluded from the scope of the GPA, i.e. both from the national treatment obligation and from the non-
discrimination obligation ).

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13. 1 693  Joint procurement procedure (i.e. joint call for tender, joint evaluation of offers and joint 
award) is coordinated and led by one beneficiary ( lead procurer ) 
The lead procurer may be part of the buyers group or not (i.e. it may also be a beneficiary  
that is NOT part of the buyers group).  
Example:  the lead procurer can be a central purchasing body that carries out the procurement for 
the buyers group, but does not contribute financially to the common jointly committed budget) . 
The lead procurer must be a ‘contracting authority’ or ‘contracting entity’ as defined in the 
EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU122. 
 Subcontracts  signed  by the lead procurer, in the name and on behalf of the buyers group  
The lead procurer must be mandated by the buyers group in the joint procureme nt 
agreement.  
The subcontracts to be signed are:  
 a framework contract with each selected subcontractor, covering the whole PCP  and  
 specific contracts with each selected subcontractor, for each PCP phase.  
 Subcontracts implemented  by the selected subcontractors ( PCP implementation)  
 Subcontractors  are paid either by the lead procurer or (pro rata) by the members of the 
buyers group (based on their individual financial contribution to the jointly -committed 
budget), depending on the choice of the con sortium when it submitted the estimated 
eligible costs  (see Article 4 ). 
PCP subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action (since the PCP subcontracting 
is the main goal of PCP actions).  
There can only  be one PCP per PCP action.  
 
 
 
2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Procurers, tasks and costs set out in 
Annexes 1 and 2 — No simplified approval procedure  
Annexes 1 and 2 must clearly identify the common challenge (types of R&D services to be 
procured), the lead procurer, the buyers group and the common jointly -committed budget and the 
estimated costs per beneficiary, already at the moment of the signature o f the GA. Any changes at 
a later stage (e.g. after the preparation stage of the project)  are only possible through an 
amendment; see Article 5 5). 
At the end of the preparation stage of the project, the consortium must confirm (in the 
periodic report; see Article 20.3 ) that the lead procurer has not changed and that the buyers 
group’s commitments to the common jointly -committed budget are still valid — or whether 
changes are needed, based on the feedback of the preparatio n stage of the project (e.g. the 
open market consultation) .

This includes R&D and operational activities (e.g. research, development, testing, certifying 
solutions, etc.) . 
The beneficiaries must require subcontractors to comply with this place of performance obligation, 
including when subcontractors subcontract work out themselves.  This obligation must however be 
clearly set out in the Framework Agreement (see below) . 
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Procurement procedure — Best value  for 
money  — Price corresponding to market conditions  
The beneficiaries must base the PCP subcontracts on the best value  for money (see Articles 10  
and 13 H2020 General MGA) .  
The tenders for the PCP call for tender must therefore contain:  
 a detailed offer for phase 1  
 the goals, plans and unit price conditions for phases 2 and 3.  
The offers for the call -offs for phase 2 and 3 must contain the detailed offer for phase 2 
and phase 3. The price offered for phase 2 and 3 must be based on the unit prices in the 
framework agreement  
The GA foresees additional rules, i.e. that:  
 the price m ust correspond to market conditions   
This means that the price must normally  be lower than the exclusive development price 
(since subcontractors obtain intellectual property ownership rights (IPRs)).  
AND 
 a specific procurement procedure  must be followed . 
The main elements of this procedure are as follows:  
 the buyers group and the lead procurer must formalise the PCP in a joint 
procurement agreement  that: 
 specifies the working arrangements for the joint procurement (e.g. division 
of tasks between the lead p rocurer and the buyers group; signature of the 
subcontracts, etc.)  
 sets out the financial arrangements (e.g. the contributions of each member 
of the buyers group to the common jointly -committed budget;  
arrangements for financial transfers between buyers group and/or lead 
procurer for carrying out the PCP)   
 specifies in -kind contributions provided by third parties  
 sets out other rights and obligations of the buyers group and lead procurer 
(e.g. allocation of IPR -related rights resulting from the PCP; commi tment to 
provide test environments)

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  695  the procurement must be pre ceded by an open market consultation  
This open market consultation must be implemented as a ‘technical dialogue’ as 
defined in the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU123.  
A prior information notice (PIN) must  be published in the Official Journal of 
European Union (OJEU)  and must be promoted widely, in particular via the 
websites specified by the Commission/Agency and the H2020 National Contact 
Points (N CPs). 
 the procurement must be based on common procurement specifications  
prepared by the buyers group and the lead procurer   
These specifications must be based on an analysis of the buyers group’s needs (i.e. 
the common challenge) and take into account the  feedback from the open market 
consultation (meaning that it should be refined based on this feedback, if needed).  
They must describe the functionality and performance requirements (including 
minimum requirements) that solutions must meet, rather than pre scribing a 
specific solution.  
 the buyers group and the lead procurer must publish a contract notice  to launch 
the request for tenders . 
The request for tenders does not have to be published. It can be provided on 
request.  
 the buyers group and the lead proc urer must jointly evaluate  the tenders and 
make a joint award  decision.  
Beneficiaries have to demonstrate — upon request — that the selection of the subcontractors 
complied with these rules.   
 
 
 
5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Minimum content of framework agreement 
and specific contracts  
The beneficiaries must conclude  a framework agreement  (with each selected subcontractor) 
which sets out the framework conditions for all 3 phases of the PCP implementation, including:  
 the practical set -up of the implementation of the subcontracts, in particul ar: 
 the number, duration and budget of the PCP phases  
 the minimum number of expected subcontractors per PCP phase

 the procedures for accounting and payments  
 an exclusion of contract renegotiations  
 the role and the rights and obligations of third parties involved in the 
implementation of the  subcontracts  
 the minimum requirements that subcontractors must comply with during the PCP 
implementation, in particular:  
 compliance with the definition of R&D services (see General Annex E to the H2020  
Work Programme ) 
 the obligation of the subcont ractors to ensure that the majority of the R&D work 
(including the work of the m ain researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
H2020 associated countries ( place of performance obligation)  
 additional national requirements, ethical and/or security requirements (if 
applicable)  
 the arrangements for intellectual property rights, in  particular : 
 the ownership, by the subcontractors, of the intellectual property rights on the 
results that they generate  
 the right of the buyers to access to use the results — on a royalty -free basis — for 
their own internal use (see General Annex E to the H2020  Work Programme ) 
 the right of the buyers to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non -
exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable 
conditions and without the right to sub -licence  
This right serves as a safeguard to ens ure a competitive supply chain (during or 
after the PCP action) in case of problems. It does NOT mean that every 
subcontractor will always and automatically be obliged to grant non -exclusive 
licenses to third parties to exploit its results.  
Examples (licences needed) : other providers working for the buyers group need access to  
the IPR to work for the buyers group; a PCP subcontractor abuse s its monopoly situation  
 the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer results (generated by 
subcontractors du ring the PCP implementation) to the buyers, if they fail to 
commercially exploit the results within the period set out in the framework 
agreement or use the results to the detriment of the public interest, including 
security interests (see General Annex E to the H2020  Work Programme ) 
This right serves as a safeguard to ensure commercial exploitation in the public 
interest, in case the subcontractors fail to do so themselves. It will be for 
exceptional cases.  
 the right of the buyers to publish:  
 at the time of the contract award notice: the identity of the winning tenderers and 
a project summary provided by the winning tenderers  
 after R&D has finished (and after consulting the subcontractors): summaries of the 
results as well as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully comp leted 
the last phase of the PCP  
The framework agreement remains binding for as long as subcontractors remain in the PCP 
(i.e. normally until the PCP subcontractor is no longer selected to continue for the next PCP 
phase).  
The beneficiaries must conclude  specific contracts  (with each selected subcontractor and for 
each PCP phase) must set out the specific conditions applicable to each PCP phase, in particular:

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  697  the details of the PCP R&D services purchased by each buyer  
 quantity and  
 price.  
The phase 1 specifi c contract is signed (together with the framework agreement) with all the 
subcontractors selected for phase 1. After phase 1 is finished, a call -off to award the phase 2 
specific contracts will be organised among the subcontractors who have successfully co mpleted 
phase 1. After phase 2 is finished, a call -off to award at least two phase 3 contracts will be 
organised among the subcontractors who have successfully completed phase 2.  
 
6. Additional cost eligibility condition: Compliance with the planning of resources  
To ensure compliance with the resource planning (as set out in Annex 1), the beneficiaries  must 
ensure the timely allocation of resource s in order to implement the PCP (including allocating 
sufficient time and resources for testing solutions in real-life operational end -user environments ). 
Example:  testing facilities or equipment to be provided by the buyers group (or other beneficiaries or third 
parties) . 
 
7. ‘Other obligation ’: Compliance with national procurement rules  
The EU public procuremen t Directives  2014/24/EU , 2014/25/EU124 and 2009/81/EC  do NOT 
apply  to the pre -commercial procurement of R&D services (because such services are 
exempted125).  
However, beneficiaries that are ‘ contracti ng authorities’  or ‘contracting entities’ (within the 
meaning of the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU126; see Article 13 
H2020 General MGA ) must implement the PCP procurement in compliance with provisions in 
national laws on public procurement  that may be applicable to this type of R&D services

1. PPI subcontracting  
For PPI actions, beneficiaries award PPI subcontracts for procuring the  innovative solutions  that 
are necessary to address the common challenge set out in Annex 1 (PPI innovative solution(s)) . 
‘PPI subcontract ’ thus means  a contract for the purchase of inn ovative solutions (identified in 
Annex 1 as an action task ). 
The requirements for PPI subcontracting are generally similar as for PCP subcontracting.  - describe the practical set -up for the implementation of the subcontracts, in particular:  
- the types of subcontracts that will be concluded with successful tenderers (in 
particular whether a framework agreement with multiple economic operators 
will be used or not);  
- describe the arrangements for intellectual property rights  
- describe the arrangements for liability for damages;  
(iv) Step 2:  make one (or se veral) evaluation(s) of the tenders  ranking them, on the basis of the 
common tender specifications (see above), according to best value for money  criteria and 
ensuring that the price corresponds to market conditions ; 
(v) Step 3:  award the subcontracts  to a minimum of three tenderers offering best value for money 
and a price corresponding to market conditions. ] 
(c) For the ‘ contract implementation stage ’: 
(i) monitor that the PPI innovative solutions are implemented compliance with the objectives of 
the action set out in Annex 1;  
(ii) ensure compliance with the planning of resources  set out in Annex 1 and the estimated 
budget indicated in Annex 2;  
(iii) ensure payment of the subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries concerned must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of 
Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 
23 also towards the subcontractors.  
13.1.2 In addition, the beneficiaries concerned must ensure that their obligations under Articles  17.1 18, 34, 
35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 46 also apply to the subcontractors.  
Beneficiaries acting as contracting authorities within the meaning of Directive 2004/18/EC (or 
2014/24/EU) or as contracting entities within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC  (or 2014/25/EU) must 
comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.  
The beneficiaries concerned must also ensure that every  prior information notice, contract notice or 
contract award notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer:  
 ‘This procurement receives funding under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
programme  under the grant agreement No [ number ]). The EU is however not participating as a contracting 
authority in this procurement .’]

of Directive 2004/17/EC replaced by Article 50(b) of Directive 2014/25/EU.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  PCP/PPI MGA  
PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  701 However, PPI subcontracting has the following  specificities : 
The PPI procurement covers 2 phases (deployment and operational validation)  — but there is no 
requirement to split the PPI procurement for those 2 phases in different contracts . 
The beneficiaries may choose between implementing one single  or several coordinated  PPI 
procurements.  
For joint p rocurement s, there is one joint PPI call for tender launched by the lead procurer 
and one joint evaluation of offers.  
For coordinated procurement s, there are several separate PPI procurements carried out 
individually by the different procurers in the buye rs group.   
Moreover, t he buyers group may select one or more subcontractors.  
The common challenge does NOT concern R&D services, but the supply  of innovative goods or 
services . The buyers group acts as a launch customer  (early adopter) of innovative solutions that 
are not yet available on a large -scale commercial basis.  
PPI cannot include the procurement of R&D. Only procurement procedures that do not involve 
the procurement of R&D can be used for PPI (e.g. innovation partnership procedure) .  
Each PPI  action focuses on one concrete common challenge and requires innovative solutions 
that are to a significant extent similar across countries, making it sensible to procure them 
together (i.e. the core functionality and performance characteristics must be t he same; there 
may be additional local functionalities — due to differences in the local context of each 
individual procurer).  
Also, t here is a common budget for the procurement ( common jointly -committed budget ) only 
if the buyers group would like to centr alise payments. Each buyer may alternatively manage a 
separate budget for the innovative solutions it buys.  
Finally, t he subcontracts are not necessarily  signed  by the lead procurer ; there is not 
necessarily a framework agreement . 
The buyers group may choo se between direct subcontracts or a framework agreement with 
specific contracts (with each selected subcontractor).  
For joint procurement s: 
 the buyers group may mandate the lead procurer — in the joint procurement agreement — 
to sign the framework agreements and/or the specific contracts/direct subcontracts  
 if there is no mandate, the general rule is that:  
 framework agreement(s) must be signed by all members of the buyers group together   
 specific contracts must be signed by each buyer individually (for the innovative 
solution(s) it buys).  
PPI subcontracting is not restricted to a limited part of the action (since the PPI subcontracting is 
the main goal of PPI actions).  
 
 
 
 
 
  Article 13.1 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 13.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
Article 13.1.2).

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  702 2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Procurers, tasks and costs set out in 
Annexes 1 and 2 — No simplified approval procedure  
Annexes 1 and 2 must clearly identify the common challenge (type of innovative solutions to be 
procured), the lead procurer, the buyers group, and the estimated costs per beneficiary, already 
at the moment of the signature of the GA. Any changes at a later  stage (e.g. after the preparation 
stage of the project)  are only possible through an amendment; see Article 55 ).  
At the end of the preparation stage of the project, the consortium must confirm (in the periodic 
report; see Article 20.3 ) that lead procurer has not changed and that the buyers group’s 
commitments to the budget for carryi ng out the PPI are still valid — or whether changes are 
needed, based on the feedback of the preparation stage of the project (e.g. the op en market 
consultation) . 
For PPI subcontracting, t here is NO simplified approval procedure  (contrary to the subcontracting 
of related additional coordination and networking activities; see Article 13.2 ). 
 
3. Additiona l cost eligibility condition: Procurement procedure — Best value  for 
money  — Price corresponding to market conditions  
Like for PCP subcontracts:  
 the beneficiaries must base the PPI subcontracts on the best price -quality ratio   
 the price must correspond to market conditions   
AND 
 a specific procurement procedure  must be followed.  
The main elements of this procedure are as follows:  
 the buyers group and lead procurer must formalise the PPI in a joint 
procurement agreement  that: 
 specifies the working arrangement s (e.g. division of tasks between the lead 
procurer and the buyers group; use of a framework agreement or not; 
signature of subcontracts, etc.)  
 sets out the financial arrangements (e.g. budget for the procurement 
committed per member of the buyers group;  arrangements for financial 
transfers — if any — between members of the buyers group and/or lead 
procurer for carrying out the PPI)  
 specifies in -kind contributions provided by linked third parties  
 sets out other rights and obligations of the buyers group and lead procurer 
(e.g. IPR -related rights, commitments to provide test environments)   
 the procurement must normally be precede d by an open market consultation  (— 
unless the PPI is limited to procur ing a limited set of prototypes or test products 
resulting from a p revious  PCP action carried out by the same procurers).  
The open market consultation must be implemented as a ‘technical dialogue’ as 
defined in the EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU127.

 whether verifica tion of the market’s readiness to deliver the requested 
quality/price ( e.g. via conformance testing, certification or quality 
labelling of solutions ) is planned before committing to procure and, if so, 
at what point in the process.   
 the buyers group and th e lead procurer must prepare ‘ common procurement 
specifications   
The specifications must be based on an analysis of the buyers group’s needs (i.e. 
the common challenge) and — if there was an open market consultation — take 
into account the feedback from th at cons ultation.  
They must describe the functionality and performance requirements that solutions 
must meet, rather than prescribing a specific solution.  
 the buyers group and the lead procurer must publish a contract notice  to launch 
the request for tender s  (— unless the PPI is limited to procuring a limited set of 
prototypes or test products resulting from a previous  PCP action carried out by the 
same procurers)  
The request for tenders  should specify  the arrangements for intellectual property 
rights (see below)  and the buyers’ right to publish summaries of the results and 
the subcontractors’ identities.  
The request for tenders does not have to be published. It can be provided on 
request.   
For PPI limited to procuring a limited set of prototypes or test pro ducts resulting 
from a previous  PCP action carried out by the same procurers , a request for offers 
from at least 3 providers (including the providers that successfully completed the 
last PCP phase in the PCP action) is suffic ient. 
 the buyers group and the lead procurer must jointly evaluate  the tenders and 
make a joint award  decision.  
In case of framework contracts/agreements , there may be multiple award decisions 
for different specific contracts that may be taken at the appropriate points in time 
during t he framework contract/agreement by the procurers concerned.

contracts where different parts of the solution corresponding to different lots that need to be 
deployed at different times and/or by different procurers.  
Beneficiaries have to demonstrate — upon request — that the selection of the subcontractor 
complied with these rules.  
 
 
 
 
4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Minimum content of subcontracts  
The beneficiaries must conclude subcontract(s ) that specify:  
 the practical set -up of the implementation of the subcontracts, in particular:  
 the process for monitoring of on -going work and reporting obligations of 
subcontractors  
 the role and the  rights and obligations of third parties involved in the PPI 
 the procedures for accounting and payments  
 an exclusion of contract renegotiations  
 the minimum requirements that subcontractors must comply with during the PPI 
implementation, in particular:  
 implementation of the innovative solutions in accordance with  the objectives of the 
action  
 additional national requirements, ethical and/or security requirements (if 
applicable)  
 the arrangements for intellectual property rights (IPRs), in particular:  
 the ownership by the subcontractor(s) of the intellectual property  rights on the 
results they generate  — except  in duly justified cases (e.g. if the party that 
produced the results is not able to exploit them)  
The intellectual property provisions described here are the minimum requirements that 
must be respected. Beneficiaries may — if appropriate — specify additional intellectual 
property provisions (e.g. regarding access to background, licensing etc.)  if these : 
 do not conflict with their obligations under other Articles and  
 maximise the incentives for both beneficiaries and subcontractors to use, 
widely exploit and commercialise the results  
 the right of the buyers to publish:  
 at the time of the contract award notice: the identity of the winning tenderer(s) 
and a project su mmary provided by the winning tenderer(s)  
 after the contract(s) has(have) finished (and after consulting the subcontractor(s)):  
summaries of the results as well as the identities of the subcon tractor(s)  
 the specific condition s for each buyer, in particular:  
 details of the innovative solutions purchased by each buyer  
 quantity and

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1  705  price.  
If the beneficiaries  choose a framework agreement with specific contracts (for the innovative 
solutions procured by each buyer), the specific conditions for each buyer must be in the specific 
contracts (and the rest in the framework agreement).  
 
5. Additional cost eligibility  condition: Compliance with the planning of resources  
To ensure compliance with the resource planning (as set out in Annex 1), the beneficiaries  must 
ensure the timely allocation of resources in order to implement the PPI  (including allocating 
sufficient t ime and resources for testing solutions in real -life operational end -user environments ). 
Example:  testing facilities or equipment to be provided by the buyers group (or other beneficiaries or third 
parties) . 
 
6. ‘Other obligation ’: Compliance with national  procurement rules  
Contrary to PCP, the EU public procurement Directives  2014/24/EU , 2014/25/EU128  and 
2009/81/EC   normally apply  to PPI procurements.  
Therefore, the beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ (within the 
meaning of Directives 2014/24/EU  and 2014/25/EU129; see Article 13 H2020 General MGA ) must 
— like in the General MGA  — also comply with the applicable national law on public 
procurement .

1. Subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities  
For the subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities , the same rules 
apply as in the General MGA (see Article 1 3 H2020 General MGA ). 13.2 Rules for subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities  
13.2.1 If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may award subcontracts for the ‘related 
additional coordination and networking activities’ described in Annex 1. 
The beneficiaries must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
[OPTION:  In addition, if the value of the subcontract to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries 
must comply with the following rules: […].28] 
The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the 
total estimated costs of subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2. The 
[Commission] [Agency]  may however approve subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 and 2 without 
amendment according to Article 55, if:  
- they are specifically justified in the periodic or final technical report, and  
- they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Co mmission] [Agency]  (see Article 37).]  
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
their subco ntractors.  
13.2.2 In addition, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38, and 46 also 
apply to the subcontractors.  
Beneficiaries acting as contracting authorities within the meaning of Directive 2004/18/EC (or 
2014/24// EU) or as contracting entities within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC  (or 2014/25/EU) must 
comply with the applicable national law  on public procurement.  
13.3 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1 or 13.2.1, the costs related to the 
subcontract concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.2 or 13.2.2, the grant may be reduced (see 
Article 43) . 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
28 If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality taking into account 
the value of the contracts and the relative size of the EU contributions in relation to the total cost of the action a nd the risk. Specific rules 
must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable prov isions 
should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher t han EUR  60 000. The authorising officer 
may set a threshold higher than EUR  60 000 on the basis of a risk assessment.

Before  the end of the action, these are only technical reports, with information on the technical 
implementation.  
List of documents for the technical  reports:  
 explanation of the work carried out  
 overview of the progress  The beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  must declare all eligible costs, even if — for 
actual costs, unit costs and  flat-rate costs  — they exceed the amounts indicated in the

 questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested)  
 call for tender documents (including contract notice, invitation to tender and procurement 
contracts)  
 report on outcome of the preparation phase (e.g. open market consultation)  
 commitment on availability of funds  (Annex 7)  
This ensures that the PCP/PPI subcontracting costs are covered.  
 statement on the use of the previous pre -financing instalment (Annex 8)  
NO financial reporting during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final report).  The 
coordin ator only  has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre -financing 
instalment (which includes also the request for further pre -financing payments; only the first pre -
financing payment is automatic;  see Annex 7 ) 
How?  Each periodic  report must be prepared  by the coordinator  and the other beneficiaries  
together , directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal ). 
 
2. Reporting periods  
Normally, PCP/PPI actions are divided into 2 reporting periods (with 2 pre-financing payments; see 
Article 21 ). The first reporting period corresponds to the preparation of the joint procurement; the 
second repor ting period corresponds to the implementation  and fol low-up of the joint 
procurement .  
Actions will exceptionally be divided into 3 reporting periods (with 3 pre-financing payments), if 
the Commission/Agency does not have s ufficient payment credits to pay the entire amount as a 
second pre -financing payment.   
The first (and, if there are 2 pre-financing payments, also the second) reporting period triggers a 
periodic report.

The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The [Commission] [Agency]  will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
Article 58 ) or from 10 days before the starting date of t he action (see Article 3 ), whichever is the latest  — 
make a first pre -financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], 
except if Article 48 applies.  
From this amount, an amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in wo rds)], corresponding to 5  % of 
the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the [Commission][Agency]  and transferred into 
the ‘Guarantee Fund ’. 
The [Commission][Agency]  will — within 60 days after receiving the request (see Article 20 ) — make  a 
second pre -financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ] except 
if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
[OPTION in case of three pre -financing payments : The [Commission][Agency] will — within 60 days 
after receiving the reques t (see Article 20 ) — make a third pre -financing payment to the coordinator of EUR 
[insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. ] 
If the statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment  shows that less than 70  % of the previous 
payment  has been used to cover the costs of the action, the amount of the new pre -financing to be paid will 
be reduced by the difference between the 70  % threshold and the amount used.  
[OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary:  The parts of the  pre-financing payments related to the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) ([ insert amounts  (insert amounts in words) ] are not paid to the coordinator, but 
kept by the [ Commission][Agency] for the JRC.] 
21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
Not applicable  
[…] 
21.5 Notification of amounts due  
When making payments, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify to the coordinator the amount due, 
specifying whether it concerns the second [or third]  pre-financing payment or the payment of the balance.

PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 >  Section 2 > Article 21  714  
 
 
 
 
 
1. Payments to be made — No interim payments  
Normally, PCP/ PPI  actions are divided into 2 reporting periods (see Article 20.2 ) with 2 pre-
financing payments  (— unless t he action is exceptionally divided into 3 reporting periods with 3 
pre-financing payments because of insufficient payment credits) . 
There are NO  interim payments, but the second pre -financing payment (after the end of the first 
reporting period, i.e. after  the evaluation of the preparation stage of the PCP/PPI procurement) 
provides beneficiaries with the necessary funds to launch the PCP/PPI procurement.  
The second (or third) pre -financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requ ested by the 
coordinator v ia a statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment  (see Article 20 ). 
In this statement, the beneficiaries must simply declare how much of the previous pre -
financing was used up, not how much  costs were incurred  (since PCP/ PPI pre -financing is NOT 
linked to financial reporting).  
The balance is paid when the action ends  (after the submission of financial reports) . 
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
Pre-financing payment  
How much? Typically  (and depending on the availability of EU budget credits) , the amounts of 
the pre-financing payments for PCP/ PPI actions are as follows:  
 for the first pre -financing payment : the percentage of the maximum grant amount  
foreseen for the additional networking a nd coordination activities related to the preparation 
of the call for tender  
 for the second pre -financing payment : if needed, up to 100% of the remaining part of the 
grant  ( minus the amount of the first pre -financing payment) . 
If the GA provides for a thi rd pre -financing payment, the amounts will be adapted.  
 
 
  The second/third pre -financing payment will be reduced , if — according to the statement on use of the 
previous pre -financing instalment — the previous pre -financing was not fully  used : 
 if 70% or more of the first/second  pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing is 
paid in full  
 if less than 70% of the first/second pre -financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing 
will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actual ly used and 
70%.  
 
 
 
. 
 
 For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.  
In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 45.

22.1.2  Right to carry out reviews  
The [Agency or the] Commission  may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry out 
reviews on the proper implementation of the act ion (including assessment of deliverables and reports), 
compliance with the obligations under the Agreement and continued scientific or technological relevance of 
the action.  
Reviews may be started up to  two years after the payment of the balance . They wi ll be formally notified 
to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
notification.  
If the review is carried out on a third party (see Articles 10 to 16), the beneficiary concerned must inform 
the third party.  
The [Agency or the]  Commission  may carry out reviews directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will inform the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the 
identity of the extern al persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds of 
commercial confidentiality.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must provide — within the deadline requested — any information 
and data in addition to deliverables a nd reports already submitted (including information on the use of 
resources). The [Agency or the]  Commission  may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it 
directly.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in m eetings, including with 
external experts.  
For on-the-spot reviews, the beneficiaries must allow access to their sites and premises, including to 
external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available.  
Information provi ded must be accurate, precise and complete and in the format requested, including 
electronic format.  
On the basis of the review findings, a ‘ review report ’ will be drawn up.  
The [Agency or the]  Commission  will formally notify the review report to the coor dinator or beneficiary 
concerned, which  has 30 days to formally notify observations (‘ contradictory review procedure ’).

What?  EJP Cofund funds : 
 a joint programme of activities by coordinated national research and innovation 
programmes  (— ranging from research and innovation to coordination and networking 
activities and including training, dissemination and financial support to third parties) .  
EJP does NOT fund individual projects or coordination networks.  
Normally, EJP Cofund grants are multi -beneficiary grants; exceptionally they can be mono -
beneficiary grants for ‘sole participants’ (see General Annex D  to the H2020  Work Programme ). 
EJP Cofund actions are funded in all Parts of H orizon 2020 and the Euratom Research and Training 
Programme  (e.g. NFRP7 –2015; Fusion programme Cofund action (FEJP) in section B.1 Euratom 
Work Programme 2014 -2015).

1. Action d uration  
For EJP Cofund actions, the action duration is normally 60 months .  
If implementation of the action is justifiably delayed, the consortium may req uest an extension 
(i.e. request an amendment extending the action duration; see Article 55 ). The duration can  
however NOT exceed 84 months.  
 
 ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The EJP Cofund MGA uses the same budget categories as the General MGA.  
Budget categories of the EJP Cofund MGA:  
 direct personnel costs  
 costs for employees (or equivalent)  
 costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
 costs of personnel seconded b y a third party against payment  
 costs for SME owners without salary  
 costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary  
 direct costs of subcontracting  
 direct costs of providing financial support to third parties (if option applies)  
 other direct costs  
 travel costs and related subsistence allowances  
 equipment costs  
 costs of other goods and services  
 capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastr ucture  
 indirect costs  
 specific categories of costs (if option applies).  
For the FEJP action,  there are moreover 3 additional specific cost categories:  
 costs for mobility of personnel  
 costs for fellowships for researchers  
 access costs for research  infrastructure . 
Thus, the EJP Cofund MGA does NOT have:  
 personnel costs for providing trans -national access to research infrastructure.  
 
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).  
 
. 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED  BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
party)]  and  budget category  (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14] ). [OPTION  to be used if Article 9 or 14a applies: 
It also shows the estimated costs of the beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see  Article 
9)[and][international partners (see Article 14a ].]

For EJP Cofund actions, the cost forms  are in principle the same  as in the  General MGA  (i.e. 
actual costs, unit costs and flat rate costs; see Article  5 H2020 General MGA ). 
For the FEJP action, t here are however  3 specific unit costs  for category F  ‘specific cost

1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category.  
The EJP Cofund MGA uses in principle the same  budget categories  (covering the same types of 
costs)  as the General MGA and the same eligibility c onditions and calculation rules  apply 
(see Article  6 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, EJP grants have the following  specificities : 
 for category A  ‘personnel costs’  
Costs of students, PhDs and other researchers (under scholarship, internship or 
similar agreement)  — Are eligible  even if the agreement is training -oriented (or work -
oriented but with a non -negligeable training component), the costs fulfil the eligibility 
conditions set out in Article 6 and Annex 1 explicitly includes the  training  activities.  
 for category D.2 ‘equipm ent costs’  
There is a special cost category for the FEJP action: full purchase cost for JET equipment 
(see below) .  
 for category F ‘specific cost categories’  ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
[…] 
6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible  
Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
below for each of the following budget categories:  
A. direct personnel costs;  
B. direct costs of subcontracting;  
C. [OPTION 1 to be used if Article 15 applies: direct costs of providing financial support to third 
parties; ] [OPTION 2:  not applicable ;] 
D. other direct costs;  
E. indirect costs;  
F. [OPTION 1 for specific unit costs: [insert name(s) of specific cost category(ies )16]][OPTION 2: 
not applicable] . 
 
‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point E below).  
‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
attributed directly to it.  
[…] 
 
16 Insert pre cise name of the costs (as in the Commission decision authorising the use of the unit cost/  lump -sum). For example: ‘access

costs under category D.2 ‘equipment costs’ (see Article 6.2. D.2 H2020 General MGA ):  
one of the following:  
− either depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets  
− or purchase costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets (if option applies)  
AND: 
− costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets  
− costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets contributed in -kind against 
payment . 
1.1 Equipment costs: Cost of purchasing equipment, infrastructure or other assets to be 
included in the JET facilities  
1.1.1  What?  This budget category covers  the full purchase costs of equipment, infrastructure or 
other assets to be included in JET facilities (not only the depreciation costs for the relevant 
periodic report) . 
1.1.2  Equipment costs must be declared  as actu al costs (see Article 5.2(d) ). 
1.1.3  The costs must comply with the following eligibility  conditions :  
 fulfil the general conditions  for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the 
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, 
etc.; see Article 6.1(a) )  
 concern equipment, infrastructure or other assets (new or second -hand) to be incl uded 
in JET facilities  
‘JET’ means Joint European Torus, i.e. the experimental device for studying fusion 
relevant plasmas in operation at Culham, UK.  
‘JET facilities’ include, in particular, the JET device and auxiliary facilities (such as the 
neutral be am test bed, the remote handling facility, and the active gas handling 
system) .  
 be identified in Annex 1  and in the annual work plans  approved by the 
Commission ( see Article 19.1 ). 
 be capitalised or expensed  by the beneficiary in accordance with international 
accounting standards and the beneficiary’s usual accounting practice  
 fulfil the additional cost eligibility  conditions  set out in  Article 10.1.1.  
Costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets (incl uding depreciation costs) that are declared 
under this option, may not also be declared by another beneficiary or under another budget 
category. They may also not be declared under another EU or Euratom grant or contract ( see also 
Article 6.5(b) ). 
1.1.4. There is no specific calculation  method. The costs must correspond to the eligible costs 
actually incurred (i.e. the amount paid by the beneficiary for the supply of the equipment).

Calculation  
For this budget category, in principle the same rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article  6 
H2020 General MGA ).        
For the  Fusion programme EJP Cofund action (FEJP),  there are  however 3 additional specific cost 
categor ies set out in Decision C(2013) 8201132 available : 
 costs for mobility of personnel  
 costs for fellowships for researchers  
 access c osts for  research infrastructure.  
 
 
 
 
1.1 Specific cost category – costs for mobility of personnel (F.2)  
1.1.1  What?  This budget category covers  direct costs for FEJP secondments of personnel (
 
irrespective of their duration) to another research institution, in a location other than their normal 
place of employment , by providing for:  
 a daily subsistence allowance  
 a monthly subsistence allowance  and 
 a monthly family allowance .

It may also be used for secondments of personnel provided in -kind by a third party  free of charge .  
It may NOT be used for mobility costs for personnel contributed in -kind against payment  (see

What not?  This budget category does not cover  the salary costs of the seconded personnel , other 
direct costs for the mobility (e.g. extra costs incurred for the activities of the seconded persons)  or 
direct costs for managing the mobility. Such costs can be declared unde r another budget category 
(i.e. category A ‘ personnel costs’ or D.3 ‘other goods and services ’; see Article 6.2.A, 6.2.D .3). 
It also does not cover indirect costs for managing the secondments. Such costs can be declared

 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the 
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(b) ) 
 be incurred for the secondment of personnel (employed by the beneficiary or made 
available as an in -kind contribution by a third party) to:  
 a location other than the seconded person’s place of employment and  
 one of the following:  
 an organisation where the researcher takes part in experiments using a 
research  infrastructure of that organisation  
 another beneficiary , the ITER Organization or  the European Joint 
Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy (Fusion for

 for the family allowance: be incurred for personnel accompanied during the 
secondment by dependent children (between 5 and 18 years), enrolled in regular full -
time attendance at a primary  or secondary school that charges tuition fees (registration 
and attendance fees) .

EJP Cofund > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.F  731  the base amount  is the time between the departure time and the return time 
of the main form of transport used for the secondment   
 to thi s amount, add the following for each leg of the journey ( outward and 
return):  
 for train travel : a maximum of 30 minutes for each leg   
 for air travel : a maximum of 2 hours for each leg.   
NO extra time is added if the journey is by any means of transport other than 
train or plane.  
Example : 
The seconded person le aves her/his  normal place of employment on a flight departing at 9:35 on 
Monday 3 April and returns on a flight that arrives at 10:35  on Wednesday 5 April.  
This amounts  to 3 days of secondment : Wednesday 5 April is also counted as exceeding 12 hours 
(00:00 until the flight arrival time of 10:35, plus 2 hours extra time = 12 hours 35 minutes).  
 for the monthly subsistence allowance:  
amount per unit ( see table above   x  count. coef. corr. )  x  number of actual months of secondment  
 for the family allowance:  
amount per unit ( EUR 252, 81)  x  number of actual months of secondment   x  number of dependent 
children  
The family allowance is paid for each full month of secondment in which the dependent 
child is between 5 and 18 years.  
‘Month of secondment ’ means each full month  of secondment (NO pro-rata payments for 
partial months of secondment ).  
A full month can be one of the following two : 
 a calendar month  (e.g. 1 to 31 July inclusive)  or  
 a month from the  date the secondment starts  until the same date the 
following month (excluding the last day,  e.g. 3 July to 2 August ). 
If a secondment starts o n 31 January (or on 30 or 31 January in a leap year), it is 
considered to have been completed at midnight on 28 February  (since there is 
never a 30 February and a 29 February only in leap years).  
 
Examples  for calculat ing unit costs for mobility of personnel : 
1. An employee with primary employment in Rome is seconded to the joint programme unit in Garching (Munich), 
Germany, from 1 January 2015 to 31 August 2016 (20 months). He is accompanied by one 6 -year-old child, who is 
enrolled in a fee -paying p rimary school.  
Daily subsistence allowance: 609 days * EUR 127 ,65 = EUR 77  738,85 
Monthly subsistence  allowance: 20 months * EUR 382, 92 (800< distance >1  300) = EUR 7  658,40 
Subtotal = EUR 85  697,25 
* correction coefficient  (2016)  of 106.0 % (Germany Munich) = EUR 9 0 839,09 
Family allowance: 20 months * EU R 252, 81 = EUR 5  056,20 
Total declared unit costs: EUR 95 895, 29 
2. An employee with primary employment in Madrid is sent to a scientific project meeting at Culham, UK, for three 
days.   
Daily subsiste nce allowance: 3 days * EUR 127,65 = EUR 382, 95 
* correction coefficient (2016) of 127,7 % (Culham, UK) = EUR 489,03

1.2.1  What?  This budget category covers  direct costs for FEJP researcher fellowships , by 
providing for   
 a monthly living allowance, with full social security coverage and unit costs (including all 
compulsory deductions) in accordance with applicable national legislation (gross amount)  
 a monthly mobility allowance to cover additional costs, e.g. relating to travel and 
accommodation  and  
 a monthly family allowance to reduce family -related obstacles to researcher mobility.

costs can be declared under another budget category (i.e. category D.3 ‘other goods and 
services ’; see Article 6.2.D .3). 
It also does not cover indirect costs for managing the fellowships. Such costs can be declared 
under another budget category (i.e.  category E  ‘indirect costs’; see Article 6.2.E ).

equivalent status to a marriage recognised by the legislation of the country where the 
relationship was formalised) or dependent children who are being actually maintained 
by the researcher.  
1.2.4  They must be calculated  as follows:

1.3 Specific cost category – access costs for research infrastructure  (F.2)   
1.3.1  What?  This budget category covers  direct and indirect access costs for providing FEJP 
access to research infrastructure (i.e. equipment and running costs of the installation and the 
costs for logistical, technological and scientific sup port to users’ access , including costs for ad -hoc 
training needed by users to use the installation  and for preparatory and closing activities needed 
to work  on the installation ). 
 
It may also be used for access to infrastructure  provided by a third party  free of charge . 
It may NOT be used for infrastructure contributed in -kind against payment  (see below ). 
What not?  Travel and subsistence costs for users to get access are not included in the access 
costs.  (These  costs can be reimbursed separately,  under category  D.1 ‘travel ’; see Article 
6.2.D.1 ).  
1.3.2 If they are declared under this budget category, these costs must be declared as the unit 
cost calculated in accordance with  Decision C(2013) 8201141 and set out  in Annex es 2 and  2a of 
the GA . 
The precise unit cost is not pre -fixed by the Decision; it must be established for each  access 
provider and  installation — before signature of the FEJP GA .  
The ‘unit of access ’ to the installation  must be identified (i.e. the unit  used to measure the 
total quantity of access that the installation provides to its users ) 
The ‘amount per unit  of access ’ (EUR/unit of access) must be  calculated according to the 
following formula : 
Amount per unit  = average annual total access cost  (over past two years142) 
  average annual total quantity of access  (over past two years143) 
The averages must be based on:  
 the beneficiary’s certified  or auditable historical data  
 costs allocated to the installation according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
practices  and

costs_fusion_en.pdf . 
142  In exceptional and duly justified cases, the Commission may agree to a different reference period.  
143  In exceptional and duly justified cases, the Commission may agree to a different reference period.  
 This specific budget category must be distinguished from the general budge t category D.4 
'capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure'  (see Article 6.2.D.4 H2020 
General MGA ). FEJP beneficiaries that that have obtained a positive ex -ante assessment may opt between 
declaring costs under:  
 category D.4 ‘capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure’  
or 
 category F.2 ‘access cost for research infrastructure’.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019 EJP Cofund MGA  
EJP Cofund > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.F  735  a period excluding times when the installation was not usable (out of order, under repair or 
undergoing  long-term maintenance).  
‘Total quantity  of access ’ means the units of access annually provided by the installation  for the 
purposes of the activities referred to in Annex 1 of the GA (for the reference period years N -1 and N -
2). 
‘Total access costs’  is calculated on the basis of the following categories of eligible costs:  
 direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to the 
installation’, as recorded in the certified or auditable profit -and-loss accounts of the 
reference period (years N -1 and N -2) for : 
 personnel costs of administrative, technical and s cientific staff directly assigned to 
keep the installation functioning normally and to support the users  
 costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating 
and testing ) specifically awarded to keep the installation func tioning normally  
 costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the users’ research 
work 
 costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance 
costs, quality control and certification, upgrading to national and/or EU quality, 
safety or security standards specifically incurred for the functioning of the 
installation  
 costs of energy power and water supplied for the installation  
 costs of general services specifically included in the access services provided 
(e.g. library costs, shipping costs)  
 costs of software licences, internet connections or other electronic services for data 
management and computing where needed to provide access services  
 costs of specific scientific services included in the access provided o r needed for the 
provision of access  
 depreciation costs of equipment, buildings and other assets (new or second -hand) 
that are part of the installation and were not purchased or built using EU/Euratom 
funds  
 renting or leasing the equipment, buildings and other assets that are part of the 
installation  
Costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices are 
acceptable for personnel  (average personnel costs)  and internally invoiced goods and 
services — if this is the normal practice of the beneficiary.   
 indirect costs  for providing access to the installation equal to 2 5 % of the eligible direct 
costs, minus  any costs of subcontracting (i.e. costs of contracts for maintenance and 
repair,  installation management, scientific ser vices and  other electronic services)  
and excluding : 
 depreciation costs of infrastructure purchased or built using EU funds  (Those costs 
are not eligible; see also Article 6.5(b) ) 
 travel and subsistence costs  for users . 
The unit cost can be changed only via an amendment to the agreement (see Article 55) . 
As already mentioned above, a ccess costs for installations contributed in -kind must be declared as 
actual costs under another budget category (i.e. category D.3 ‘other goods and services ’; see 
Article 6.2.D.3 ).  
Before  signature of the FEJP GA, the beneficiaries can still opt for declaring the costs not as unit 
cost, but as actual costs (see Article 6.2.A -E). (One cost form per installation and access 
provider.)  
The use of unit costs for access activiti es is optional, i.e. each beneficiary/linked third party 
can decide independently whether to be reimbursed on the basis of unit costs or actual costs.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019 EJP Cofund MGA  
EJP Cofund > Chapter 3 > Article 6.2.F  736 If a beneficiary has initially opted for actual costs, it may only change its choice to unit costs 
throug h an amendment to the agreement (see Article 55) . 
1.3.3  The costs must fulfil the following eligibility  conditions : 
 fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the 
action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 
6.1(b) ) 
 be incurred for providing access to research infrastructure to other beneficiaries  
1.3.4  They must be calculated  as follows:  
amount per unit (see Annex 2 a GA)  x  number of units of access actually provided to other beneficiaries  
 
Example  for calculat ing unit cost s of access to research infrastructure:  
An access provider considers that the unit of access to the installation is calendar days. It provided 200 days of 
access in year N -1 and 150 days in year N -2. The total cost of providing this access, calculated on the basis of the 
categories of costs indicated above and the beneficiary’s usual cost -accounting practices, is EUR  50 000  000 for year 
N-1 and EUR  20 000  000 for year N -2. 
Unit cost  = EUR 35 000  000 (average annual tota l cost)  = EUR 200  000 per day  
  175 days (average annual total access)  
If the access provider makes the installation available for  the Fusion programme EJP Cofund action for 50 days in 
year N, the total to be declared under unit costs for research infrastructure for year N will be EUR 10   000  000.

 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11);  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks d escribed in Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission] [Agency]  and the other 
beneficiaries for implementing the action.

ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Deliverable:  Annual work plan  
What & When ? For EJP Cofund actions, the coordinator must submit to the Commission/Agency 
— for each twelve -month period of the EJP — an annual work plan.  
This plan contains a detailed description of the activities for that period, in line  with the 
objectives and description of work set out in Annex 1. Thus, while Annex 1 may include the 
targeted areas for research or other activities, it is the annual work plan that will define and 
specify the activities and the deliverables.  
Example:  
Annex 1 of a EJP contains a work package dedicated to a series of irradiation experiments in a large 
research facility. The annual work plan for the first reporting period provides a detailed description of 
the planned experiments on the related materials an d the expected milestones.  
As the programme develops, additional irradiation capacity becomes available in year 3. Alternatively, 
the validation of previous results requires further work or other materials become interesting. The 
consortium proposes an an nual work plan with additional experiments commencing in that reporting 
period.  ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES  
19.1  Obligation to submit deliverables  
The coordinator must submit:  
- 90 days before the end of each reporting period:  
(a) the ‘annual work plan  for the next year ’ (see Annex 7), for approval by the 
[Commission][Agency]  and 
(b) a summary progress report  on the activities carried out during the on -going reporting 
period  
This report must show how the activities proposed in the annual work plan for the next 
year ensure continuity with the work already carried out.  
If the [Commission][Agency] considers that the annual work plan for the next year does not comply 
with Annex 1, the coordinator must submit a revised version within 30 days from receiving formal 
notification.  
If the [Commission][Agency] considers that the revised annual work plan for the next year still 
does not comply with Annex 1, it may terminate the Agreement (see Article 50.3).  
- the other  ‘deliverables ’ identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing an d conditions set out 
in it.  
19.2  Consequences of non -compliance  
If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the [Commission][Agency]  may apply 
any of the measures described in Chapter 6.  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019 EJP Cofund MGA  
EJP Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 19  739 An EJP consortium therefore has a certain flexibility to develop activities and use the 
allocated budget (as long as the proposed activities remain in line with the EJP object ives 
and description of work (Annex 1) as initially evaluated)  
The annual work plan must be drawn up using the template in Annex 7.  
The periods of the annual work plans coincide with the reporting periods (see Article 20 ), but 
the work plans must be submitted  3 months (i.e. 90 days) in advance  to allow for review by 
the Commission /Agency  (— except for th e annual work plan for the first reporting period , 
which  must already be part of the  proposal ; see the proposal templates ). 
If the Commission/Agency considers that the proposed annual work plan does not comply with 
Annex 1, it will ask the coordinator to submit a revised a nnual work plan  (— within 30 days 
from receiving the request).  
How?  The annual work plan must be uploaded directly in  the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
 
2. Deliverable: Summary progress report  
What & When?  The annual work plan must be accompanied by a summary progress report.  
The summary progress report should focus on how the activities proposed in the annual work plan 
ensure continuity with the work already carried out.  
It should NOT contain an analysis of all activities carried out during the reporting period (since 
that is  the purpose of two other documents that must be submitted as part of the periodic reports, 
i.e. the explanation of the work carried out and the overview of the progress; see Article 20.3 ).

1. Reports  
Like the General MGA, the EJP Cofund MGA foresees periodic reports  for each reporting period 
(including the final one) , with both a technical and a financial part (see Article 2 0 H2020 General 
MGA). 
 
2. Reporting periods  
EJP Cofund actions are divided in 5 reporting periods  of 12 months  each.  
Each reporting period triggers a periodic report.  
 
3. Request for a second pre -financing payment — Statement on the use of the 
previous pre -financing payment  
The GA may provide for this option for large EJPs that need a second pre -financing payment (at 
the beginning of the second reporting period; see Article 21 ). 
Payment of further pre-financing payment s is not automatic. It must be requested via a statement 
on the use of the first pre -financing payment (see Annex 8 ). ARTICLE 20 — REPORTING — PAYMENT REQUESTS  
20.1 Obligation to submit reports  
The coordinator must submit to the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52)  the technical and financial 
reports se t out in this Article. These reports include the requests for payment and must be drawn up using 
the forms and templates provided in the electronic exchange system (see Article 52).  
20.2 Reporting periods  
The action is divided into the following ‘reporting  periods ’: 
- RP1: from month 1 to month 12  
- RP2: from month 13 to month 24  
- RP3: from month 25 to month 36  
- RP4: from month 37 to month 48  
- RP5: from month 49 to month 60  
20.2a  Request for a second pre -financing payment    
[OPTION 1 in case of two pre-financing payments:  The coordinator must submit — within 30 days 
following the end of the first reporting period — a request for a second pre -financing payment .  
The request must be included in a ‘statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment ’ (see 
Annex 8).]

 ARTICLE 21 — PAYMENTS AND PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
21.1 Payments  to be made   
The following payments will be made to the coordinator:  
- a [first]  pre-financing payment ; 
- [a second pre -financing payment , on the ba sis of the request for a second pre -financing payment 
(see Article 20);]  
- one or more interim payments , on the basis of the request(s) for interim payment (see Article 20), 
and 
- one payment of the balance , on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
20). 
21.2 Pre-financing payment  — Amount  — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
The aim of the pre -financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The [Commission][Agency]  will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
Article 58) or from 10 days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest —  
make a [first] pre-financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], 
except if Article 48 applies.   
From this amount, an amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 
[OPTION  1 in case of a single pre -financing payment: 5%][ OPTION 2 in c ase of two pre -financing 
payments:  2,5% ] of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Commission and 
transferred into the ‘ Guarantee Fund ’.  
[OPTION in case of a second pre -financing payment: The [Commission][Agency]  will — within 30 d ays 
from the request for a second pre -financing payment (see Article 20.2a) — make a second pre -financing 
payment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], except if Article 48 applies . 
From this amount, an amount of EUR [ insert amount  (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 2.5% of 
the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), will be retained by the [Commission][Agency]  and 
transferred into the Guarantee Fund.  
If the statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment s hows that less than 70  % of the previous 
payment has been used to cover the costs of the action, the amount of the new pre -financing to be paid will 
be reduced by the difference between the 70 % threshold and the amount used.  ] 
[OPTION if the JRC is a bene ficiary:  The parts of the pre -financing payments related to the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) ([ insert amounts  (insert amounts in words) ] are not paid to the coordinator, but 
kept by the [Commission][Agency]  for the JRC.] 
[…] 
21.5 Notification of amounts due   
When making payments, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify to the coordinator the amount 
due, specifying whether it concerns a [second pre -financing payment,] interim payment or the payment of 
the balance.  
For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.

EJP Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  742  
 
 
 
 
1. Payments  to be made   
Normally, EJP Cofund actions are divided in 5 reporting periods (see Article 20.2 ), with one pre -
financing payment and interim payments for each reporting period.  
Large EJPs may exceptionally benefit from a second pre -financing payment (at the beginning of 
the second reporting period).  
Example (two pre -financing payments):  
An EJP receives a grant with a maximum grant amount of EUR 30 million. A total pre -financing of EUR 8 
million is agreed but is split into two pre -financings of EUR 4 million each.  
First pre -financing = EUR 4 000 000 with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 2, 5% = EUR 
750 000  net payment of EUR 3 250 000  
Second pre -financing :  
1a: The coordinat or submits a statement showing that at least EUR 2 275 000 (70% of the EUR 3 250 
000) has been used to cover the costs of the action  the second pre -financing will be EUR 4 000 000 
with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 2, 5% = EUR 750  000 = n et payment of EUR 3 250 
000 
1b: The coordinator submits a statement showing that EUR 1 950 000 (60% of the initial pre -financing) 
has been used to cover the costs of the action  the second pre -financing will be EUR 4 000 000 – (EUR 
2 275 000 – EUR 1 950 0 00) = EUR 3 675 000 with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 
2,5% = EUR 750 000  net payment of EUR 2 925 000  
The second pre -financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requested by the coordinator 
via a ‘statement on the use of the first pr e-financing payment ’ (see Article 20 ). 
The balance is paid when the action ends.  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
Pre-financing payment  
How much? The pre -financing for EJP Cofund actions is normally 20% of the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1 ( — unless it is exceptionally fixed higher or lower,  to reflect the size 
and the needs of the EJP, the reimbursement rate in the work programme/call  and/or the 
availability of EU budget credits ) 
If the GA foresees a second pre -financing payment, the Guarantee Fund retention (of 5% of 
the maximum  grant  amount) will be split between the two pre -financing payments.  
 
  The second/third pre -financing payment will be reduced , if — according to the statement on use of the 
previous pre -financing instalment — the previous pre -financing was not fully  used : 
 if 70% or more of the first/second  pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing is 
paid in full  
 if less than 70% of the first/second pre -financing has been used: the second/third pre -financing will 
be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actual ly used and 70%.  
 
 
 
. 
 In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.

VIII. Framework Partnerships and Specific Agreements  
VIII.1 Background information and approach  
The H2020  FPA and H2020 SGA  are used for framework partnerships and specific grants (under 
such framework partnerships ) ONLY . 
‘Framework partnerships ’ are long-term co -operations  that:  
 pursue a mutual interest and common general objectives (that coincide with EU p olicy)  
– have an action plan with actions that were defined and agreed jointly on the basis of 
the common general objectives and  
– have an ongoing formal arrangement to implement (potential ) action s (i.e. the FPA and 
SGAs).  
Currently, framework partnerships ar e only open to actions under the General MGA (i.e. all 
kinds of research and innovation actions (RIA), innovation actions (IA) and coordination and 
support actions (CSA))  and for PCP/PPI actions . Framework partnerships are currently not 
(yet) open to ERANET, EJP, ERC, MSC A or SME Instrument specific actions.  
As from GA 4.0 FPA/SGAs are also possible for PCP/PPI actions. This does NOT apply to older 
grant agreements.  
 
 
 
The FPA and SGA generally follow the General MGA for content, but with a different numbering:

6 The action plan should include the common objectives of the parties and the types of activities cove red under this framework 
partnership, that contribute to the achievement of those objectives.  
 
 Same partners at FPA and SGA level  — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
However, partners /linked third parties  that do not want to actively participate in a specific action, may 
participate as partners not carrying out action tasks  and will not have to comply with most of the 
obligations under that SGA (see Preamble SGA ).

FPA 749 Applicants who accept the partnership by signing the F PA become partners to the Agreement and 
are bound by  its terms and conditions . 
Other entities involved in the partnership which do not sign the FPA (including entities linked to 
the partners) are considered as third parties involved in the partnership . 
They are not bound by the terms and conditions of the FPA and SGA; conversely, the 
Commission/Agency has no obligation towards  third parties.  
Only linked third parties are normally involved in the framework partnership itself. Other third 
parties are norma lly only inv olved in the specific actions ( third parties involved in the 
specific actions ).

AGREEMENTS  
2.1 Action plan  
The objectives and activities under the framework partnership  are set out in the ‘action plan ’ in Annex 1.  
2.2 Award of specific grants  for specific actions — Specific Agreements  
The [Commission][Agency]  may award ‘ specific grants ’ for actions to be implemented under the 
framework partnership (‘ specific actions ’).  
[OPTION 1 by default:  In order to obtain proposals for specific grants, the [Commission] [Agency] will 
consult the partners on the basis of [a call for proposals ][an invitation to submit a proposal ]7 [a call for 
proposals or an invitation to submit a proposal] that sets out the [selection and]8 award criteria it will 
apply. [This call will be [open to all the partners for which this type of activity is i ncluded in an FPA action 
plan ] [open to all applicants meeting the announced criteria].] The partners are not obliged to respond to 
such consultations and may choose not to submit any proposal. ]  
[OPTION 2 if foreseen in the work programme:  The partners must submit the proposals for specific 
grants  (consisting of [ insert documents to be submitted with proposal ]) [for [insert the name(s) of the 
activity ]] by [the date(s) specified in the action plan][ insert date ].] 
The [Commission][Agency]  will decide on the award of the specific grants following an evaluation of the 
proposal  [and a competitive review across partners of different framework partnerships].  
If the [Commission][Agency]   decides to award a specific grant, it will propose the par tners to conclude a 
‘Specific Agreement (SGA) ’ (see Annex 2).  
By entering into the Specific Agreement [OPTION if the JRC is a partner:  or the Administrative 
Arrangement] , the partners accept the specific grant and agree to implement the specific action un der their 
own responsibility and in accordance with the Framework Partnership Agreement and the Specific 
Agreement, with all the obligations and conditions they set out  
Specific Agreements must be concluded before the end of the framework partnership (see Article 3).  
After the end of the framework partnership or its termination, the Framework Partnership Agreement 
continues to apply to specific actions that are implemented under Specific Agreements  which have entered 
into force before end of the duration.  
 
7  The invitation to submit a proposal is an option reserved:  
- for monopoly situations or partners designated in the basic act;,   
- for cases where work is carried out in a network with pre -determined partners under the conditions laid down in the basic acts 
or 
- for actions with specific characteristics that require a particular type of body on account of its technical competence, its high 
degree of specialisation or its administrative power, on condition that the actions concerned do not fall within the s cope of a 
call for proposals.  
8  Use this option if you opt for an open call for proposals (‘a call for proposals open to all applicants meeting the announced  criteria’).  
 
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  FPA 
FPA > Chapter 2 > Article 2  752 1. Framework partnership — Action plan  
What?  Framework  partnerships are  long-term partnership s based on jointly agreed general 
object ives and a roadmap of actions ( action plan ). 
The action plan should normally include at least the following:  
 the objectives of the partnership  (as set out in the work programme/call)  
 the list of actions covered (including an indicative work plan)  
 an explanation of how the actions will contribute to the achievement of the objectives  
 the description of the partners  
 key performance indicators  
 information on the arrangements for intellectual property rights and open access (if 
relevant at FPA level)  
 information on ethics and gender issues (if relevant).  
The partnership is established in a FPA and implemented by SGAs for specific actions.   
For this p urpose, specific grants will be announced in work programme s/calls .  
The FPA does NOT  oblige the Commission/Agency to award specific grants.  
Specific grants can be awarded only in line with the action plan.  
The partners remain free  to participate also in other calls for proposals organised by the 
Commission/Agency, in order to receive grants outside the action plan.  
Framework partnerships can in principle be funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020.   
Currently, they are however only open to actions under the General MGA (i.e. all kinds of 
research and innovation actions (RIA), innovation actions (IA) and coordination and support 
actions (CSA)  (e.g. H2020 -FETFLAG -2014; H2020 -EINFRA -2014-2) and PCP - PPI actions ; 
Framework partnerships are currently NOT (yet) open to ERANET, EJP, ERC, MSC A or SME 
Instrument specific actions.  
 
2. Award of specific grants  
The specific grants are awarded to partners through one or more of the following procedures 
(depending on which options were inserted  in the FPA):  
– with competition  (calls for proposals) :  
– open to all partners for which this type of activity is included in the FPA action plan  
Such calls are restricted to the consortia that have signed a FPA and compete for the 
specific grant . 
Example:  The Commission signs different FPAs. In the call for proposals for specific grants, it 
establishes that participation is restricted to applicants who have already signed an FPA. Consortia 
A and B have signed FPAs with the Commission – FPA-1 in the case of Consortium A and FPA -2 in 
the case of Consortium B. Following submission of the proposal and a positive evaluation,  
Consortium B is awarded the grant and signs an SGA with the Commission in the framework of 
FPA-2. 
– open to all applicants meeting the criteria  

H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  FPA 
FPA > Chapter 2 > Article 2  753 Such calls are open  to any legal entity that satisfies the criteria set out in the call for 
proposals.  
 without competition :  
 invitations to submit a proposal  
Such invitations can only be issued in one of the following cases:  
 in monopoly situations or where partners are desig nated in the basic act  
– if work is carried out in a network with pre -determined partners under 
conditions laid down in the basic acts  
– for actions with specific characteristics that require a particular type of body on 
account of its technical competence, h igh degree of specialisation or 
administrative capacity, and do not fall within the scope of a call for proposals  
 submission of a proposal  by a certain date  
This option can be included in the FPA only if it is provided for in the work 
programme /call.  
The date must be set out in the action plan or in Article 2 FPA .

ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE FRAMEWORK 
PARTERNSHIP  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Framework  partnership  starting date  
The starting date of the framework partnership is fixed by the Commission/Agency in the FPA . 
It is usually the first day of the month following the date on which the FPA enters into force. The 
FPA enters into force when the last party signs it (see Article 64 FPA) . 
Example:  The FPA is signed by the coordinator on 30 December 2014 and by the Commission on 5 January 
2015. The starting date of the partnership is 1 February 2015.  
 
2. Framework partnership  duration  
The framework partnership  duration  may not exceed four years, except in duly justified 
exceptional cases (e.g. to align it with the duration of the Horizon 2020 Programme ). 
The FPA duration can  NOT be extended (i.e. it is not possible to request an amendment extending 
the duration) . The duration of an FPA only determines the moment up to which SGAs can be 
signed . The SGAs can still be implemented after the end of the framework partnership . 
All SGAs must be signed before the end of the FPA.  
 
 ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP  
The Framework Partnership Agreement  is concluded for a period of [ insert number ] of months ([ …]years)9 
as of its entry into force (see Article 64). This period cannot be extended.  
 
9 Not more than four years, except in duly justified exceptional cases (for instance, to align it with the duration of the framework 
programme) (Article 178 Rules of Application Regulation No  1268/2012 ). 
 
 Certain provisions of the FPA will continue to apply for the on -going SGAs even if the FPA has ended.

PARTNERSHIP  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Consortium agreement  
As a general rule,  the partners must conclude a FPA consortium agreement to  ensure a smooth 
and successful implementation of the framework p artnership and the specific actions  (like for GAs; 
see Article  41.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
 
 
  If necessary, the consortium may decide to have — in addition to the FPA consortium agreement — 
specific consortium agreements for each SGA . In this case, the consortium will need to ensure a 
mechanism to settle possible conflicts between the different consortium agreements.  
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — RIGHT S AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP  
4.1 Obligation to properly implement the framework partnership  
The partners must respect the objectives of the framework partnership and implement it as described in 
Annex 1  and endeavour to achieve those objectives also in the specific actions .  
The partners must maintain relations of mutual co -operation and regular and transparent exchanges of 
information with the [Commission][Agency]  on: 
- the implementation and follow -up of  the action plan and the specific grants and  
- other matters of common interest related to the Framework Partnership Agreement.  
The partners must implement the framework partnership in compliance with Articles 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 
52 — mutatis mutandis . 
4.2 Consortium agreement  
[OPTION 1 to be used, unless the work programme specifies that there is no need for a consortium 
agreement : The partners must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co -ordination to 
ensure that the framework partnership and the specific actions are implemented properly. These internal 
arrangements must be set out in a written ‘ consortium agreement ’ between the partners, which may cover:  
- internal organisation of the consortium;  
- management of access to the elec tronic exchange system;  
- distribution of EU funding;  
- additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (including whether 
access rights remain or not, if a partner is in breach of its obligations) (see Subsection 3 of Chapter 
3); 
- settlement of internal disputes;  
- liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the partners.  
The consortium agreement must not contain any provision contrary to the Framework Partnership 
Agreement and the Specific Agreements. ]

ARTICLE 5 — SUSPENSION OF FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP IMPLEMENTATION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Suspension of framework partnership implementation  
The rules on suspension of framework partnershi p implementation are similar to GA suspension 
(see Article 4 9 H2020 General MGA ).  
 
 
Amendments (to resume the action) after a  suspension can  NOT have the effect of extending the 
FPA duration set out in  Article 3  FPA. ). The duration of an FPA only determines the moment up to 
which SGAs can be signed  An SGA can be implemented after the end of the framework 
partnership.  ARTICLE 5  — SUSPENSION OF FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP IMPLEMENTATION  
The parties may suspend  the implementation of the framework partnership  on the grounds and 
according to the procedure — mutatis mutandis  — set out in Article 55.  
If the framework partnership implementation is suspended, all specific actions are also suspended (see 
Article 55) — from the date of suspension of the framework partnership.  
 
  FPA suspension  automatically supends all on-going specific actions .

1. FPA t ermination  
The FPA can be terminated at any time and on any grounds, without the need for a contradictory 
procedure between the parties.  
 
 
 
 
2. Beneficiary  termination  
The parties may terminate the participation of a partner in the framework partnership on similar 
grounds (and according to similar procedures ) as their termination in actions (see Article 50 
H2020 General MGA ). 
 
 
  FPA termination has NO effect on ongoing SGAs  (— unless they are also terminated; see Article 56 FPA 
and Article 20 SGA ). Certain provisions of the FPA will continue to apply for the on -going SGAs even if the 
FPA is terminated.  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 6 — TERMINATION OF THE FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OR OF 
THE PARTICIPATION OF ONE OR MORE PARTNERS  
6.1 Termination of the Agreement   
The parties may terminate the Framework Partnership Agreement at any time.  
The party terminating the Framework Partnership Agreement must formally notify termination to the other 
party, stating the date the termination will take effect.  This date must be after the notification.  
Termination of the Framework Partnership Agreement does not release the parties from their obligations 
under Specific Agreements  which have entered into force before the date on which the termination takes 
effect , unless they have b een terminated.  
Neither party may claim damages due to termination by the other party.  
6.2 Termination of the participation of one or more partners   
The parties may terminate participation of one or more partners in the framework partnership on the ground s 
and according to the procedures — mutatis mutandis  — set out in Article 56.2.1, 56.3.1 and 56.3.2.  
The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 61) to adapt Annex 1 and, if necessary, 
the addition of one or more new partners (see Article 62).   
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission] [Agency], the Framework Partne rship 
Agreement may be terminated (see above).  
Termination of participation in the framework partnership does not release the partner concerned from its 
obligations under Specific Agreements.  It cannot however participate in specific actions awarded after the 
date on which the termination takes effect .

FPA > Chapter 2 > Article 6  758  
 
 Different  partners at FPA and SGA level  (exceptional)  — Beneficiary t ermination may lead to a 
different consortium composition at FPA and SGA level — unless participation is ended on both levels (and 
for ALL SGAs).  
This is one of the very few cases of a different consortium composition. Normally, consortium 
composition is the same, but p artners /linked third parties can participate as partners not carrying out 
action tasks for certain specific actions.  
 Example:  A partner wants to terminate participation in the framework partnership because it no longer has 
interest in future SGAs (while it wants to finish the ongoing ones it has committed to).

ARTICLE 9 — ESTIMATED BU DGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Budget categories  
The budget categories  of the SGA will depend on the type of SGA used.  
Example:  For RIA, IA and CSA specific actions , the SGA will use the budget categories  of the General MGA:  
 direct personnel costs  
 direct costs of subcontracting  
 direct costs of providing financial support to third parties (if option applies)  
 other direct costs  
 indirect costs  
 specific cost categories (if option applies) (see Article 4 H2020 General MGA ).  
 
 
 ARTICLE 9 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
9.1 Estimated budget  
The estimated budget for the specific actions is set out in Annex 2 to the Specific Agreements.  
It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by partner [and linked third 
party]  and budget category  (Articles 4, 5 , 6 SGA [and Article 19 FPA]  It also shows, if applicable, the 
estimated costs of the partners  not receivin g EU funding, if applicable (see Article 7 SGA) and of the

10.1  Maximum grant amount  
The maximum grant amount for the specific grants is set out in the Specific Agreements (see Article 4 
SGA) .  
10.2  Form of grant , reimbursement rates  and form(s) of costs  
The form of the grant, reimbursement rate(s), estimated eligible costs and the form(s) of costs of the specific 
grants are set out in the Specific Agreements (see Article 4 SGA).  
10.3  Final grant amount  — Calculation  
The final grant amount of a specific grant depe nds on the actual extent to which the specific action  is 
implemented in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Framework Partnership Agreement and the 
Specific Agreement concerned .  
This amount  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
Article 17 SGA)  — in the following steps:  
Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs  
Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount  
Step 3 – Reduction due to the no -profit rule  
Step 4 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of obligations  
10.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate(s) (see Article 4 SGA) are applied to the eligible costs (actual costs,  unit costs, flat -
rate costs and lump sum costs; see Article 5 SGA) declared by the partners [and the linked third parties]  
(see Article 16 SGA) and approved by the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 17 SGA).  
10.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amoun t 
If the amount  obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount (see Article 4 SGA), it 
will be limited to the latter.  
10.3.3 Step 3 — Reduction due to the no -profit rule  
The specific grant must not produce a profit.  
‘Profit’ means the surplus of the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 plus the specific action’s total 
receipts, over the specific action’s total eligible costs.  
The ‘specific action’s total eligible costs’ are the consolidated total eligible costs approved by  the 
[Commission][Agency] . 
The ‘specific action’s total receipts’ are the consolidated total receipts generated during its duration (see 
Article 3 SGA).

 The following are considered receipts : 
(a) income generated by the specific action; if the income is generated from selling  equipment or other 
assets purchased under the Specific Agreement, the receipt is up to the amount declared as eligible 
under the Specific Agreement;  
(b) financial contributions g iven by third parties to the partner [or to a linked third party ]  specifically 
to be used for the specific action, and  
(c) in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge specifically to be used for the specific 
action, if they have been declar ed as eligible costs . 
The following are however not considered receipts:  
(a) income generated by exploiting the specific action’s results (see Article 34);  
(b) financial contributions by third parties, if they may be used to cover costs other than the eligible 
costs (see Article 5 SGA);  
(c) financial contributions by third parties with no obligation to repay any amount unused at the end of 
the period set out in Article 3 of the Specific Agreement).  
If there is a profit, it will be deducted from the amount obtained f ollowing Steps 1 and 2.  
10.3.4 Step 4 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the specific grant is reduced (see Article 49) , the [Commission][Agency]  will  calculate the reduced grant 
amount  by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations in accordance with Article 49.2) from the maximum grant 
amount ( see Article 4 SGA).  
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
- the amount obtained following Steps 1 to 3 or  
- the reduced grant amount following Step 4.  
10.4  Revised final grant amount  — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balan ce (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 28) — the [Commission][Agency]  rejects costs (see Article 48) or reduces the specific grant (see 
Article 49), it will calculate the ‘revised final grant amount’  for the partner concerned by the findings .  
This amount  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  on the basis of the findings, as follows:  
- in case of rejection of costs : by applying the reimbursement rate to the revised eligible costs 
approved by the [Commission][Agency]  for the partner concerned ; 
- in case of reduction of the specific grant : by calculating  the concerned partner’s share in the grant 
amount reduced in proportion to to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or  breach of 
obligations (see Article 49.2).   
In case of rejection of costs and reduction  of the specific grant : the revised final grant amount for the 
partner concerned will be the lower of the two amounts above.

The specific eligibility conditions , applicable per budget category , are set out in Article 5 SGA. 
The SGA will use the budget categories  that belong to the type of specific action, with the same 
types of costs , eligibility c onditions and calculation rules . 
Example:  For RIA, IA or CSA specific actions , the budget categories, types of costs, eligibility conditions and

11.2  Ineligible costs  
The conditions under which costs are considered ineligible under the specific grants are set out in the 
Specific Agreements (see Article 5 SGA) .   
11.3 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 48).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Section 5 .

The rules on third party involvement will depend on the type of SGA used.  
Example:  For RIA, IA and CSA specific actions , the SGA will use the rules on third party involvement of the 
General MGA  (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA ). 
Linked third parties  must already be identified in the FPA (see Article 19 FPA) . Their specific 
activities must then be set out in the specific actions.  
Example s: 
1. Third parties making resources available against payment or free of charge (see Articles 9 and 10 FPA ) must 
be identified in Annex I of the SGA.   
2. Linked third parties carrying out specific action task must be identified in the FPA and also in Annex I of the

 Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to fully participate in the framework 
partnership and specific action s, like the partner they are linked to .   
Linked third parties can NOT however do more than their partners: If a  linked third part y wants to 
participate in a specific action, its partner must also be active in that action (i.e. NOT be partner not 
carrying out action tasks). If the  partner does not want to, the linked third party  could itself become a 
partner of the FPA and SGA  (— after the consortium composition is changed) .

1. Accession to the FPA and SGA s 
While the coordinator signs the FPA, the other partners must accede to the FPA by means of the 
Accession Forms.  
In doing so, they mandate the coordinator : 
 to submit and sign in their name and on their behalf any amendments  to the 
framework  
 to sign in their name and on their behalf any SGA that may be awarded.  
  The SGAs are signed ONLY by the coordinator. The other partners do NOT need to sign accession forms 
for the SGAs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 62 — ACCESSION TO THE FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT AND THE 
SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS  
62.1 Accession  of the partners mentioned in the preamble  
The other partners must accede to the Framework Partnership Agreement by signing the Accession Form 
(see Annex 3) in the electronic exchange system ( see Article 58) — within 30 days after its entry into force 
(see Article 64). [OPTION  if Article 19 applies and joint and several liability has been requested: and for 
partners for which the [Commission][Agency] has requested joint and several liability of  a linked third 
party, by also submitting — at accession to the Framework Partnership Agreement — a declaration on joint 
and several liability  (see Annex 3a) signed by the third party. ] 
All partners having acceded to the Framework Partnership Agreement mus t be part of the Specific 
Agreements. The partners will accede to the Specific Agreements by signature of the coordinator (see 
mandate in Annex 3).  
They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreements with effect from the date of their entry 
into force (see Article 64 and Article 21 SGA).  
If a partner does not accede to the Framework Partnership Agreement within the above deadline, the 
coordinator must — within 30 days — request an amendment to make any changes necessary to ensure 
proper imple mentation of the action plan. This does not affect the [Commission’s] [Agency’s] right to 
terminate the agreements (see Articles 6 and 56).

1. Addition of a new partner  
New partners can be added at any moment of the framework partnership.  
 
 
 
Before any SGA has been concluded, only the FPA must be amended.  
Once an SGA has already been concluded, both the FPA and the SGA must be amended.  
The coordina tor must first submit a request for  the FPA  amendment  (which will automatically 
include the change in the consortium composition for the SGAs  — the new beneficiary is added 
(automatically) as ‘inactive ’ to all signed SGA s under  that FPA).  
The coordinator must then request for  each SGA a separate amendment  to activate the new 
beneficiary  (e.g. to change Annex 1 , Annex 2 ). 
The conditions for accepting new partners are the same as under the General MGA (see Article 
56.2 H2020 General MGA ). 
 62.2 Addition of new partners  
In justified cases, the partners may request the addition of a new partner.  
For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment of the Framework Partnership and 
the Specific Agreements in accordance with  Article 61. It must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) 
signed by the new partner in the electronic exchange system (see Article 58).  
New partners must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreements with effect from the date of their 
accessio n specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3).  
 Same partners at FPA and SGA level  — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
The new partner must therefore be  added at both levels.

1. Dispute settlement  
The rules on dispute settlement are similar to those of the General MGA  (see Article 57 .2 H2020 
General MGA ).  
However  for FPAs , the Commission/Agency will determine already at FPA -level which partners 
must participate  as ‘beneficiaries not receiving EU funding’ — because of a general issue with the 
jurisdiction clause (i.e. Belgian courts). Those beneficiaries can NEVER receive EU funding.  
All other partners’ status will be determined at SGA-level. Thus,  partners from eligible countries  
(EU Member State, H2020 associated country or third country listed  in General Annex A to the 
Main Work Programme ) may participate as  normal partners or as ‘partners not receiving EU 
funding’. Partners from non -eligible countries may participate as ‘partners not receiving EU 
funding’ or — exceptionally — be granted funding.   
 ARTICLE 63 — APPLICABLE LAW AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES  
63.2 Dispute settlement  
If a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or validity of the Framework Partnership Agreement 
or a Specific Agreement cannot be settled amicably, the General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice 
of the European Union — has sole jurisdic tion. Such actions must be brought under Article 272 of the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).  
[additional OPTION for non -EU partners (except partners established in an associated country with an 
association agreement to Horizon 2020 that stipulat es sole jurisdiction of the European Court of 
Justice) : As an exception, if such a dispute is between the [Commission] [Agency]  and [ insert non -EU 
partner(s) name(s )], the competent Belgian courts have sole jurisdiction .] 
[additional OPTION  for international organisations and for partners not eligible for EU funding which 
according to their national law cannot be subject to the jurisdiction of the Belgian courts:  As an 
exception, for the following partners:  
- [insert name of international organisation  or partner not eligible for EU funding ]  
- [insert name of international organisation  or partner not eligible for EU funding ] 
[same for other partners that are international organisations  or partner not eligible for EU funding ] 
 such disputes mu st — if they cannot be settled amicably — be referred to arbitration. Each party must 
formally notify to the other party its intention of resorting to arbitration and the identity of the arbitrator.   
The Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional Rules for Ar bitration Involving International Organisations 
and States in force at the date of entry into force of the Framework Partnership Agreement will apply. The 
appointing authority will be the Secretary -General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration following a 
written request submitted by either party. The arbitration proceedings must take place in Brussels and the 
language used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. The arbitral award will be binding on all parties 
and will not be subject to appeal.]  
If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU 
(see Articles 50, 51 and 52), the partners must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the 
Court of Justice of the European Union — under Article 263 TFEU. Actions against enforceable decisions 
must always be brought against the Commission (not against the Agency — even in Agency specific 
grants).

1. Participants: Partners — Partners not carrying out action tasks under th e SGA  
— Linked third parties  
The partners of a SGA are generally the same as the partners of the FPA  (see Article 62.1 
FPA). 
 
 
 
However, not all partners of a framework partnership must actively participate in all specific 
actions.  
Partners (and linked third parties) who do NOT actively partic ipate in a specific action are 
partners not carrying out action tasks  under that Specific Agreement (and must be 
identified as such in the preamble to the SGA).   
 
 
 
 
 By entering into the Specific Agreement [OPTION if the JRC is a partner:  or the Αdministrative 
Αrrangement] , the partners accept the grant and agree to implement the specific action, under their own 
responsibility and in accordance with the Framework Partnership Agreement and this Specific Agreement, 
with all the obligations and conditions they set out.  
The Sp ecific Agreement is composed of:  
Terms and Conditions  
Annex 1       Description of the action  
Annex 2     Estimated budget for the action  
Annex 2a  Additional information on the estimated budget  
Annex 3  Model for the financial statements

accordance with document 60008 of 22.02.2001 ‘ Mise en place de la Charte des ordonnateurs ’. 
 
 Same partners at FPA and SGA level  — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
An entity that is not partner/linked third party  in the FPA cannot become party in the SGA. Conversely, all 
partners/linked t hird parties  to the FPA become parties to the SGA.  
 
 Partners not carrying out action tasks  — They formally participate in the action as partners, 
but NOT with any action tasks or EU funding. In practice, most of the obligations therefore do not 
apply to them for that specific action.  
Linked third parties — If a partner participates  as not carrying out action tasks, its linked third 
parties  get the same status. They can NOT actively pa rticipate in the specific action ( — unless they 
themselves become partners of the FPA and SGA).  
H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  SGA 
 
SGA 770 These partners are formally  part of the consortium for the SGA (and are parties to this 
SGA, meaning that the coordinator signs also in their name).   
They will be identified in Annex 1  as 'partners not carrying action tasks'  (as they do not 
carry out any action tasks). Moreover, they will also be mentioned in Annex 2 with  zero 
costs. 
Formally, the rights and o bligations under the FPA and SGA fully apply to the m. In practice 
however, many  of them (e.g. implementation, deliverables, technical and financial 
reporting, keeping of supporting documents, financial or technical audits or reviews, IPR 
results, access to  background and results of others, etc.) are NOT  applicable because these 
partners do not carry out action tasks  and do not receive any EU funding . Other obligations 
remain relevant (e.g. checks, information obligations, confidentiality) . 
SGAs are signed  by the coordinator on behalf of the other partners  (see Article 62.1 FPA ). 
The documents must be signed directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal . 
The other partners do NOT need to sign A ccession Forms.  
Other entities involved in a specific action which do not sign the SGA (including linked third 
parties ) are considered as third parties involved in the specific action .

ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Action starting date  
For MSCA -IF, the rules on the action starting date are in principle the same as in the General MGA 
(see Article 3 H2020 General MGA ).Normally, the SGA starting date should also be after the entry 
into force  of the FPA (because one presumes the other). However, in justified cases, it is possible 
to exceptionally fix an SGA starting date before the entry into force of the FPA (i.e. retroactive).  
If the consortium requests a starting date before the entry into force of the FPA, it assumes the 
risks implied by starting the action before the FPA and SGA are signed (in particular not being 
reimbursed for the costs incurred , e.g. if the proposal is not successful or that the FPA/SGA are 
not signed ).

The duration of the specific action will be [insert number ] months as of [OPTION 1 by default: the first day 
of the month following the date the Specific Agreement enters into force (see Article 21)] [OPTION 2 if 
needed for the action: insert date]  (‘starting date of the action’).  
 
 
 
 The SGA action starting date can in any case NEVER  be before the submission  of the SGA proposal.

For SGAs, the minimum number of partners will be explicitly indicated in the call for proposals 
(or — if there is no call for proposals  — in the work programme  and the invitation to submit a 
proposal ). The minimum numbers of partners refers to the partners  implementing the specific 
action.  
 
 
 
 Same partners at FPA and SGA level  — If a specific action requires more partners than are currently 
in the framework partnership, the FPA first needs to be enlarged .

The co ordinator must distribute the payments between the partners without unjustified delay.  
Pre-financing may however be distributed only:  
a) if the minimum number of partners  set out in the call for proposals has acceded to the 
Framework and Specific Agreement (see Article 62  FPA)  and 
b) to partners that have entered  into the  Specific Agreement (see Article 62  FPA).

IX. Lump Sum MGA s 
IX.1 Background information and approach  
The General Lump Sum Model Grant Agreement  (H2020 General Lump Sum MGA) is used mainly 
for coordin ation and support actions (CSA ) and , exceptionally , for resear ch and innovation actions 
(RIA) and innovation actions (IA) — if the work programme/call provides for a lump sum grant . 
Example:  H2020 -INNOSUP -2014-5  
The Lump Sum Pilot Model Grant Agreement ( H2020 Lump Sum Pilot MGA ) is used in a limited 
number of cases provided for in the work programme/call.  
Example:  Specific  call within the Nanotechnologies, Advance Materials, Biotechnology and Advance 
Manufacturing and Processing  topic DT-NMBP -20-2018

Lump sum  774  
The main difference between the General Lump Sum MGA and the Lump Sum Pilot MGA lies in the 
grant implementation mechanisms: the General Lump Sum MGA works with eligible costs and pre -
financing payments (instead of interim payments); the Lump Sum Pilot MGA works with lump sum 
shares per work package and beneficiary (instead of  eligible costs) and interim payments based on 
accomplished work packages.  
The annotations will concentrate on differences in substance and interpretation that require 
explanation.  
Parts that do not appl y (Articles 6, 10, 11, 12, 42  Lump Sum Pilot MGA)  or differ only in 
presentation (e.g. Articles 4.2, 9, 11, 12, 16, 20.5, 21.3, 25.5 General Lump Sum MGA, Article 
43.3 Lump Sum Pilot MGA, Annexes ) will not be shown.  
For the  Lump Sum Pilot MGA, the  Articles where the only difference is the removal of 
references to eligibility of costs (e.g. Article 14, 14a, 17.1, 22.5, 41.2 – removal of CFS —) or 
rejection of costs (e.g. Articles 14.2, 15.3, 16.3, 18.2, 22.6) will not be shown.  
The annotations are bas ed on the multi -beneficiary version, since it is the most common for lump 
sum actions. Where there are significant differences (i.e. Articles 21, 41, 44, 49 and 50), the 
mono -beneficiary version of the Article is shown.   Article 20 (specific reporting provisions)  
 Article 21 (specific payment provisions)

1. Budget category  
The General Lump Sum MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA.  
Since these grants consist in a single lump sum, there is only one budget category.  
Budget category of the General Lump Sum MGA: 
 costs (direct and indirect costs)  
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated budget  
The ‘ estimated budget ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the budget category, the estimated eligible costs and the form of cost s (see Articles 5 and 6).  
4.2 Budget transfers  
Not applicable  
  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article

1. Maximum grant amount — Reimbursement rate — Cost forms  
How much & which form? The General Lump Sum MGA does not use the cost forms  of the 
General MGA, but is a lump sum  grant .  
The use of the lump sum  will be  set out in  the work prog ramme /call.  
The lump sum will be set to give a round amount when the EU reimbursement rate is applied 
(— important if the reimbursement rate is not 100%). It is one amount (for the entire 
consortium).  
The eligibility conditions are set out in Article 6 . If the action is correctly implemented, the 
beneficiaries are entitled to receive th is fixed amount of EU funding (lump sum ). ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT, FORM OF GRANT, REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND 
FORMS OF COSTS  
5.1 Maximum grant amount  
The ‘ maximum grant amount ’ is EUR  [insert amount (insert amount in words) ].  
5.2 Form of grant, reimbursement rate  and form of costs  
The grant reimburses [OPTION 1 for research and innovation actions (RIA) and coordination and 
support actions (CSA):  100 %  of the action’s eligible costs]  [OPTION 2 for innovation actions (IA): 70%  
of the action’s eligible costs]8[OPTION 3 for exceptional cases if foreseen in the work programme:  
[…%] of the action’s eligible costs] (see Article 6) (‘ reimbursement of eligible costs grant ’) (see Annex 
2). 
The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount  (insert amount in words) ]. 
Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared as the lump sum set out in Annex 2  (i.e. under the form of 
‘lump sum costs ’). 
 
8 For the definition, see Article 2.1 (6) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 
2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in 'Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and 
Innovati on (2014 – 2020)' (' Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013 ') (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013 p. 81): ' innovation action ' 
means an action primarily consisti ng of activities directly aiming at producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or 
improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, la rge-scale 
product validation an d market replication.  
 
 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs that are incurred for the action . NO 
other  costs will be reimbursed.

1. Final grant amount  
For General Lump Sum grants , the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in 
principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared is pre -filled by the system), 
there is NO  need to calculate the : 
 limit to the maximum grant amount or  
 reduction due to the  no-profit rule.  5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
 
The ‘final grant amount ’ depends on the proper implementation of  the action  in accordance with the 
Agreement’s terms and conditions .  
This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
Article 21)  — in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1  Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (lump sum costs; see Article 6) 
declared by the consortium and approved by the [Commission][ Agency] (see Article 21).  
5.3.2 Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of 
obligations — Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the reduced maximum 
grant amount by deducting the amount of the reduction (calcul ated in proportion to the seriousness of the 
errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum 
grant amount set out in Article 5.1.  
In this case, the final grant amount will be the lower of the foll owing two:  
- the amount obtained in Step 1 or  
 
- the amount obtained in Step 2.

1. Revised final grant amount  
For General Lump Sum grants , the rules on the calculation of the revised final grant amount are in 
principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, for General  Lump Sum grants, improper implementation of the action leads to 
ineligibility  of the costs (NOT to the reduction  of the grant). Therefore, t he grant  reduction 
mentioned in this provision does not relate to improper implementation of the action  (but only to 
other  breaches  and substantial errors, irregularities and fraud ; see Article 43 ).  
 5.4  Revised final grant amount — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 22) — the [Commission][ Agency]  rejects  costs (see Article 42) or reduces the grant (see Article 43), 
it will calculate the ‘ revised final grant amount ’.  
This amount  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  on the basis of the findings , as follows:  
- in case of rejection of costs : by applying the reimbursement rate to the revised eligible costs 
approved by the [Commission][Agency] ; 
 
- in case of reduction of the grant : in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
fraud or breach of obligations (see Article 43.2) .  
 
In case of rejection of costs and reduction  of the grant , the revised final grant amount will be the lower of 
the two amounts above.

ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
 
 
1. Eligible costs  
The General Lump Sum MGA has its own budget category , with its own types of costs , 
eligibility c onditions and calculation rules . 
 
2. Costs for the action  (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility c onditions — 
Calculation  
2.1 What?  The budget category  A ‘costs’ covers  the (direct and indirect ) costs for  the action.  
 
 
 
2.2 These costs must be declared as  the amount  set out in  the work programme/call . 
In practice , the declaration of costs for General Lump Sum grants is completely automatized . The 
coordinator  only need s to sign and submit the financial statement (pre -filled b y the IT system).  
2.3 They must fulfil the following eligibility conditions : 
 the action tasks must have been carried out as described in Annex 1.  ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS  
6.1 Eligible costs  
Costs for the budget category:  
A. Costs for the  action (direct and indirect costs)   
are eligible (‘eligible costs’), if they correspond to the lump sum set out in Annex 2 and if the 
corresponding tasks or parts of the action have been properly implemented in accordance with Annex 1.  
6.2 Ineligible cost s 
‘Ineligible costs ’ are:  
(a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (see Article 6.1) and  
 
(b) costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awa rded by bodies other than the 
[Commission][ Agency]   for the purpose of implementing the EU and Euratom budget.  
 
[(c) OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme: [insert name of 
excluded cost category ]].  
6.3 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs  
 
Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL  (direct and indirect) costs  that are incurred for the action . NO 
other  costs will be reimbursed.

By signing the financial statement (for multi -beneficiary actions: one common financial statement 
for the consortium; see Article 20 ), the beneficiaries automatically declare the amount set out in  
the work programme/call as the total eligible costs of the action (the amount is fixed and pre-filled 
by the IT system).

ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Consequences of improper implementation  
For General  Lump Sum grant s, ‘improper implementation of the action not in accordance with 
Annex 1’ does NOT lead to a reduction  of the grant, but to the ineligibility  of the costs ( see Article 
6.1). 
 
 
 
By contrast, in case of other serious breaches  the grant may be reduced  (see Article 43).  
 If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, costs will be rejected  proportionally to the 
tasks or parts of the action not implemented (see Article 42 ).  
 
 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  
7.1 General obligation to properly implement the action  
 
The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions 
of the Agreement and all legal obligations under applicable EU, internat ional and national law.  
7.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
 
If a beneficiary does not properly implement the action (or part of it),  the corresponding costs will be 
ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
If a beneficiary breach es any other obligation, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) .  
This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 .

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION  — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
parties involved in the action  
The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable  to the General 
Lump Sum MGA . 
The special rules from the General MGA on third party involvement are limited in General L ump 
Sum actions to purchases ( Article 10 ), subcontracting ( Article 13 ), linked third parties  (Article 14 ) 
and intern ational partners ( Article 14a ).  
By contrast, there are NO special rules for  in-kind contributions (Articles 11  and 12). Beneficiaries 
may use any in -kind contributions from third parties if they are needed to carry out the work of 
the action.   
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);   
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13);  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
- call upon inte rnational partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a).  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission][Agency]   for 
implementing the action.  
 
  For all types of third party involvement (purchases, subcontracts , linked third parties , in-kind 
contributions) , the costs  are ALL covered  by the lump sum.  NO other  costs will be reimbursed.

1. Purchase of goods, works or services  
The rules on contracts for the purchase of goods, works or services for General Lump Sum actions 
are almost identical to the General MGA (see Article 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The obligations in Article 10.1.1 are  however  NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility 
conditions, but ‘other obligations ’. In case of breach, t he Commission/Agency may therefore 
reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).  
 ARTICLE 10 — PURCHASE OF GOODS, WORKS OR SERVICES  
10.1 Rules for purchasing goods, works or services  
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may purchase goods, works or services.  
The beneficiaries must make such purchases ensuring the be st value for money or, if appropriate, the 
lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also 
towards their contractors.  
Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/18/EC9 (or 
2014/24/EU)10 or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC11 (or 2014/25/EU)12 
must comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.  
10.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this A rticle, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Subcontracting  
The rules on subcontracting for  General  Lump Sum actions  are similar to the General MGA (see 
Articles 8  and 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The General  Lump Sum MGA has however the following  specificities : 
The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT have to be included in Annex 1 or shown in the table 
of estimated costs of Annex 2 (since they are covered by the lump sum).  
The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
‘other obligations ’. In case of breach, t he Commission/Agency may therefore reduce the grant in 
proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).  
 ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 Rules for subcontracting action tasks  
 
If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may award subcontracts covering the 
implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1.  
Subcontracting may cover only a limited part  of the action.  
The beneficiaries must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action tasks  involving classified information may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Article 37). ] 
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also 
towards their subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
subcontractors.  
Beneficiaries th at are ‘contracting authorities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/18/EC (or 
2014/24/EU)  or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU) must 
comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.  
13.2 Conse quences of non -compliance  
 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

ARTICL E 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For General  Lump Sum actions , beneficiaries do not need to keep full records on their actual 
costs; they only need to keep the evidence (documentation, records) that the actions tasks (as 
described in Annex 1)  were properly carried out.  
The records and supporting documentation must:  
 refer to the technical implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in 
the respective field (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA ) and ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
 
The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default: five][ OPTION 2 for low value grants18: 
three] years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate records and other supporting documentation 
to prove the proper implementation of the action and the costs they declare as eligible . 
They must make them available upon req uest (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
investigations (see Article 22).  
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of fi ndings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they ar e authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission][Agency]  may accept non -
original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance.  
18.1.1 Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation  
The beneficiaries must keep records and other supporting documentation on scientific and technical 
implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field.  
18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support th e costs declared  
The beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation and other supporting documentation to 
prove that the corresponding tasks or part of the action as described in Annex 1 were  implemented properly . 
The beneficiaries do not need to identify the actual eligible costs covered or provide supporting 
documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount declared as a lump sum.  
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
 
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be

1. Reports  
What & When?  For General  Lump Sum actions , the coordinator must submit a periodic report  
after the end of each reporting period (including the final one).  
Before the end of the action, these are only technical report s, with information on the technical 
implementation.  
List of documents for the technical  reports:  
 explanation of the work carried out  
 overview of the progress  
 summary for publication  
 questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested)  
 statement on the use of the previous pre -financing instalment  
NO financial report ing is needed during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final 
report). The coordinator only  has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre -
financing instalment (which includes the request for further pre -financing payments; see Article 
7). 
How? Each periodic report must be prepared  by the coordinator  and the  other  beneficiaries  
together , directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal ). 
 
2. Reporting periods  
General  Lump Sum actions are nor mally  divided into several reporting periods and  each reporting 
period triggers a further pre -financing .  
Each reporting period triggers a periodic report.  
 
3. Final f inancial report : Financial statement  
The financial statement (one common financial statem ent for the consortium) is automatically pre -
filled by the system (with the amount set out in the work programme/call as final grant amount; 
see Article 5 ). 
 
 
 20.8 Consequences of non -compliance  
If the reports submitted do not comply with this Article, the [Commission][Agency] may suspend the 
payment deadline (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
If the coordinator breaches its obligation to submit the report s and if it fails to comply with this obligation 
within 30 days following a written reminder, the [Commission][Agency]  may terminate the Agreement (see 
Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
The [Commission][Agency] will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
Article 58) or from 10 days before the starting date of the action (see Article  3), whichever is the latest — 
make a first pre -financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [ insert amount (insert amount in words) ], 
except if Article 48 applies.  
From this amount, an amount of EUR [ insert amount (insert amount in words) ], corresponding to 5% of

21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
Not applicable  
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred b y the beneficiary 
for the implementation of the action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency]   
will pay the balance within 90 days  from  receiving the final report (see Article 20.4) , except if Articles 47 
or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the app roval of the final report.  Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  by deducting the total amount 
of pre -financing already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
pre-financing made }. 
At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the  Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
and: 
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the beneficiary together with 
the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary  
- is negative, it will be recovered from the beneficiary.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent —  against any other 
amount owed by the beneficiary to the [Agency, the]  Commission or an [other]  executive agency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1.

Payment is subject to the approval of the final report.  Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content.  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  by deducting the total amount 
of pre -financing already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:

Lump sum > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  794 
 
1. Payments  to be made — No interim payments  
General  Lump Sum actions are divided into several reporting periods with pre -financing payments  
(each reporting period triggering a pre -financing  instead of an interim payment ). 
Only the first pre -financing payment is automatic. Further pre-financing payments  must be 
requested by the coordinator via a statement on the use of the previous pre -financing 
payment (see Article 20 ). 
There are NO interim  payments.  
The balance is paid when the action ends.  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?   
Pre-financing payment  
How much? There is no standard amount (or percentage) for pre -financing payments; the 
amount is fixed in each GA. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payment of the balance  
How much? The amount of the payment of the balance  depends on  the overall financial situation 
at the end of  the action , and in particular :  
 the amount of pre -financing(s) already paid (see Article 21 H2020 General MGA ) 
 cost rejections (  improper implementation of the action ; see Article 42 )  
 grant reduction ( other serious breach es or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud see 
Article 43). 
  The total amount of pre -financing can NOT exceed 90  % of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1 ). 
The further (i.e. second/third/same for more) pre-financing payment (s) will be reduced , if — according to 
the statement on the use of the previous pre -financing payment  — the previous pre -financing was 
insufficiently used : 
 if 70% or more of the previous  pre-financing has been used: the next pre-financing is paid in full  
 if less than  70% of the previous pre -financing  has been used: the next pre-financing will be reduced 
by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 70%.  
Example:  
Consortium with a maximum grant amount of EUR 400 000 (100% reimbursement rate) and 3 reporting 
periods.  
90% limit of the maximum grant amount: EUR 360 000.  
3 Pre-financing payments: EUR 100 000; EUR 120 000 and EUR 140 000.  
Statement on the use of previous pre -financing submitted by the Consortium: 70% of the 1st pre-financing and 
60% of the 2nd pre-financing payment.  
2nd pre-financing payment of EUR 120 000 is paid in full since the consortium used 70% of the 1st pre-financing;  
3rd pre-financing to the coordinator must be reduced because the consortium used only 60% of the 2nd pre-
financing;  
Pre-financing actually used:  EUR 120 000 * 60% = EUR 72 000  
70% of the 2nd pre-financing payment: EUR 120 000 * 70% = EUR 84 000  
Reduction due to 70% consumption rule:  EUR 84 000 – EUR 72 000 = EUR 12 000  
3rd pre-financing  paid to the consortium: EUR 140 000 – EUR 12 000 = EUR 128 000.

BENEFICIARIES  — RELATIONSHIP WITH PARTNERS OF A JOINT ACTION  
41.1 Roles and responsibilities towards the [Commission][Agency]     
The beneficiaries have full responsibility for implementing the action and complying with the Agreement.  
The beneficiaries are jointly and severally liable for the technical implementation  of the action as 
described in Annex 1. If a beneficiary fails to i mplement its part of the action, the other beneficiaries 
become responsible for implementing this part (without being entitled to any additional EU funding for 
doing so), unless the [Commission][Agency]  expressly relieves them of this obligation.  
The financial responsibility  of each beneficiary is governed by Articles 44.   
41.2 Internal division of roles and responsibilities  
The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows:  
(a) Each beneficiary  must:  
(i) keep information  stored in the Participant Portal Beneficiary Register (via the electronic 
exchange system) up to date (see Article 17);  
(ii) inform the coordinator immediately of any events or circumstances likely to affect

1. Division of roles and responsibilities — Responsibilities towards the 
Commission/Agency  
The rules on internal division of roles and responsibilities are similar to the General MGA (see 
Article 41 H2020 General MGA ). 
Since for General  Lump Sum multi -beneficiary actions there is however only one (common) 
financial s tatement (see Article 20 ), there is NO obligation  for the beneficiaries to submit their own 
individual financial statements to the coordinator.  (iii) submit  to the coordinator in good time:  
- the data needed to draw up the technical report (see Article 20);  
- ethics committee opinions and notifications or authorisations for activities raising ethical 
issues (see Article 34);  
- any other documents or information required by the [Agency or the] Commission under 
the Agreement, unless the Agreement requires the beneficiary to submit this information 
directly to the [Agency or the]  Commission.  
(b)  The coordinator  must:  
(i) monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7);  
(ii) act as the intermediary for all communications between the beneficiaries and the 
[Commission][Agency]  (in particular, providing the  [Commission][Agency]  with the 
information described in Article 17), unless the Agreement specifies otherwise;  
(iii) request and review any documents or information required by the [Commission][Agency]   
and verify their completeness and correctness before passing them on to the 
[Commission][Agency] ;  
(iv) submit the deliverables and the report to the [Commission][Agency] (see Articles 19 and 
20);  
(v) ensure that all payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see 
Article 21);  
(vi) inform the [Commission][Agency]  of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, when required 
under the Agreement (see Articles 44 and 50) or requested by the [Agency][Commission] .  
The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above -mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary 
or third part y (including linked third parties).  
[OPTION  to be used  when the coordinator is a secondary or higher education establishment or 
public body and there is an ‘authorisation to administer’ given to a third party created, controlled

1. Rejection of ineligible costs  
The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 42 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since for General Lump Sum grants  the main cost eligibility condition refers to ‘proper 
implementation of the action in accordance with Annex 1’ (see Article  6.1), improper 
implementation leads to the ineligibility  of the costs (NOT reduction of the grant; see also Article 
7). If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, the costs will be considered ineligible 
and rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented.   
 
  ‘Rejection of costs’  will be made for improper implementation  of the action  (see Article 7 ). 
. 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 42 — REJECTION OF INELIGIBLE COSTS  
42.1 Conditions  
 
The [Commission][Agency]   will — at the payment of the balance or afterwards  — reject any costs 
which are ineligible (i.e. if the action as described in Annex 1 is not properly implemented; see Article 6), 
in particular following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 22).  
 
The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant , (see Article 
22.5.2).  
 
42.2 Ineligible  costs to be rejected — Calculation  — Procedure  
 
Ineligible costs will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented . 
 
If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery (see Article 44), the [Commission][Agency ]  will 
formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the 
reasons why (if applicable, together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) . The 
coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — formally notify 
the [Commission][Agency] of its disagreement and the reasons why.  
 
If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery, [Commission][Agency]  will follow the contradictory 
procedure with ‘ pre-infor mation letter ’ set out in Article 44.  
 
42.3 Effects  
 
If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs at the  payment of the balance , it will deduct them from the 
total eligible costs declared, for the action, in the financial statement (see Article 20.4). It will  then 
calculate the payment of the balance as set out in Article 21.4.  
 
If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs after the payment of the balance , it will deduct the amount 
rejected from the total eligible costs declared, by the beneficiary, in the financ ial statement. It will then 
calculate the revised final grant amount as set out in Article 5.4.

 ARTICLE 43 — REDUCTION OF THE GRANT  
43.1 Conditions  
 
The [Commission][Agency]  may — at the payment of the balance  or afterwards  — reduce the 
maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), if:  
(a) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure (including 
submission of false information, failure to provide requested information, breach of ethical 
principles)  or 
(b) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — 
systemic or recurrent e rrors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant ( extension of findings from other grants  to this grant ; see Article 
22.5.2).  
Improper implementation of the action as described in Annex 1 will not lead  to a reduction of the grant but 
to a rejection of costs (see Article 42).  
43.2 Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure  
The amount of the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach.  
Before reduction of the grant, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify a ‘ pre-information letter ’ 
to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
- informing it of its intention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons 
why and  
- inviting it to submit observations  within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the 
observations it has received , it will formally notify  confirmation  of the reduction (if applicable, together 
with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21).  
43.3 Effects  
If the [Commission][Agency]  reduces the grant at the time of  the payment of the balance , it will calculate 
the reduced grant amount for the acti on and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see 
Articles 5.3.4 and 21.4).  
If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant after the payment of the balance , it will calculate the 
revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned (se e Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount 
for the beneficiary concerned is lower than its share of the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency] 
will recover the difference (see Article 44).

Lump sum > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 43  799 1. Reduction of the  grant   
The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 42 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since for General  Lump Sum grants ‘proper implementation of the action in accordanc e 
with Annex 1’ is an eligibility  rule and does NOT lead to the reduction  of the grant  (see also 
Articles 6.1  and 7), the grant can be reduced only in case of other serious breaches of obligations 
or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud ; see Article 43 H2020 General MGA ). 
 
 
  Grant reductions  will be made for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  and serious 
breach es of obligation  other than proper implementation .

Not applicable  
44.1.2   Recovery at payment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recover y (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency]

1. Recovery of undue amounts  
The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 44 H2020 General MGA ). 
The General  Lump Sum multi -beneficiary MGA has, however, the following  specificities : 
Since the coordinator alone is financially responsible (for the entire grant) , the 
Commission/Agency will recover ONLY from it. 
Best practice:  Beneficiaries should foresee internal arrangements (e.g. in the consortium 
agreement)  to redistribute the financial responsibility internally in the consortium in a fair way.  
There is therefore also NO need for a report on the distribution of payments  between beneficiaries.  
 
Specific cases:  
Coordinator with linked third party with joint and several liability — If a linked third party to the 
coordinator has accepted joint and several liability (see Article 14 H2020 General MGA ), the 
Commission/Agency may also recover the amount unduly paid by holding the third party liable — up to 
the maximum EU contribution indicated for the consortium in the estimated budget  (Annex 2) .

 ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries  
49.1.1 Conditions  
The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
— in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.  
49.1.2 Procedure  
The coordinator must immed iately formally notify to the [Commission][Agency] the suspension (see 
Article 52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the expected date of resumption.  
The suspension will take effect  the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency] . 
Once circum stances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately formally notify 
the [Commission][Agency] and request an amendment  of the Agreement to set the date on which the 
action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the 
action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has 
been terminated (see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted  with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency]  
49.2.1 Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency] may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if:  
(a) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed or is suspected of having committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the  Agreement or during the award procedure 
(including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
to provide requested information, breach of ethical principles);  
(b) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to rep resent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — 
systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant ( extension of findings from other grants to this grant ; see Article 
22.5.2), or  
(c) the action is suspected of having lost its scientific or technological relevance.  
49.2.2 Procedure  
Before suspending implementation of the action, the [Commission][Agency] will f ormally notify the 
coordinator or beneficiary concerned:

1. GA s uspension (consortium  or EU) 
The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 49  H2020 
General MGA) . 
The General  Lump Sum MGA has, however, the following  specificit ies: 
Suspension of action implementation has NO specific impact on the eligibility of costs. Costs are 
eligible, if they fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6 — i.e. the action tasks must have been 
carried out as described in Annex 1.  - informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and  
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation  of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
formally notify that the procedure is not cont inued.  
The suspension will take effect  five days after confirmation notification is received (or on a later date 
specified in the notification).  
It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met.  
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be 
amended to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make 
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement 
has already been terminated (see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
This date may be before the date on which the amendment  enters into force.  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 
46). 
Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to terminate 
the Agreement or participati on of a beneficiary (see Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts 
unduly paid (see Article 43 and Article 44).

 MONO -BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 50 — TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT  
50.1 Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiary  
50.1.1  Conditions and procedure  
The beneficiary may terminate the Agreement.  
The beneficiary must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the date the termination will take effect.  This date must be after the notification.  
If no reasons are gi ven or if the [Commission][Agency] considers the reasons do not justify termination, the 
Agreement will be considered to have been ‘ terminated improperly ’. 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification  
50.1.2  Effects  
The benefi ciary must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
Article 20).  
If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be 
reimbursed.  
The [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the final grant amount  (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
under the Agreement.  
In case of  improper termination , the grant will be red uced by 100% (see Article 43).  
After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Section 3 of Chapter 4, Articles 36, 37, 40, 42, 
43  and 44) continue to apply.  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
Not applicable  
50.3 Termination of the Agreement by the [Commission][Agency]    
50.3.1  Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency]  may terminate the Agreement if:  
(a) not applicable  
(b) a change to the beneficiary's legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or 
those of its linked third parties)]  is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the 
action or calls into question the decision to awa rd the grant;

(i) resumption is impossible, or  
(ii)  the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;  
(e) the beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, 
has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law;  
(f) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its  behalf)

(k) the beneficiary (or a natura l person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering or 
any other illegal activity;  
(l) the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to r epresent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure ( 
including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, 
failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles);  
(m)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under sim ilar conditions — 
systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant (‘ extension of findings from other grants to this grant ’; see Article 
22.5.2).  
(n) [OPTION 1 : despite a specific request by the [Commission][Agency], a beneficiary does not 
request — through the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of 
one of its linked third parties or international partners that is in one of the sit uations under points 
(e), (f), (g), (k) and to reallocate its tasks][ OPTION 2 : not applicable].  
50.3.2  Procedure  
Before terminating the Agreement, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify the beneficiary:  
- informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and  
- inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and  in case of Point 
(l.ii) above — to inform the [Commission][Agency]  of the measures to ensure compliance with the 
obligations under the Agreement.

 If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observations it has received, it will formally notify to the beneficiary confirmation of the termination and 
the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that  the procedure is not continued.  
The termination will take effect:  
- for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j), (l.ii) and  (n)above: on the day specified in 
the notification of the confirmation (see above);  
- for terminations under Points (a), (d), (f), (i), (k), (l.i) and (m) above: on the day after the 
notification of the confirmation is received by the beneficiary.  
50.3.3  Effects  
The beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —, submit the final report (see 
Article 20).  
If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see Articles 20.8 and 
50.3.1(l)), the beneficiary may not submit any reports after termination.  
If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive the report within the dead line (see above), no costs will be 
reimbursed  
The [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
under the Agreement.  
This does not affect the [Commission][Agency] ’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose 
administrative and sanctions (Article 53).  
The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

 50.1.2 Effects  
The coordinator must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
Article 20).  
If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be 
reimbursed.  
The [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the final grant amount  (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
Article 21), on the bas is of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
under the Agreement.  
In case of  improper termination , the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular  Section 3 of Chapter 4, Articles 36, 37, 40, 
42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
50.2.1  Conditions and procedure  
The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.  
The coordinator must formally notify  termination to the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52) and 
inform the beneficiary concerned.  
If the coor dinator’s participation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries).  
The notification must include:  
- the reasons why;  
- the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing);  
-  the date the termination takes effect. This date must be after the notification, and  
-  a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reall ocation of the tasks (see Annex 
1) and, if necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination 
takes effect after the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be included 
unless the beneficiary concer ned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must 
propose a new coordinator.  
- a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Annex 
1) and, if necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination 
takes effect after the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be included 
unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must 
propose a new coo rdinator.  
If this information is not given or if the [Commission][Agency]  considers that the reasons do not justify 
termination, the participation will be considered to have been terminated improperly . 
The termination will take effect  on the day specified in the notification.

1. GA t ermination ( consortium ) 
The rules on GA termination are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 50 H2020 General 
MGA). 
 
2. Beneficiary  termination ( consortium ) 
The rules on beneficiary  termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
50 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, the  General  Lump Sum multi-beneficiary MGA has the following  specificities : 
The notification must include a reallocation of the tasks (Annex 1), but NO reallocation of the 
estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned.  The Agency  will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on 
the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the 
Agreement.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs 
will be reimbursed.  
The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
(see Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other 
obligations under the Agreement.  
This does not affect the  [Commission][Agency] ’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to 
impose administrative and sanctions (Article 53).  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency]  (see 
Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
(b) for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries : 
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a request for 
amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Anne x 1) and, if 
necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified 
after the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the 
beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In thi s case the request for amendment must propose a new 
coordinator.  
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question 
the decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicant s), the 
Agreement may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency] , the Agreement is amended  
to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 56).  
After termination, the concerned benefic iary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 
of Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Lump Sum Pilot actions  
What?  Lump Sum Pilot grants  are used in a limited number of cases provided for in the work 
programme /call. They can be research and innovation actions (RIA) , innovation actions (IA) 
or coordination and support actions (CSA) . 
Example s: Specific  call within the Nanotechnologies, Advance Materials, Biotechnology and Advance 
Manufacturing and Processing  topic DT-NMBP -20-2018, some R&I activities in the rail sector ( e.g. topics  S2R-
CFM-IP5-01-2018 and S2R-CFM-CCA-01-2018). 
 ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED [— COMPLEMENTARY GRANT] [ — JOINTLY 
FUNDED ACTION]  
The grant is awarded for the action  entitled  [insert title of the action ] — [insert acronym ] (‘action ’), as 
described in Annex 1.  
[OPTION for complementary grants if foreseen in the work programme:  The grant is a ‘ complementary 
grant ’ to [the grant agreement(s) under the call(s) for proposals [ call i dentifier(s): H2020 — theme —]]

ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS   
 
 
1. Estimated lump sum breakdown  
Since Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use eligible costs, t he Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not have any  
budget categories . Instead, it has a breakdown  of the lump sum, per work package and 
beneficiary . 
The breakdown is used to determine : 
 the share of the  lump sum to which each beneficiary  is entitled for each work package  
Example: Annex 2 sets out EUR 200 000 for work package 1 (WP1). The consortium completed WP1 in the 
first reporting period as described in Annex 1. Therefore, the consortium declares EUR  200 000 for WP1 in 
the periodic reports of period 1. If the Commission confirms that the WP1 was completed as described in 
Annex 1, it will include EUR 200 000 in the periodic payment.  
 the maximum amount for which each beneficiary is liable ( grant reduction ) in case of  
improper implementation of a work package  
Example: In the example above, the Commission carries out a review on the grant in the last reporting 
period. The review concludes that WP1 was not properly implemented because only part of t he activities of 
that work package w ere actually carried out. The Commission will reduce the grant in proportion to the 
improper implementation of WP1 up to a maximum of EUR 200 000  (the share of the lump sum allocated to 
that work package ).  
 the maximum amount for which each beneficiary is liable in case of  improper 
implementation of a work package . ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
TRANSFERS  
4.1 Estimated lump sum breakdown  
The ‘ estimated lump sum breakdown ’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
It contains the lump sum shares, per work package and beneficiary [and linked third party] .  
The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
beneficiaries. It shows the amounts that the [Commission][Agency]  commits to pay if the action is 
implemented properly, regardless of the costs actually incurred.  
4.2 Lump sum share transfers   
The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 can be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
beneficiaries and/or work pa ckages, via an amendment (see Article 55).  
Transfers between work packages are however possible only if:  
- the work packages are not already completed (and declared in a financial statement);  
- the transfers are justified by the technical and scientific impl ementation of the action and  
- a review in accordance with Article 22.1.2 confirms that the amendment does not call into 
question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of 
applicants.  
 
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
Lump sum pilot > Chapter 2 > Articl e 4 817 Example: In the example above, the Commission carries out a technical audit on the grant after the 
payment of the balance. The audit concludes tha t WP2 (value also EUR 200 000) was not implemented as 
indicated in Annex 1. On those grounds , the Commission decides to reduce the grant. Beneficiar ies A and B 
were together responsible for carrying out WP 2 (according to Annex 2 beneficiary A for EUR 150 000 and 
beneficiary B for EUR 50  000). Therefore, each beneficiary  will be liable for their proportion of the work 
package (e.g. in case of a 50% reduction, beneficiary A for EUR 75 000 and Beneficiary B for EUR 25 000) . 
 
2. Lump sum share  transfers  
Unlike  in the General MGA, transfers of Lump Sum Pilot shares  are only possible via a  formal  
amendment.  
The transfer may be:  
 within the same work package (i.e. increasing the share of a beneficiary and decreasing 
the share of another ) 
 between work packages (i.e. increasing the share allocated to a work package and 
decreasing the share of another) . 
Transfers between work packages can only be accepted in exceptional circumstances, if duly 
justified and after a project review .  
Transfers f rom or to a work package which the consortium has already declared as completed in a 
reporting period are NOT allowed.

ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
 
 
1. Grant amount and form of grant   
How much & which form? The Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not use the cost forms  of the 
General MGA, but is a lump sum grant  (see Decisions  C(2017)7149 and C(2017)7151 ).  
The use of the lump sum will be set out in the work programme/call.  
The lump sum will be fixed taking into account the H2020 funding rates . This means that  the 
lump sum fixed in Article 5 does not have to be multiplied again  by the funding rate ; it is 
already the net maximum EU funding.   
The lump sum  is one amount for the entire consortium.  
There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is correctly implemented  (in line with the 
description in Annex 1) , the beneficiaries are entitled to receive th e fixed lump sum  amount . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
5.1 Maximum grant amount   
The ‘ maximum grant amount ’ is EUR  [insert amount (insert amount in words) ]. 
5.2 Form of grant  
The grant takes the form  of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action.  
 
 
 
  The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL  (direct and indirect) costs  for the action and it can NOT be 
increased.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 3 > Article 5.3  819 Lump sum pilot > Chapter 3 > Article 5 .3 
 
 
1. Final grant amount  
For Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same as for  the 
General MGA (see Article 5. 3 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21 ). 
Moreover , since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared cannot be higher than the 
amount fixed in Annex 2  anyways ), there is NO  need to calculate the : 
 limit to the maximum grant amount or  
 reduction due  to the no -profit rule.  5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
The ‘final grant amount ’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented  in accordance 
with the Agreement’s terms and conditions .  
This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
Article 21) — in the following s teps: 
Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of non -
approved work packages  
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
5.3.1   Step 1 — Calculation  of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and 
reduction of non -approved work packages  
The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  are added together.  
The grant is reduced (see Article 43) for all other work packages (i.e. all work packages that have not been 
delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance).  
5.3.2  Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or ser ious breach of 
obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
If the grant is further reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations other than improper implementation; see Article 43) , the [Commission][Agenc y] will calculate 
the reduced grant amount  by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the 
seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) 
from the maximum grant amount  set out in Article 5.1.  
The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
 the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
 the reduced grant amount following Step 2.

1. Revised final grant amount  
For Lump Sum Pilot grants, t he rules on the revised final grant amount are in principle the same 
as for the General MGA  (see Article 5. 4 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since there is no reporting of costs,  the calculations are different  (see Article 21 ). 
 5.4 Revised final grant amount — Calculation  
If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
Article 22) — the [Commission][ Agency]  reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud 
or serious breach of obligations including improper implementation; see Article 43), it will calculate the 
‘revised final grant amount ’ for the beneficiary concerned by the findi ngs. 
This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] by calculating the concerned beneficiary’s share in 
the grant amount reduced in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of 
obligations (see Article 43.2) .

ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTION  
  
 
1. Participants: Appropriate own resources —Third parties involved in the action  
The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable  to the Lump 
Sum Pilot MGA . 
The General MGA  rules on third party involvement are limited in Lump Sum  Pilot actions to 
subcontracting ( Article 13 ), linked third parties ( Article 14 ) and international partners ( Article 
14a). 
The articles  for purchases ( Article 10 ) and in -kind contributions (Articles 11  and 12) are not 
applicable to the Lump Sum Pilot MGA . Beneficiar ies may make purchases and use any in -kind 
contribution s from third parties  following their internal practices but not subject to other rules (as 
long as they are needed  to carry out the work of the action ). 
 
 
 
 ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
IN THE ACTION  
The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
- purchase goods, works and services;  
- use in -kind contributions provided by third parties against payment;  
- use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge;  
- call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
- call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
- call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1  
in accordance with the specific rules set out in Article 10 to 14a.  
In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission][Agency]  and the othe r 
beneficiaries for implementing the action.  
 
 
  For all types of third party involvement (purchases, in-kind contributions,  subcontracts , linked third parties  
and international partners) , the costs  are ALL covered  by the lump sum.  NO other costs will be reimbursed.

ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION  TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
 
 
1. Subcontractin g 
The rules on subcontracting for Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle  the same  as for  the 
General MGA (see Articles 8  and 13 H2020 General MGA ). 
The Lump Sum Pilot MGA has however the following  specificities : 
The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT need to be in cluded in Annex 1  or shown in the table 
of estimated costs in Annex 2 (there is no such table for the Lump Sum Pilot; Annex 2 is not the 
budget, but the estimated lump sum breakdown) . By contrast, the tasks to be subcontracted must 
still be indicated in Annex 1 , as it happens in the General MGA  
The principles of best value for money and no conflict of interest are not explicitly mentioned  in 
Article 13. Nonetheless , they must still be complied with and confirmed by the beneficiaries at 
proposal stage .  
The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
‘other obligations’ . In case of breach, the Commission/Agency may therefore reduce the grant in 
proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).  
The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations which occurred at proposal stage (see 
Article 43 H2020 General MGA ). ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS  
13.1 Specific rules for subcontracting  action tasks  
Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action.  
The tasks to be implemented for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1. The [Commission][Agency]  
may however approve subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55), if:  
- they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and  
- they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
[OPTION for classified information:  Action t asks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission] [Agency]  (see Article 37). ] 
The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,]  the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
and the European Anti -Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
their subcontractors.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
subcontractors.  
13.2 Consequ ences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

ARTICLE 15 — FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THIRD PARTIES  
 
 
1. Financial support to third parties  
The rules for financial support to third parties in Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle the same 
as in the General MGA (see Article 15 H2020 General MGA ). 
Thus, although the minimum conditions for granting financial support  are not  explicitly listed  in 
Article 15 of the Lump Sum Pilot MGA , they must still  be complied with (and confirmed by the 
beneficiaries at proposal stage ).  
Moreover, like under General MGA, the proposal must fix the criteria that the beneficiaries intend 
to apply for their cascading grants (i.e. no more than EUR 60  000 maximum amount per recipient, 
the criteria for determini ng the exact amount of support, the types of activities, the categories of 
recipients  and the  conditions for giving  support)  and th is description  will also become  part of 
Annex 1 of the GA .  
The obligations in Article 15.1 and 15.2 are NOT considered to be  additional cost eligibility 
conditions, but ‘ other obligations’ . In case of breach, t he Commission/Agency may therefore 
reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).   
The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations at proposal stage (see Article 43 H2020 
General MGA ).ARTICLE 15 — FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THIRD PARTIES  
15.1 Rules for providing financial support to third parties  
[OPTION 1 to be used if foreseen in the work programme:  The beneficiaries must ensure that [the 
Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti -Fraud Office 
(OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards the third parties receiving financial 
support.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations u nder Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46  also apply to the third 
parties receiving financial support. ] 
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ] 
15.2 Financial support in the form of prizes  
[OPTION 1 to be used if foreseen in the work programme: The beneficiaries must ensure that  [the 
Agency,] the  Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti -Fraud Office 
(OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22  and 23 also towards the third parties receiving a prize.  
The beneficiaries must ensure that their ob ligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the third 
parties receiving a prize. ]  
[OPTION 2:  Not applicable ] 
15.3 Consequences of non -compliance  
[OPTION 1 to be used if 15.1 and/or 15.2 are applicable: If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations 
under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
Such breaches may also lead to any of  the other measures described in Chapter 6 .]

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 15  824 Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18  
ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
 
 
1. Records and other supporting documentation  
For Lump Sum Pilot actions , beneficiaries do not need to keep  full records on their actual costs ; 
they only need to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation , records) that the 
action tasks (as described in Annex 1) were properly carried  out.  
The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available.  It must be correctly archived — for at 
least 5 years after the balance is paid (three years for grants up to EUR 60  000) or longer if there 
are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or litigation) . In this case , the evidence 
must be kept until they end.  
The records and supporting documentation must:  
 refer to the technical implementation of the action , in line with the accepted standards in 
the respective field (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA ) and 
 
 prove that the tasks or part of the action allocated to the beneficiary in Annex 1 were 
implemented properly (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA ).  
By contrast, timesheets or invoices for costs  actually  incurred are NOT needed.   
 ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default: five][ OPTION 2 for low value grants: 
three] years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate records and other supporting 
documentation  to prove the proper implementation of the action . 
They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
investigations (see Article 22).  
If there are on -going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other p ursuits of claims under the 
Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. D igital and digitalised documents are considered 
originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission][Agency]  may accept non -
original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance  
Records and other su pporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation of the action 
must be in line with the accepted standards in the respective field.  
The beneficiaries do not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the act ion. 
18.2 Consequences of non -compliance  
If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) . 
Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 . 
 
 If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
reduced  (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

1. Reports  
What & When?  For Lump  Sum Pilot actions, the coordinator must submit  a periodic report  after 
the end of each reporting period  (including the final one) . Each beneficiary [and each linked third party]  must certify  that: 
- the information provided is full, reliable and true;  
- the work packages have been completed and that the action in general has been 
properly implemented (see Article 7);  
- the proper implementation can be substantiated by adequate records and 
supporting documentation (see Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see 
Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see 
Article 22). 
(ii) an explan ation of the use of resources : not applicable ;

EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20  827 Each report is composed of a technical and  a financial report  (like in the General MGA ). However, 
unlike in the General MGA, beneficiaries do not de clare costs  but their lump sum shares (as set 
out in Annex 2) , for the  work packages completed during that reporting period.   
Work packages can be declared only once fully completed (as described in Annex 1 ). If a work 
package is carried out by several beneficiaries, they cannot declare it until all of them have 
completed it.  
Example:  
Grant for a consortium with a maximum  grant amount of EUR 3 000 000 and the following breakdown per work 
package and beneficia ry: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Annex 1 of the grant agreement indicates that at the end of the first reporting period WP1, WP2 and WP3 should 
have been completed. WP4 and WP5 should have been initiated.  
At the end of the first reporting period (RP1) the actual situation is as follows:  
 
  WP1 WP2 WP3 WP4 WP5 
Beneficiary A  Completed      Initiated  Initiated  
Beneficiary B    Completed  Completed  Not initiated    
Beneficiary C  Completed  Initiated    Initiated    
Beneficiary D    Completed    Compl eted   
 
Since  the beneficiaries can only declare completed work packages, the y can only declare the amounts for WP1 
and WP3. They cannot declare any amount for  the WP2, WP4 or WP5, even if they are initiated, because they 
are not completed.  
Partial work packages are allowed only in the following two situations : 
 beneficiary termination  — terminated  beneficiar ies may declare (in the termination report) 
shares for on-going work packages , provided that their part was completed in accordance 
with Annex 1  (see Article 50 ).  
 last reporting period  — at the end of the action, beneficiaries may exceptionally  also 
declare partial shares for work packages that were not completed, for example due to 
technical reasons.  
Best practice:  In case of doubt, t he coordinator should  contact the Commission/Agency about 
partial work packages .    WP1 WP2 WP3 WP4 WP5 WP6 WP7 WP8 Total  
Beneficiary A  250.000      50.000  300.000  250.000    300.000  1.150.000  
Beneficiary B    250.000  350.000  50.000      100.000  150.000  900.000  
Beneficiary C  100.000  100.000    50.000    280.000      530.000  
Beneficiary  D   120.000    50.000      100.000  150.000  420.000  
Total  350.000  470.000  350.000  200.000  300.000  530.000  200.000  600.000  3.000.000

How?  Each periodic report must be prepared  by the coordinator  and the  other  beneficiaries  
together , directly  in the Funding & Tenders Portal ). 
In practice, the following steps will apply for the fi nancial part:  
Step 1  — The coordinator will indicate in the Funding & Tenders  Portal  which work packages 
have been fully accomplished during the  reporting period.  
Step 2 — The beneficiaries will have to sign individual financial statement s to confirm proper 
implementation of th ose work package(s) and submit them to the coordinator. All of them will 
be part of the financial report for the reporting period concerned .  
Step 3  — The coordinator will submit both the technical and the financial report to the  
Commission/Agency.  
 
 
 The Commission/Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares in the last reporting period if:  
 the situation could have been solved via an amendment  
Example:  The consortium argues that they did not have enough time to complete the WP. The 
duration of the action could have been extended via an amendment for the consortium to have enough 
time. 
 non-implementation is linked to financial reasons  
Exam ple: The project resulted to be more expensive than initially expected and t he consortium 
decided to stop the work in some WPs.

[…] 
21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
Interim payments pay the lump sum shares for work packages completed during the corresponding 
reporting periods.   
The [Commission] [Agency]  will pay to the coordinator the amount due as interim payment  within 90 days 
from receiving the periodic report (see Article 20.3) , except if Articles 47 or 48 apply.  
Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report and the lump sum shares and work packages 
declared. Their approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or 
correctness of their content.  
Work packages that have not been completed in time or cannot be approved at the time of an interim 
payment may be submitted (again) for the next reporting period (or any other future reporting period, after 
they have been completed).  
The amount due as inte rim payment  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages  
Step 2 — Limit to  90% of the maximum grant amount  
21.3.1  Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages  
The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
beneficiaries [and linked third parties]  for the concerned reporting period are added toget her. 
21.3.2  Step 2 — Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount  
The total amount of pre -financing and interim payments must not exceed 90% of the maximum grant 
amount set out in Article 5.1. The maximum amount for the interim payment will be calculated as fo llows:  
{90% of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1)  
minus  
{pre-financing and previous interim payments}}.  
21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund  
The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the 
action.  
If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount  (see Article 5.3), the 
payment of the balance takes the form of a recov ery (see Article 44).  
If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency]  
will pay the balance within 90 days  from  receiving the final report (see Article 20.4) , except if Articles 47 
or 48 apply.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  830  
 
1. Payments  to be made   
The rules on payments are in principle the same as in the General MGA (one pre -financing 
payment, interim payments at the end of each reporting period, and a final payment of the 
balance).  
 
2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?   
Interim  payment s 
How much?  The amount of the interim payment s will be calculated by the Commission/Agency 
on the basis of the financial statements  and the payments already made.  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Article  21.3 H2020 General MGA ), however with 
the following specificit ies: Payment is subject to the approval of the final report and the lump sum shares and work packages 
declared.  Their approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or 
correctness of their content.  
Incomplete work packages and  work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be approved at the 
payment of the balance will reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).  
The amount due as the balance  is calculated by the [Commission][Agency]  by deducting the total 
amount of pre -financing and interim payments (if any) already made, from the final grant amount 
determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
{final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
minus  
{pre-financing and interim payments (if any) made} }. 
At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
and: 
- if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the coordinator together 
with the amount due as the balance;  
- if the balance is negative (payment of the balanc e taking the form of recovery): it will be 
deducted from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
- is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator  
- is negative, it will be recovered.  
The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiaries’ consent —  against any other 
amount owed by a beneficiary to the [Agency, the]  Commission or an [other]  executive agency (under the 
EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for that beneficiary,  in the estima ted 
lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2).

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  831 Step 1 ( Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs , but simply sums up the lump sum shares for the accepted work packages for this 
reporting period  (the lump sum shares in Annex 2 already take into account the reimbursement 
rate; no need to  apply it again ). Partial work packages will NOT be accepted; the e ntire work 
package (i.e. work of all beneficiaries) needs to be done.  
 
Beneficiary termination  
How much?  The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated by the 
Commission/Agency on the basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the 
report on the distribution of payments . 
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 21.3 , 44.1.1 , 50.2.2  and 50.3.3 H2020 
General MGA ), however with the following specificit ies: 
Step 1 (Calculation of the accep ted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs , but simply sums up all the lump sum shares for the beneficiary’s accepted work 
packages. Partial work packages can be accepted (i.e. shares for work packages where the 
benefi ciary's part is completed ).  
Exceptionally , the Commission/Agency may accept also part of a lump sum share for a work 
package in which the beneficiary has not carried out all its tasks.   
Example: The beneficiary requests terminating its participation in the action because a fire devastated its 
laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers used for the action were located. Therefore, 
the beneficiary cannot complete its tasks in the on-going work packages due to force majeure (see Article 5 1 
H2020 General MGA ). On those grounds, the Commission decides to accept for that beneficiary a part of the 
lump sum shares for the on -going work packages proportionate to the tasks carried out by the beneficiary in 
those work packages.  
Not completed work packages (or not completed parts of them) can be finished and declared later 
on. 
 
Example for calculating the amount due at  beneficiary termination:  
Grant with f our beneficiaries (A, B, C, D ). 
Maximum grant amount : EUR 3  000  000.

The participation of beneficiary B is terminated before the end of the first reporting period. At the time when the 
termination takes effect beneficiary B had fully completed its tasks for WP2 and WP3 and initiated its tasks for WP4. 
The coordinator had transferred EUR 650 000 as pre -financing to beneficiary B.  
Amount due:  
Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP2 + WP3 = EUR 600  000. 
Beneficiary B amount  due: EUR 600 000. 
Beneficiary balance : 
Payments received by beneficiary B (according to the report on the distribution of payments): EUR  650 000.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  832 Beneficiary B balance: EUR 600  000 (amount due ) - EUR 650 000 (payments received) = EUR -50 000 (excess 
payments of EUR 50 000) . 
Recovery:  
Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 50 000 (negative  balance of EUR 50 000 must be returned to the 
consortium; otherwise Commission/Agency will start a recovery procedure).  
 
Payment of the balance  
How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
be calculated by the Commission/Agency on the basis of the financial statements, the final grant 
amount , the payments already made  and the report on the d istribution of payments  
The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Article s 5.3, 21.4 and 44.1.2  H2020 General MGA ), 
however with the following specificities : 
Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
eligible costs but simply sums up all the lump sum shares for the accepted work packages.  Partial 
work packages can exceptionally be accepted (i.e. shares f or work packages that were not 
completed, for example due to technical reasons).  
 
Steps 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
do not apply to Lump Sum Pilot grants.  
Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other  than non-implementation  
(because non -implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
All other steps follow the General MGA.  
 
Example for ca lculating the payment of the balance : 
Grant with f our beneficiaries (A, B, C, D ). 
Maximum grant amount : EUR 3  000  000.

 The Commission/Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares in the last reporting period if:  
 the situation could h ave been solved via an amendment  
Example:  The consortium argues that  they did not have enough time to complete the WP. The 
duration of the action could have been extended via an amendment for the consortium to have 
enough time.  
 non-implementation is linked to financial reasons  
Example:  The project resulted to be more expen sive than initially expected and the consortium 
decided to stop the work in some WPs.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21  833 Case 1: 
At the end of the action, WP 7 was not completed as described in Annex 1. The Commission decides to reduce 50 %  
of WP7,  corresponding to the  proportion of the undelivered part of that work package . All other work packages were 
completed as described in Annex 1. In addition, the consortium breached a n important  confidentiality obligation 
under Article 36. The Commission decides to reduce the maximum grant amount by 10 % for that rea son. 
Final grant amount:  
Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP1 + WP2 + WP3 + WP4 + WP5 + WP6 + 50 % WP7 + WP8 = EUR 
2 900  000. 
Amount resulting from Step 1 : EUR 2 900  000. 
Grant reduction for other breaches: 10% grant reduction for the action  = maximum grant amount – 10 % 
(reduction) = 3 000 000 – 300 000 = EUR 2  700 000. 
Amount resulting from Step 2 : EUR 2 700  000. 
Lower amount of the two:  EUR 2 700  000. 
Final grant amount : = EUR 2 700  000. 
 
Case 2: 
The consortium decides to terminate the GA due to technical difficulties that result in the action no longer being 
viable. The termination takes effect before the end of the first reporting period. At the moment of termination the 
state of play of each wor k package is as follows:  
 
  WP1 WP2 WP3 WP4 WP5 WP6, WP7, WP8  
Beneficiary A  Completed      Initiated  Initiated  Not initiated  
Beneficiary B    Completed  Completed  Not initiated    Not initiated  
Beneficiary C  Completed  Not initiated    Not initiated    Not initiated  
Beneficiary D    Completed    Completed    Not initiated  
 
In the reports, t he consortium justifies that for WP2 the work of beneficiary B and beneficiary D were fully 
accomplished in accordance with Annex 1, that the work of beneficiary C in this work package was ancillary and that 
beneficiary C stopped in fact collaborating in the action. On those grounds , the Commission accepts exceptionally 
370 000 EUR for WP2.  
Final grant amount:  
Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP1 + WP2 (part) + WP3 = 350 000 + 370 000 + 350 000 = EUR 1 
070 000 
No grant reductions for other breaches .  
Final grant amount : EUR 1 070  000.  
 
Case 3 : 
Work package 2 was not carried out (i.e. representing a total lump sum share of EUR 470 000) and therefore the 
Commission reduced the grant accordingly.  
Final grant amount:  
Lump sum shares for accepted work packages : WP1 + WP3 + WP4 + WP5 + WP6 + WP7 + WP 8 = EUR 2  530 000. 
No grant reductions for other breaches.  
Final grant amount: EUR 2  530  000 ( beneficiary shares : A = EUR 1 150 000; B  = EUR 650 000; C  = EUR 430 000; 
D = EUR 300  000). 
Balance & Guarantee Fund release : 
Payments made: EUR 2  700  000.  
Balance : EUR 2  530  000 (final grant amount) - EUR 2  700  000 (payments made) = EUR -170  000 (excess payments 
of EUR 170  000). 
Offsetting against Guarantee Fund release : EUR 1 70 000  - EUR 150  000 = EUR 20  000 
Recovery:  
Amount to be recovered from the consor tium:  EUR 20 000 (negative balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by 
coordinator, otherwise Commission  will start a recovery procedure against the beneficiaries that received excess 
funding) . 
Recovery from coordinator:  
The coordinator does not reimburse the Commission  and sends the report on the distribution of the payments among 
beneficiaries  (distribution: A= EUR 977  500; B= EUR 765  000; C = EUR 450  500; D= EUR 357  000).

EXTENSION OF FINDINGS  
 
 
1. Checks , reviews and audits  
The rules on checks, reviews and audits  are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 22 H2020 General MGA ). 
However, since Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use eligible costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
 there will be no financial  checks, reviews, or audits  to check costs  (since b eneficiaries have 
no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action , even if they remain subject to 
the accounting rules under the a pplicable national law).  
 checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the technical  implementation of the action  (in 
particular full accomplishment of the work packages as described in Annex 1 of the GA), or 
on other aspects of the grant agreement , such as promoting the action, visibility of EU 
funding, ethics and research integrity, dissemination and exploitation of results, 
management of intellectual property , etc. 
Specific cases (audits):  
Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Comm ission/Agency may also 
audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items 
for which it has fixed unit costs, flat -rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to 
assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for the 
beneficiaries that were a udited . ARTICLE 22 — CHECKS, REVIEWS, AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS — EXTENSION OF

 ARTICLE 44 — RECOVERY OF UNDUE AMOUNTS  
44.1 Amount to be recovered — Calculation  — Procedure  
The [Commission][Agency]  will — after termination of a beneficiary’s participation, at the  payment 
of the balance  or afterwards  — claim back any amount that was paid, but is not due under the 
Agreement.  
Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt [OPTION if 
Article 14 applies: (including undue amounts paid by the [Commission] [Agency]  for lump sum shares 
declared by its linked third parties) ], except for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see Article 
21.4).  
44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation  
If recovery takes place after term ination of a beneficiary’s participation (including the coordinator), the 
[Commission][Agency] will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned, by formally 
notifying it a debit note (see Article 50.2 and  50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
terms and the date for payment.  
If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Agency or the] Commission will 
recover the amount:  
(d) by ‘offsetting ’ it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the 
beneficiary concerned by the [Agency, the] Commission or an [other] executive agency (from the 
EU or Euratom budget).  
In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial i nterests, the [Agency or the] 
Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
(e) [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
[Commission][Agency]: if a linked third party has accepted j oint and several liability (see Article 
14), by holding the third party liable up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the linked 
third party, in the estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2) and/or ][OPTION 2: not 
applicable; ]  
(f) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 
299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty] 
and Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
If payment is  not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
be increased by late-payment interest  at the rate set out in Article  21.11,  from the day following the 
payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the [Agency  or the]  Commission receives full 
payment of the amount.  
Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late -payment interest and the n against 
the principal.  
Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 
2007/64/EC34 applies.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 44  838  44.1.2  Recovery at payment of the balance  
If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency]  
will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter ’ to the coordinator:  
- informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the rea sons why;  
- specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
Guarantee Fund;  
- requesting the coordinator to submit a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries 
within 30 days of receiving notification, and  
- inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
If no observations are submitted or the [Commission][Agency]  decides to pursue recovery despite the 
observations it has received , it will confirm r ecovery  (together with the notification of amounts due; see 
Article 21.5) and:  
- pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
Fund,  if the difference is positive  or 
- formally notify to the coordinator a debit  note for the difference between the amount to be 
recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative . This 
note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission][A gency]  by the date in the debit note and has not 
submitted the report on the distribution of payments: the [Agency or the] Commission will recover the 
amount set out in the debit note from the coordinator (see below).  
If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission][Agency] by the date in the debit note, but has 
submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the [Commission][Agency] will: 
(c) identify the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative:  
{{{{beneficiary’s approved l ump sum shares  
[plus  
its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares] }, 
divided by  
the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for approved work packages 
calculated according to Article 5.3.1}  
multiplied by  
the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) }, 
minus  
{pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary} }. 
(d) formally notify to each beneficiary identified according to point (a) a debit note  specifying the 
terms and date for payment. The amount of the debit note is calculated as follows:  
{{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned  
divided by  
the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)}  
multiplied by  
the amount set out in the debit note formally notified to the coordinator}.

1. Recovery of undue amounts  
The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
Article 44 H2020 General MGA ).  
However,  since for Lump Sum Pilot grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are 
different (see Article 21 ).

44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
If, for a beneficiary, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5) is lower than its share of the final grant 
amount, it must repay the difference to the [Commission][Agency].  
The beneficiary's share of the final grant amount is calculated as follows:  
{beneficiary’s approved lump sum shares  
[plus  
its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares] } 
divided by  
the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for approved work packages calculated

ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
 
 
1. Suspension of the payment deadline ( EU) 
The rules on the suspension of the payment dea dline are in principle the same as in the General 
MGA (see Article 47 H2020 General MGA ).  
The Lump Sum Pilot MGA has, however, the following specificities : 
Since  there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could  be doubts, the suspension 
ground for Lump Sum Pilot grants targets more generally any kinds of  doubts about the amount s 
requested for payment (including doubts linked to work package implementation) .  ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE   
47.1 Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency]  may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 
21.4) if a request for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:   
(a) it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Ar ticle 20);   
(b) the technical or financial report has not been submitted or is not complete or additional 
information is needed, or  
(c) there is doubt about amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) and 
additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary.  
47.2 Procedure  
The [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.   
The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the [Commission][Agency] (see Ar ticle 52).   
If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
and the remaining period will resume.  
If the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the [Commission][Agency]  if the 
suspension will continue.   
If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non -compliance of the technical or financial report 
(see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, 
the [Commission][Agency]  may also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see 
Article 50.3.1(l)).

ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
 ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries  
49.1.1  Conditions  
The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it if exceptional circumstances 
— in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.  
49.1.2  Procedure  
The coordinator must immediately formally notify to the [Commission ][Agency ] the suspension (see 
Article 52), stating:  
- the reasons why and  
- the expected date of resumption.  
The suspension will take effect  the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency] . 
Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately formally 
notify the [Commission][Agency]  and request an amendment  of the Agreement to set the date on which 
the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the acti on and make other changes necessary to adapt 
the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a 
beneficiary has been terminated (see Article 50).  
The suspension will be lifted  with effect from the resumption d ate set out in the amendment. This date 
may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
work packages may be started.  
49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency]  
49.2.1   Conditions  
The [Commission][Agency]  may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if:  
(a) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed or is suspected of having committed:  
(i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
(ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure 
(including improper implementation of the action, su bmission of false information, 
failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles);   
(b) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded  to it under similar conditions — 
systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
material impact on this grant  (extension of findings from other grants to this grant ; see Article 
22.5.2), or  
(c) the action is suspected of having lost its scientific or technological relevance.

1. GA suspe nsion (consortium  or EU) 
The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 4 9 H2020 
General MGA ).  
For full GA suspension ( action is entirely suspended ), all o n-going work packages must be 
interrupted and NO new work packages may be started.  
For partial  GA suspensions other work packages may be continued and new work packages may 
be started(except for those covered by the suspension).   
However, partial  suspension s may have an indirect effect on other work packages, in the sense 
that it might not be possible to fully complete them (and thus not be possible to declare them for 
the reporting period — unless it is already the end of the action; see Articles 20  and 21).  
Example:  A fire caused some damage to an equipment of a beneficiary which is used for a set of chemical 3D -
analyses (large part of WP2) which are then needed for further experiments in WP4 and WP5. The consortium 
therefore requests that the part of the action that is affected (WP3) is suspended until the equipment is restored. 
The other beneficiaries may continue to work on the other work packages (WP4 and WP5). However, i f these work 
packages cannot be fully completed at the end of the reporting period because the WP3 continues to be suspended, 
the lump sum shares for WP4 and WP5 cannot be declared by the beneficiaries.  49.2.2  Procedure  
 
Before suspending implementation of the action, the [Commission][Agency]  will formally notify the 
coordinator  or beneficiary concerned : 
 
- informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and  
 
- inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
 
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
observations it has received , it will formally notify confirmation  of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
formally notify that the procedure is not continued.  
 
The suspension will take effect  five days after confirmation  notification is received (or on a later date 
specified in the notification).  
 
It will be lifted  if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met.  
 
The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the liftin g and the Agreement will be 
amended  to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make 
other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55)  — unless the Agreement 
has already been te rminated (see Article 50) . 
 
The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date may 
be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
 
During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
work packages may be started.  
 
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission] [Agency] (see Article 
46). 
 
Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission][Agency] 's right to terminate the 
Agreement or participation of a beneficiary (see Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly 
paid (see Articles 43  and 44).

50.1.2  Effects  
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i)  a periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) and  
(ii)  the final report (see Article 20.4).  
If the [Commission][Agency]  does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), only lump sum 
shares included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account.  
The [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the final grant amount  (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
Article 21.4), on the basis of the reports submitted and compliance with other obligations under the 
Agreement. Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed before termination will be accepted 
— unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the [Commission][Agency] . 
Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
After te rmination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
36, 37, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.  
50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
[…] 
50.2.2  Effects  
The coordinator must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and  
(ii) if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘ termination report ’ from the 
beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an overview of 
the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20.3 and 20.4).  
The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting 
period (see Article 20.3).  
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question the 
decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatm ent of applicants), the Agreement may 
be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency] , the Agreement is amended  to 
introduce the necessary changes (see Article 55).  
The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the 
payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amoun t. 
The amount which is due  is cal culated in the following steps:  
EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement:  V5.2 – 26.06.2019  Lump Sum Pilot MGA  
Lump sum pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50  844  Step 1 —  Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages  
The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by adding the lump sum shares 
(see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the beneficiary [and its 
linked third parties]  in the termination report . 
Only lump sum shares for work packages fully  completed by the beneficiary before 
termination will be approved — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the 
[Commission][Agency] . 
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations  
If the grant is re duced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
breach of obligations other than non -implementation of the action; see Article 43) , 
the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the reduced grant amount for the 
beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the 
seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in 
accordance with Article 43.2) from the gr ant amount for the beneficiary.  
The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.  
[…] 
50.3 Termination of the Agreement or of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the 
[Commission][Agency]    
[…] 
50.3.3  Effects  
(b) for termination of the Agreement :  
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(i) a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) 
and 
(ii) a final report (see Article 20.4).  
If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see Articles 20.8 and 
50.3.1(l)), the coordinator may not submit any reports after termination.  
If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), only lump 
sum shares in cluded in an approved periodic report will be taken into account.  
The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
(see Article 21.4), on the basis of the reports submitted and compliance with other obligations under 
the Agreement. Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed before termination will be 
accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the [Commission][Agency] . 
This does not affect the  [Commission][Agency] ’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to 
impose administrative sanctions (Article 45).  
The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency]  (see 
Article 46).  
After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue t o apply.

Lump sum pilot > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50  845  (c) for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries : 
The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit:  
(iv) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned;  
(v) a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
the estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annexes 1and  2) and, if necessary, the addition of 
one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified  after the period set 
out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the beneficiary 
concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose a new 
coordinator, and  
(vi)  if termination takes effect during the per iod set out in Article 3, a termination report  from 
the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an 
overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20).  
The information in t he termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next 
reporting period (see Article 20.3).  
If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency]  (because it calls into question 
the decision awarding the grant or bre aches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the 
Agreement may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c).  
If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency] , the Agreement is amended  
to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 56).  
The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if 
the (pre -financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amount.  
The amount which is due  is calculated in the following steps:  
Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work  
The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by adding the lump sum shares 
(see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the beneficiary [and 
its linked third parties]  in the termination report.   
Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed by the beneficiary 
before termination will be approved — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by 
the [Commission][Agency] . 
Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
obligations  
 
If the grant is reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
breach of obligations other than non -implementation of the action; see Article 43) , 
the [Commission][Agency]  will calculate the reduced grant amount for the 
beneficiar y by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to 
the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in 
accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary.  
 
The amount due will be the  lower of the two amounts.
