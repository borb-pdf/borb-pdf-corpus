      It is important to remember that ifres in high-rise buildings are rare and that most 
      ifres do not spread further than one or two rooms. This type of building is 
      designed to contain and prevent ifre from spreading.
      Make sure you know ifre safety procedures and evacuation plans for your building.
      Contact the building manager or responsible person for your building for further 
      information and advice.

                    DO:                              DON’T:
          DO alert everyone else             DON’T open doors looking 
          and leave the lfat, closing          for the source of the ifre
          doors behind you                    DON’T stop to gather 
          DO use the stairs to exit –         personal belongings
          never be tempted to use             DON’T use a balcony to 
          the lift                             escape, unless it is part of

          999 when you are out of             DON’T go back into the 
          the building                         building until you have 
                                               been told it is safe to do so
      If a ifre breaks out elsewhere in the building
        The best way to keep safe is to follow the evacuation plan for your building.
        If your lfat becomes affected by smoke, leave at once, closing windows and 
        doors behind you.
        If you have to leave the building, use the staircase and never the lift.
        If you have to move through smoke, keep as low as possible where the air is 
        cleaner.
      If you do not have a smoke alarm in your lfat, or need some more advice, please

    Things you can do
    Everyone you live with must know what to do if a ifre breaks 
    out, so you can all escape as quickly and safely as possible.
      Plan your escape route together, so everyone knows what to do.
      Make sure passages and stairways are always clear of things 
      like rubbish bags, prams, bikes, mobility scooters or furniture. 
      Fire smoke makes it dififcult to see ahead, so these big objects 
      could stop people escaping.
    Electrical goods
      Electrical items can start ifres if they’re faulty or used incorrectly.
      Make sure USB chargers for e-cigarettes, smartphones, tablets, 
      laptops and other devices are used in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
      instructions.
      Watch out for warning signs like lfickering lights, hot plugs or worn cables.
    Smoking
      Don’t leave lit cigarettes unattended and make sure they’re stubbed out. 
      Never smoke in bed.
      Keep matches out of the reach of children.
    Cooking
      Never leave cooking unattended.
      Never ifll a chip pan more than a third full of fat or oil.
    Portable heating
      Never use heaters to dry clothes – and make sure they stand on a stable 
      surface.
    Safe storage
      Always store motorcycles or petrol cans in a safe store or garage.
      Before you go to bed
        Unplug all portable heaters.
        Make sure all cigarettes are put out. Leave ashtrays outside if you’re unsure. 
        Close the doors to all rooms. This should slow the spread of ifre and smoke if a 
        ifre does break out.
      Are you at risk?
      When a ifre breaks out, every second 
      is critical to your survival. If you have a 
      disability, a serious illness or you’re 
      just a lot slower than you were when 
      you were younger then the risk is a bit 
      higher, but the good news is that 
      there’s a lot we can do to help.
