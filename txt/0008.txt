            *
       All 3  and 4 year olds are entitled to 15 hours of free childcare 
       through the universal Free Entitlement. From September 
       2017, working parents of 3 and 4 year olds could be entitled 
       to an additional 15 hours of free childcare. 
       Parents will need to meet eligibility criteria for the additional 15 hours free 
       childcare. These include:
         As a minimum you both (or one parent in lone parent families) earn the 
         equivalent to 16 hours at National Minimum or Living Wage over the 
         coming three months. As a maximum neither one of you earns more 
         than £100,000 a year.
         Where one parent meets the income criteria and the other is unable to 
         work because they are disabled, have caring responsibilities or have been 
         assessed as having limited capability to work, you may still be eligible. 
       If eligible, you will need to apply the term before you would like to use 
       your additional hours.
