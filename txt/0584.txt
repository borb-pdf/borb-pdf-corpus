    The ABC
    of Electronic Invoice

                What is an                            It’s a commercial document with tax implications that is generated, expressed and transferred electronically. The electronic 
                electronic                            invoice differs from the paper invoice and from the digital invoice because it is created through a digital system that uses 
                                                      “XML” ifles to generate, express and transfer it instead of a printing company authorized by the General Directorate of 
                invoice?                              Taxation.
                                                      It’s imperative to note that these invoices have the same oiffcial validity and judicial value in the same conditions as the 
                                                      authorized paper invoices.
            How has it been implemented?                                                                 Legal framework: Background of the Resolution DGT-R-48-2016 
            Since 2003, the General Directorate of Taxation of the 
            Ministry of Finance introduced the possibility of producing                                                                                                                                  DGT-R-48-2016

            deifning the guidelines for the use of the electronic invoices.

            It’s imperative to note that the taxpayers who decided to 
            implement this type of invoice since 2009, according to the                                   What happend after the issuance of the Resolution DGT-R-48-2016?

            the changes indicated, because while this resolution was not 
            in effect if any invoices were produced under that resolution, 
            such invoices would be unauthorized.

      backup option.

      a preprinted voucher issued by an authorized 
      printing company, it must include the legend 
      “provisional proof”, these vouchers must be used 
      only when it is impossible to use the system to 
      issue electronic vouchers for reasons beyond the 
      scope of the issuer.
      It is stipulated that, once the contingency has been 
      overcome, the electronic vouchers must be issued. 
      For this purpose, the issuer of the voucher has a 
      period of time of no more than two days from the 
      habilitation of the systems to produce the voucher 
      in an electronic form.
