OPERATIONS OF TH E IEEE PUBLICATION SERVICES  
AND PRODUCTS BOARD  
INTRODUCTION  
IEEE Incorporation  
IEEE is incorporated under the New York State Not -for-Profit Corporation Law. The 
text of that law changes from time to time; the IEEE Executive Director should be 
consulted prior to taking any action that relates to that law.  
Governance  
IEEE Bylaw I -300. Paragraphs 1 and 2  
Governance . The policies, procedures, rules and regulations by which the IEEE and its 
organizational units are governed are embodied in the following documents. The IEEE Certificate 
of Incorporation legally establishes the IEEE. The IEEE Constitution, which can be app roved and 
amended only by the voting members of the IEEE, contains IEEE’s fundamental objectives and 
organization. Implementation of the constitutional provisions by specific organizational units and 
their policies is contained in these IEEE Bylaws, which are approved and amended by the IEEE 
Board of Directors. The IEEE Policies contains more detailed statements of specific policies, 
objectives and procedures which may be approved only by the IEEE Board of Directors.  
The precedence of these documents should be remembered by all those engaged in IEEE 
management duties. The IEEE Bylaws shall not be in conflict with the New York Not -For-Profit 
Corporation Law, the IEEE Certificate of Incorporation, or the IEEE Constitutio n. The IEEE 
Policies must conform to the provisions of all these documents. Accordingly, additional 
documents governing organizational units such as operations manuals, policy statements and 
organizational unit bylaws shall conform to and not conflict with  the provisions of the IEEE 
governing documents cited above.  
The IEEE Bylaws and Policies applying to the Publication Services and Products are 
proposed and amended by the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board 
(PSPB), with final approval by the IEEE Board of Directors.  
PSPB Operations Manual  
IEEE Bylaw I -303.9  
Major Board Operating Procedures . Each Major Board shall adopt operating procedures that 
are responsive to the needs of such Major Board for the purpose of governing its operations and 
administration. These operating procedures shall be maintained in an Operations Manual and 
shall conform to and not conflict with the IEEE governance documents described in Bylaw I -300. 
The Operations Manuals or any amendments to its procedures shall not be adopted until such 
Operations Manuals or any amendments have been submitted to and reviewed by the IEEE 
Governance Committee.  The minimum required information to be contained in the Major Board 
Operations Manuals shall be specified in the IEEE Policies.  
The PSPB Operations Manual follows the mandate of IEEE Bylaw I -303.9 and is 
arranged in eight sections, each covering a different facet of PSPB. The Manual 
contains only those items that directly affect the operations of PSPB and the 
decisions of PSPB on m atters delegated to it by the IEEE Board of Directors, 
including guidelines for publication services and products of IEEE and its 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   5 organizational units. These guidelines amplify the requirements of IEEE Policie s, 
particularly the IEEE Principles of Ethical Publishing.  
IEEE Principles of Ethical Publishing  
IEEE considers the principles guiding its publications (periodicals and conference 
proceedings) to be the underlying foundation of its technical activities. These 
publication principles, detailed in Section 8 of this manual, are expressed below as 
guidelin es for all activity in IEEE publications, and are formulated in the context of 
the IEEE Code of Ethics. These guidelines are intended for the benefit of editors, 
technical program committee chairs, authors, referees, and all others involved in 
the publicat ion process.   
Editors of IEEE periodicals and conference technical program chairs provide 
oversight and stewardship of IEEE periodicals and conferences. In doing so they 
shall uphold the IEEE Code of Ethics and take no coercive actions toward authors 
and referees and sh all adhere to the requirements and guidelines outlined in this 
manual. Editorial decisions shall be fair, reasonable, and justifiable. These 
individuals shall perform their duties with collegiality and respect for authors and 
referees, as well as for other  editors and professional staff.  
Authors of IEEE publications, whether members of IEEE or otherwise, are expected 
to accept the basic definitions and guidelines of honest and proper behavior 
addressed by the requirements and guidelines in this manual. Fair and reasonable 
credit should be given to related technical work by others, and any reproduction of 
the work of others should be done with proper crediting and within acceptable 
norms for citation. These guidelines should be interpreted as providing direction for 
authors intending to publ ish their work in IEEE publications.  
Referees of IEEE publications provide an invaluable service to editors of IEEE 
periodicals and conference technical program chairs. While referees generally act as 
volunteers to uphold the integrity of the IEEE article review process, expectations 
exist th at align with the principles of ethical publishing put forth in this manual. 
Foremost among these expectations is that referees maintain a posture of 
collegiality in providing reviews of articles, without intent to influence bibliometric 
measures, citation  indices, or other such metrics . 
Perceived violations of these guiding principles by editors, technical program 
committee chairs, authors, referees, or others involved in the publication process 
should be reported to the Vice President – Publications Products and Services, 
either directly  or through a reporting chain beginning with a publication editor or 
conference general chair. Subsequent action is at the discretion of the Vice 
President, who may initiate investigation through the PSPB Publications Conduct 
Committee or other means and d etermine possible sanctions.  
Revisions to the above subsection, Principles of Ethical Publishing, require the 
review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance 
with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
Approval of and Changes  to the PSPB Operations Manual  
The first edition of this document was authored by a PSPB focus group chaired by 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   6 Pete Morley with Ken Dawson, Murray Eden, and Josephine Germano as members 
and approved by PSPB on 16 November 2001. The version approved by PSPB on 23 
June 2006 and by the IEEE Board of Directors on 11 August 2006 represented a 
major revision from previou s editions. This current version includes IEEE Board of 
Directors -approved amendments through February 2025 . Modifications to this 
document shall be approved by PSPB in accordance with Subsection 5.2.2 of this 
manual  and IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5). The PSPB Document Working Group responsible 
for the editorial effort  is chaired by Steve Yurkovich  with Michael Jensen , James 
Keller , and Gordon MacPherson  as members. The IEEE i ntends to continuously 
update the PSPB Operations Manual.  
Most  Recent Amendments  
Modifications to the previous edition of the PSPB Operations Manual ( which was 
dated 1 February  2025), approved by PSPB  and appropriately by the IEEE Board of 
Directors, focus in this revised edition on the following subsections:  
 
Subsections 2.1.1; 4.3.2; 4.3.4; 4.3.5; 4.3.7, and [new] subsection 4.4  
This language describes a restructuring of PSPB, focused on a new  grouping of the 
various Institute -wide publications into a single representative advisory structure: 
the PSPB Editoria l Advisory Group (PSPB EAG), from which three EAG members will 
be appointed as voting members of PSPB to represent the publications, in addition 
to any other voting members as specified in the current IEEE Bylaw s. 
 
Subsection 3.3.2 and [new] subsection 4.1.6 : New PSPB Standing Committee  
These changes reflect the creation of a new PSPB Standing Committee entitled 
PSPB Awards and Recognition Committee (PSPB -ARC).

 1.3 Objectives  
Publications play a major role in implementing the purposes of the IEEE as 
defined by its Constitution and in its vision and mission. Throughout the 
world, IEEE publications and information products serve to advance the 
theory and practice of electrical, e lectronics, communications,  and computer 
engineering, as well as computer science and the allied branches of 
engineering and the related arts and sciences and technologies, and their 
applications for the benefit of IEEE members worldwide and for the genera l 
public.  
To carry out these responsibilities, the IEEE shall:  
A. Provide archival publications of lasting value to the profession. Archival 
publications contain material that has been appropriately evaluated 
and published for preservation as a record of the field.  
B. Ensure that the material published by the IEEE is readily accessible 
and retrievable and that the needs of libraries and other important 
information services are met.  
C.  Present, in appropriate publications, information on matters of 
professional and social concern to the membership.  
D. Enhance communication between the Institute and its members, 
among its members, and with the public on matters of mutual interest 
and concern.  
E. Develop and use new media and processes for information 
dissemination and exchange.  
F. Develop and implement new products and services that enhance 
IEEE’s ability to provide information to members and the public.  
G. Optimize the use of the technical and financial resources of the 
Institute and its members in support of information dissemination 
activities.  
H. Ensure the widest possible dissemination of IEEE material consistent 
with maintaining the economic viability of IEEE’s publication 
operations.  
To help attain these objectives, PSPB shall propose for adoption by the IEEE 
Board of Directors policies, criteria and procedures governing all IEEE 
publications and related products and services.  
Revisions to the PSPB Objectives, as contained in this manual, require the 
review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in 
accord ance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5)

IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   24  
IEEE members and non -members, carry out a very wide range of duties and 
responsibilities on behalf of IEEE and are required to familiarize themselves 
with IEEE policies, procedures, practices and expectations for conduct and 
professionalism.  
2.7.1 Abiding by the IEEE Code of Ethics and Conduct as a n Officer 
or a Member of an IEEE Board or Committee  
The conduct of all IEEE members and non -members should reflect the 
highest level of ethics and professionalism. The behavior of all those 
engaging in activities on behalf of the IEEE should reflect the best interests of 
the Institute and its members. Each year, all IEEE members, through the 
membership renewal process, affirm their intention to abide by the IEEE 
Code of Ethics. Nonmembers who are involved in IEEE activities are also 
obligated to abide by the IEEE Code of Ethics. Such obligation is 
communicat ed through the governing procedures for the relevant IEEE 
activity. For the purpose of this policy , “non-member” relates to those non -
members of IEEE who are involved in IEEE activities and includes IEEE staff.  
A. OVERALL CONDUCT AND PROFESSIONALISM  
Members and non -members are expected to treat each other with 
respect, consideration and civility.  
Members or non -members engaging in activities which are contrary to 
or in violation of the IEEE Code of Ethics, IEEE Code of Conduct, IEEE 
governing documents, IEEE Operations Manuals and other internal and 
external rules and regulations that affect the me mbership and 
activities of IEEE may be subject to discipline, up to and including 
expulsion from participation in IEEE activities and/or IEEE 
membership.  
B. CONDUCT AS AN OFFICER OR A MEMBER OF AN IEEE BOARD OR 
COMMITTEE DURING MEETINGS  
Volunteers are expected to contribute to IEEE activities in a co -
operative and constructive manner, to ensure that the best possible 
use is made of the time available, given that volunteers are usually 
able to offer IEEE their time and effort very sparingl y. Meetings should 
be strongly focused on the business laid out in the agreed agenda, and 
not be impeded by irrelevant interventions. The Chair has the prime 
responsibility for the conduct of the meeting, but the co -operation of 
all members present is also  an important factor in ensuring that the 
business is conducted in a fair and harmonious manner.  
C. IEEE PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS  
All members or non -members who believe they have been subjected 
to any behavior by any member or non-member that violates the 
policies and procedures mentioned in Subsection 2.6.1.A should bring 
the matter to the attention of IEEE through the process described in 
IEEE Policy 7.10. Prompt reporting allows IEEE to review, assess, and 
take any necessary actions to address the complaint immediately.  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   25 Information on IEEE Policy 7.10 and the IEEE Ethics Reporting Line can 
be found at: https://www.ieee.org/about/ethics/complaint -
procedures.html . 
2.7.2 Conflict of Interest  
 
 
(extracted f rom) IEEE Policies, Section  9.9 – Conflict Of Interest  
 
Members, volunteers, and staff must act at all times in the best interests of IEEE when 
engaging in activities related to or on behalf of IEEE. Conflicts of interest, whether actual, 
perceived, or potential, must be avoided.  
 
A.  Definitions.  
 
 1. A conflict of interest is defined as any situation, transaction, or relationship in which 
a member’s, volunteer’s , or staff person’s decisions, actions, or votes could 
materially affect that individual’s professional, personal, financial, or business 
concerns.  
 
 2. A potential conflict of interest arises from a situation where an individual might have 
a conflict of interest based on his or her responsibility to IEEE.  
 
 3. A perceived conflict of interest arises where a third party might reasonably conclude 
that an individual’s private interests could improperly influence the performance of 
his or her responsibility to IEEE.  
 
B. Responsibility.   
 
 When conducting IEEE business or engaging in activities related to IEEE, members,  
volunteers and staff must be cognizant of any actual, perceived, or potential conflict of 
interest, especially those involving improper personal or financial gain. Consistent with 
the process outlined in §715 of the New York Not -for-Profit Corporation Law, it is the 
responsibility of all IEEE members  and volunteers  in any elected, appointed, or other 
decision -making position of an IEEE activity to consider each item of business where they 
have a vote or decision -making authority to determine if an actual, perceived, or 
potential conflict of interest may exist.  
 
 Any member or volunteer with a conflict of interest shall recuse himself or herself per 
Bylaw I -300.2 and shall not improperly influence the deliberations or vote on the matter 
giving rise to such conflict. For purposes of this Policy, improperly influence  means 
coercing, manipulating, misleading, or fraudulently influencing the decision or 
deliberation when the person knows or should have known that the action, if successful, 
could result in the outcome which the person could not deliberate or vote on dire ctly. 
 
A common misunderstanding about “conflict of interest” is that it only applies 
where an individual attempts to obtain some monetary advantage by virtue 
of being an office holder. A broader view of the concept applies to any 
situation where some kind of advantage or privilege is being sought through 
the exercise of authority granted to an office holder. The guiding principle for 
Volunteers is to follow IEEE Polices, Procedures, and Pr actices, and be seen 
by their peers to be acting ethically in their decision -making.   
2.7.3 Acceptance of Position Obligations  
Election or appointment of a Volunteer to a position, such as a Board or 
Committee chair or member, Editor -in-Chief, Reviewer, etc., implies that 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   26 there is an expectation that that person will be willing and able to undertake 
assigned duties and, if appropriate, to attend the meetings of the Board or 
Committee. Accepting a Board or Committee position also requires that the 
Volunteer is adequately pre pared for the meetings, that agenda articles  are 
read beforehand, and any items from the previous meeting requiring action 
are properly followed up. If a person is unable to perform these or other 
assigned duties, the expected result is a resignation from the position.   
2.7.4 Transfer of Position  
An orderly and regular turnover of Board or Committee membership, 
including that of the officers or editors, should be a routine feature of IEEE 
volunteerism. It ensures a healthy flow of new blood and invigorates all IEEE 
organizational units. Sections of  this document define the terms of office for 
PSPB Volunteers and the procedures for their election or appointment. It is  
the responsibility of the PSPB Chair and the PSPB Operating Committee to 
ensure that these practices are followed. It is a duty of al l PSPB Officers, 
PSPB Committee Chairs, and IEEE editors, to transfer all documents and 
other resources necessary for their successors to  carry out their work 
effectively.
2.7.5 Legal Aspects  
In the event that a legal issue arises, close adherence to the IEEE Code of 
Ethics, as well as IEEE Bylaws, Policies, Procedures, and Practices, provides a 
measure of protection to both IEEE and to individual members.  
The IEEE Code of Ethics cannot, and does not, attempt to define in a 
comprehensive manner how IEEE Volunteers should conduct themselves in 
their service on behalf of the IEEE, but it provides a sound basis on which 
high ethical standards can be established . 
2.8 Removal of a Member of PSPB or a PSPB Committee  
IEEE Bylaw I-111. Removal or Suspension of Delegates, Directors, and Officers  
 
7. Vote to Remove a Member of an IEEE Board or Committee or a Member of a 
Board or Committee of an Organizational Unit . A member of an IEEE  Board or 
Committee may be removed as a member of that Board or Committee, with or without 
cause, by the affirmative vote of two -thirds of the members of the appointing body 
present at the time of the vote, provided a quorum is present. A member of a board or 
committee of an organizational unit may be removed as a member of that board or 
committee, with or without cause, by either, as applicable, (i) the affirmative vote of 
two-thirds of the members of the appointing body, present at the time of the vote, 
provided a quorum is present, or (ii) the individual then currently holding the office that 
made the appointment.  
 Vacancies resulting from removal or suspension shall be filled following the 
methodology used to make the original appointment.

5.4 Agenda and Minutes of Meetings  
5.4.1  Meeting Agendas  
The preparation of a PSPB Agenda is a multi -step process. A “Call for Agenda 
Items” is sent to all members of PSPB, including all PSPB Committee Chairs 
and liaison representatives, approximately seven weeks before the meeting 
to solicit action/ discussion/  information items. Within the “Call for Agenda 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   66 Items” will be a deadline for submitting material, which is approximately two 
weeks later. The Agenda and attachments are made available to PSPB via e -
mail or posted on the IEEE website.  
The Agenda will contain action items with the relevant background material 
to allow PSPB members to be informed about the issue at hand. All action 
items shall include a statement of the financial impact the action might have 
on the PSPB Budget. Reports of  each of the PSPB Committees, PSPB Liaison 
representatives, the PSPB Chair and PSPB Secretary will be included in the 
Agenda.  
After the Agenda has been set for each PSPB meeting, the Managing 
Director, IEEE Publications  shall consult with the PSPB Chair concerning the 
appropriate staff to invite to the meeting. The staff selected will depend on 
the anticipated needs of the items on the agenda.  
If an individual (not directly associated with PSPB) wishes to present an 
information item to PSPB, a written report must be included with the Agenda. 
The individual must obtain permission from the PSPB Chair,  in order to have 
an item placed on the PSPB Agenda. These individuals are urged to work 
through the PSPB Vice Chair or the appropriate PSPB Committee.  
5.4.2  Meeting Minutes  
At all PSPB meetings, an IEEE Publications department staff member should 
be present to record the minutes of the meeting. If no IEEE Publications 
department staff member is available, the PSPB Chair shall appoint an 
appropriate person to record the minute s. The minutes need not be 
verbatim, but a summary of the actions with a reasonable amount of detail 
to insure the intent of the action taken will be understood by those who have 
not attended the meeting. Appendices containing all materials handed out 
during the PSPB Meeting but not included in the Agenda book/diskette shall 
accompany the minutes. A list of attendees shall be included in the 
appendices. Copies of minutes shall be distributed to all PSPB members 
within a reasonable amount of time after the c lose of each meeting.  
PSPB Committees shall produce a meeting summary, which contains an 
attendance list and reports on all actions taken during the meeting. 
Appendices containing material distributed at or before the Committee

SECTION 6 - PSPB FINANCIAL MATTERS  
 
6.1 PSPB Annual Budgeting Process  
The IEEE Publications department and PSPB shall adhere to the IEEE annual 
budgeting procedures and guidelines documented in the IEEE Finance 
Operations Manual (FOM).  
6.1.1  Budget Cycle  
The IEEE annual budget development process and timelines are established 
annually by the IEEE Finance Committee and disseminated to IEEE staff. 
Budget reviews are conducted throughout the year and the overall budget is 
reviewed at the June and September IE EE Finance Committee meetings. The 
Budget is then presented for approval to the IEEE Board of Directors at its 
last scheduled meeting for the year (normally in November).  
6.1.2  Financial Guidelines for Service -Oriented Cost Centers  
Service -oriented cost centers shall budget to break even or achieve a small 
surplus, i.e., less than USD100,000. A surplus is defined as a positive 
variance from a zero budget. Service -oriented cost centers include but are 
not limited to Transactions, Inde xing, Magazines/Newsletter s, Authoring 
Tools and Peer Review.  If a service -oriented cost center generates a surplus 
greater than USD100,000, then the following process shall be used for 
determining if a rate reduction or rebate is warranted:  
A. The net surplus of all service -oriented cost center budgets may not be 
used to offset deficits in other IEEE Publications department cost 
centers.  
B. Budgets for service -oriented cost centers should be developed close to 
breakeven, but potential budgets shall not contain a surplus exceeding 
2% of total expense or greater than USD100,000 per cost center.  
C. All positive variances to budget should be distributed, in the form of a 
rebate, to IEEE Publications department customers, who utilize IEEE 
internal service(s). Reviews for potential rebates, related to a budget 
year, will be performed three times:  
1. In July during the budget year, where the rebate will be issued 
in August of that budget year;  
2. In October during the budget year, where the rebate will be 
issued in December of that budget year; and  
3. At budget year end, where the rebate will be processed during 
the FM13 year end close.  
D. If Society/Council customers fail to meet their budgeted service levels 
(i.e., page counts or article counts) that result in a negative variance 
to the service -oriented cost center, the IEEE Technical Activities Board 
shall fund the negative variance.
 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)  74 
 
 
 Revisions to Subsection  6.1.2 – Financial Guidelines for Service Oriented Cost 
Centers, as contained in this manual, require the review and approval of the 
IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -
300.4(5).  
6.2 Administration of PSPB Finances  
The IEEE Publications department shall be responsible for the overall 
management of IEEE Publications department and PSPB finances, which 
include the coordination of the annual budget cycle, management of actuals 
against budget, and preparation of year -end forecasts versus budget. In 
addition, the IEEE Publications department supports the PSPB Treasurer and 
the activities of the PSPB Finance Committee.  
6.3 Publication Administration Charge  
Publication sponsoring organizational units shall pay their appropriate share 
of the Publications Administration Charge. These charges are to recover the 
costs of providing services including, but not limited to: providing mailing 
lists, postal permits, mi crofiching, copyrighting of materials, permissions 
requests, PSPB support, library services, and archiving.  
Revisions to Subsection  6.3 – Publication Administration Charge, as contained in 
this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using 
the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
6.4 Publication Rates  
The IEEE Publications department is responsible for establishing and 
enforcing numerous service rates annually. They include, but are not limited 
to: 
• Transactions/Journals/Letters  
• Magazines  
• IEEE Media  
• Newsletters  
• Publications produced outside the IEEE  
• ScholarOne Manuscripts  
• Indexing  
• Publications Administration (see Subsection  6.3) 
• Voluntary page charges and overlength -article  charges (see 
Subsection s 6.5.1 and 6.5.2, respectively)  
• IEEE Xplore  
• Conference Publishing.  
All rates are developed annually in conjunction with the IEEE annual budget 
development process and reviewed by the PSPB Operating Committee and 
PSPB during their first two  meetings in the calendar year.  More detailed 
information, including specific rates and service descriptions, is provided i n 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   75 the IEEE Approved Publication  Rates Manual.
6.5 Article  Processing Charges  
6.5.1  General Principles  
IEEE and IEEE organizational units are authorized to adopt Article Processing 
Charges (APCs) under the following principles.  
A. Article Processing Charges  are necessary to help keep IEEE publishing 
program self -sustaining.  
B. Article Processing Charges  are of two types, mandatory and voluntary. 
Examples of APCs include, but are not restricted to, voluntary page 
charges, overlength article charges, mandatory open access publishing 
charges, and mandatory charges for article modification.  
1. A voluntary page charge by a publication is at the option of the 
publication and its sponsoring organizational unit to help cover 
the cost of publication.  
2. An overlength article charge is a mechanism for accommodating 
the maximum number of authors’ articles within a given 
publication by requiring authors to pay a charge for each page 
that exceeds a specified limit.  
3. Open access processing charges help defray the cost of 
publishing an article and maintaining it on IEEE’s digital library 
for free access by readers. An organizational unit may require 
payment of the APC after article acceptance and before the 
article i s published.  
4. The changes for some requested article modifications may result 
in significant costs. When a request does not meet the 
requirements of Subsection  8.1.10, IEEE may levy an 
appropriate charge.  
5. In addition, the sponsoring organizational unit of an IEEE 
publication is authorized to charge authors, at cost, extra 
expenses incurred when meeting acceptable author specified 
requirements not regularly supplied to authors.  
 
C. Article Processing Charges , including an author’s request for a waiver , 
shall not influence the editorial decision process of the publication . 
6.5.2  Conditions for Establishing Article Processing Charges  
IEEE and IEEE organizational units are authorized to adopt Article Processing 
Charges (APCs) under the following conditions:  
A. Article Processing Charges may be established by the sponsoring unit 
for any authorized IEEE publication type, subject to approval by PSPB 
and the TAB/PSPB Products and Services Committee. Authorized 
publication types are named in Subsection  1.5 - Oversight 
Responsibilities for Publications . 
B. Article Processing Charges and the rules for processing them shall be 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   76 clearly stated in the Guidelines for Authors for that publication. 
Modification of charges and rules may occur at any time following the 
approval by PSPB and the TAB/PSPB Products and Services Committee 
as specified in item 6.5.2.A and following posting of a 90 -day notice in 
the Guidelines for Authors.  
C. Organizational units shall establish a process for authors to apply for a 
waiver of Mandatory APCs in cases of financial hardship.  
D. IEEE or its organizational units may offer discounts on Mandatory 
APCs. However, IEEE reserves the right to set an IEEE -wide discount in 
order to reduce confusion among authors. Such discounts shall be 
publicized and made available to all authors under similar terms and 
conditions. Examples are member discounts or discounts to authors 
affiliated with an organization that has established a master account 
for paying APCs.  
E. Non-payment of an APC by an author shall not be considered an 
automatic application for waiver. If an author has not paid a 
Mandatory APC after a reasonable amount of time, this non -payment 
of the charges may be reported to the appropriate credit monitorin g 
agencies. PSPB or the organizational unit sponsoring the publication 
may establish the length of time that must occur before this action is 
taken, and this information shall be included in the related instructions 
to authors.  
F. Authors who do not p ay Mandatory APCs without a waiv er shall be 
barred from submitting future articles to IEEE publications until such 
time as their previous outstanding charges are paid.  
G. If a third party (such as the author’s institution or research sponsor) is 
responsible for paying the Mandatory APCs, it is the author's 
responsibility to (1) inform IEEE of this arrangement and (2) ensure 
that the fees are paid.  
(See also Subsection .1.10 – Correcting Metadata in IEEE Xplore.)  
Revisions to Subsection  6.5 – Article Processing  Charges , as contained in this 
manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the 
process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
6.6 IEEE PRESS Business and Financial Arrangements

SECTION 8 - PSPB PROCEDURAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISIONS  
 
8.1 Publication Policies  
IEEE Policies, Section  6.1– Authority For IEEE Publication Products and Services  
IEEE publications exist by Board of Directors directive or as Publication Services and 
Products Board initiatives with Board of Directors approval.  
The Board of Directors shall specify those publications to be received by every IEEE 
member. Such publications are the direct responsibility of the Publication Services and 
Products Board. Policies and procedures applying to these publications shall be spe cified in 
the Publications Services and Products Board Operations Manual.  
All published products and services, in any form that originates from an IEEE organizational 
unit or bear the IEEE Master Brand, are ultimately the responsibility of the IEEE Publication 
Services and Products Board. These published products and services sh all conform to the 
policies and procedures that shall be specified in the IEEE Publications Services and Products 
Board Operations Manual.  
The major organizational units may introduce new publications following the approval 
policies and procedures which shall be specified in the Publications Services and Products 
Board Operations Manual.  
Organizational units may specify additional policies and procedures which shall conform to 
and do not conflict with these policies.  
8.1.1  General  
All persons involved with any aspect of IEEE publications should be cognizant 
of the general policies that govern all IEEE publications and, particularly, to 
those that relate to their areas of responsibility.  
A. The IEEE is a transnational organization. Special care should therefore 
be taken in using the word “national” in connection with IEEE 
activities. For example , references to a national Headquarters, a 
national President, or a national Society President, are all potentially 
inappropriate.  
B. Statements and opinions given in work published by the IEEE are the 
expression of the authors. Responsibility for the content of published 
articles  rests upon the authors, not the IEEE.  
C. No letter or article received unsigned shall be published. It is 
acceptable for letters or articles to carry the notation “Name withheld 
on request.”  
D. No letter or article shall be published if it contains any pejorative ad -
hominem remarks or any other material deemed inappropriate or 
offensive.  
E. Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or 
animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall 
include a statement in the article that the research was performed 
under the oversight of an institutional review board or  equivalent 
local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   80 committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not 
conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also 
report that consent from the human subjects in the research was 
obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.  
F. Material  of a nontechnical nature should conform with Subsection 
8.1.3, Presentation of Nontechnical Material.  
G. Material involving the support or nonsupport of candidates for public 
office is not permitted.  
H. Unduly commercial material should also be avoided. For example,  
“company profiles” and/or “industrial biographies” merit careful 
attention.  
I. The language used in all IEEE Journals, Transactions, and Letters, as 
well as the proceedings of any IEEE conference designated as an 
international conference, shall be English. English style guidelines are 
specified in the IEEE Editorial Style Manual . The IEEE Editorial Style 
Manual  contains references that should be consulted for guidance on 
spelling, grammar and usage.  
All other IEEE publications should normally be produced in English, and 
the IEEE Editorial Style Manual  shall be consulted for guidance on 
spelling, grammar, and usage. However, if Editors -in-Chief or 
Conference Organizers choose to accept submissions in languages 
other than English, titles and abstracts for those submissions shall be 
provided in English using the recommended style guidelines specified 
by the IEEE Editorial Style Manual . 
J. IEEE defines the “date of publication” as the date that content was first 
made publicly available.  
1. For IEEE periodicals, the date of publication will be cited as the 
date an article was made available to the public, either online 
through IEEE’s content delivery platform, IEEE Xplore, or in 
print, whichever comes first. For example, IEEE journal artic les 
may be published online prior to final copy editing of the 
content, assignment of that content to an issue, or final 
pagination of the content. The definition of publication, in this 
case, shall be the date that the article was first posted to IEEE 
Xplore, either as a pre -print (accepted as result of peer review, 
but not copyedited) or as a rapid post article (accepted as a 
result of peer review and copyedited, except for pagination).  
Consistent with Subsection  8.2.5, IEEE journals, transactions, 
and letters shall display the following series of dates in the first 
footnote of the article: article  received, article  revised. By 1 
January 2011, articles in IEEE journals, transactions, and letters 
shall also include the foll owing dates into the footnotes:  date of 
article  acceptance, date of publication, date of current version.  
2. The date of publication for an IEEE Standard shall be the same 
date that the first version of the document with a specific 
revision or edition year is transmitted to IEEE Standards Online 
and IEEE Xplore. Approved IEEE Standards shall be clearly 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   81 distinguished from published drafts, so drafts shall not be 
considered first publications. Drafts shall be distinguished by a 
date assigned by a volunteer editor.  
3. For all other types of IEEE publications, the date of publication 
shall be cited as the date that each publication was made 
available to the public, whether distributed online through 
IEEE’s content delivery platform, IEEE Xplore, in print, or on CD -
ROM/DVD, whichever comes first.  
 
4. All IEEE publications shall include the date of publication, unless 
the sponsoring organizational unit has requested and received 
an exception from the Vice President – Publication Services and 
Products.  
(See also the IEEE -SA Standards Board Operations Manual Section 5 - 
Standards Development and Section 8 - Publication.)  
K. Units of Measure in IEEE Publications.  
 
IEEE Policies, Section  9.16 – Metric Policy  
All IEEE Organizational Units shall:  
A. Actively support the use of the International System of Units (Le Système International 
d'Unités, or SI), the modernized metric system.  
B. Follow SI -based metric practice as detailed in IEEE/ASTM SI 10, Standard for Use of the 
International System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System, to express measured and 
calculated values of quantity in all IEEE publications, including standards.  
C. Promote the understanding and use of SI in education at all levels, both within the 
profession and in society at large.  
Necessary exceptions to this policy, such as where a conflicting world industry practice 
exists, must be evaluated on an individual basis and approved by the responsible Major 
Board of the IEEE for a specific period of time.  
The International System of Units (SI units) shall be used in IEEE 
publications. An exception to this requirement is non -SI units that are 
based on international industry practice. Some examples of acceptable 
non-SI units include the bel, plane angle degree, and electronvolt. 
Equivalent customary units of measurement may be included but shall 
follow the SI units in parenthesis. The  IEEE Transactions, Journal, and 
Letters Information for Authors  guide should be consulted for preferred 
usage  of units and conversion factors.  
(See also IEEE/ASTM SI 10, Standard for Use of the International 
System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System.)  
Revisions to Subsection  8.1.1 – General, as contained in this manual, require 
the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in 
accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.1.2  IEEE Organizational Unit Publications  
IEEE Policies, Section  6.6 – IEEE Organizational Unit Publications  
Any IEEE organizational unit may issue a local publication. The publication’s objective shall 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   82 be consonant with the objectives of the IEEE.  
Organizational Units shall inform the IEEE Publications Services and Products Board of such 
publication and provide copies as published to the appropriate member of the IEEE staff as 
designated by the Executive Director.  
Any IEEE organizational unit may issue a local publication and shall inform 
the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board accordingly, and shall 
provide copies to the Secretary of the Publication Services and Products 
Board, as published. Advertising is  permitted (see Subsection  8.1.8). The 
objective of the publication shall be consonant with the objectives of the 
IEEE. 
8.1.3  Nontechnical  Material  
The discussion of technical matters will continue to be the primary function of 
the forum provided by IEEE. To enable the presentation of nontechnical 
material in a manner appropriate to the needs of the membership, and 
recognizing that the IEEE membership  is very diverse , the following 
guidelines are to be implemented by the PSPB and followed by editors and 
meeting organizers . This subsection  applies to  reviewed  articles of all IEEE 
publications,  and serves as guidelines for relevant  decisions made  by the 
person  responsible  for the publication . 
A. ALLOWABLE CONTENT  
1. Technical  articles accepted  for inclusion  in IEEE publications 
shall be comprised of  scientific or  technical  content  that is 
observable and  falsifiable.  
2. Any nontechnical  content or material  in an article accepted  for 
publication  is expected  to be essential  to the technical  content  of 
that article (for  example, content  that extends,  supports,  or 
provides  background).  Author(s) shall  state how  the 
nontechnical  content  or material contributes to the article.  The 
person  responsible for  the publication  shall determine  if the 
author’s explanation  is acceptable.  
3. Nontechnical  content to acknowledge contributors,  who are not  
authors of  the article, such  as in a footnote or  an 
acknowledgments  section,  shall be limited  to statements 
relative to funding  sources,  as well as technical  or material 
contributions from  individuals or  organizations.  Nontechnical  
content  to acknowledge  technical  or material  contributions 
(such  as construction of  a laboratory  apparatus)  should include 
a brief explanation of how  such contributions are  essential  to 
the technical  content of  the article.  
4. It should  be made evident  to the audience that  any opinions 
expressed  (within  these guidelines) are those of  the author,  and 
no endorsement  by IEEE, its  officials,  or its members is implied.  
B. SOCIETAL IMPACT  
 Technical  developments  can have a  profound impact on society  and 
social conditions shaping  the course of  technical  developments.  It is 
therefore  appropriate that  discussions of  the social, as well  as the 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   83 purely technical aspects,  of the author’s  work be included , according to 
the following guidelines.  
1. The subject matter should be relevant to the IEEE fields of 
interest and their impact on society. If the relevance or  
appropriateness is not self -evident from the author’s 
presentation, it should be made clear by the addition of a 
suitable introductory statement. The discussion of pertinent 
interrelated social, economic and technical aspects may lead to 
political conclusi ons on the part of the author. Since political 
conclusions ordinarily have particular relevance to a specific 
national environment, suc h limitations of the author’s or 
speaker’s conclusions should be made clear if they are not self -
evident.  
2. Reasonable efforts should be made to provide for adequate and 
timely presentations of differing viewpoints. This may be 
accomplished either by planned simultaneous presentations or 
by presentation of one side of an issue, clearly identified as 
such, with provision for prompt, subsequent presentation of 
representative audience discussion and rebuttal.  
(See also Subsection  8.2.2 – The Review Process)  
Revisions to Subsection  8.1.3 –Nontechnical Material, as contained in this 
manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.1.4  IEEE Copyright Policy and Procedures  
IEEE Policies, Section  6.3.1 - IEEE COPYRIGHT POLICIES  
A. General Policies . In order to maximize the value of IEEE publications to authors, users 
and the IEEE, the following IEEE copyright policies shall be applied throughout the IEEE:  
 1) IEEE shall serve and protect the interests of its authors and their employers.  
 2) All technical, educational and professional publications of the IEEE, except 
newsletters, but including Society and Technical Council Newsletters, are required to 
be copyrighted by the IEEE.  
 3) Copyright shall be held by the IEEE and not any of its organizational units.  
 4) The Intellectual Property Rights Office is responsible for the administration of all 
IEEE copyright matters under these policies and the procedures which shall be 
specified in the PSPB Operations Manual. This includes obtaining the copyright 
registrati on, handling reprint and republication requests, maintaining copyright 
records, and administering fees when appropriate. The Intellectual Property Rights 
Office may, at its discretion, delegate some or all of its copyright implementation 
responsibilities t o other IEEE departments if they have significant publishing activity, 
subject to procedures approved by a member of the IEEE staff, as designated by the 
Executive Director.  
 5) Third-Party Rights to Reuse IEEE -Copyrighted Material. Licenses and permissions to 
use IEEE copyrighted material (abstracts, full text, etc.) for commercial or other 
non-IEEE related purposes may be granted under terms approved by the IEEE 
Publication Services and Products Board.  
 6) Fees for the reuse of IEEE material are appropriate for contributing to the cost of 
original publication, especially where the reuse involves the republication of 
material, or any commercial uses.  
 7) Prior to publication by the IEEE, all authors or their employers shall transfer to the 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   84 IEEE in writing any copyright they hold for their individual papers . Such transfer 
shall be a necessary requirement for publication, except for material in the public 
domain or which is reprinted with permission from a copyrighted publication.  
 8) In return for the transfer of authors’ rights, the IEEE shall grant authors and their 
employers’ permission to make copies and otherwise reuse the material under terms 
approved by the Board of Directors which shall be specified in the PSPB Operations 
Manual.  
 9) After IEEE accepts the work for publication and the copyright has been transferred, 
changes or revisions to the work shall not be made without further review and 
approval.  
 10) For jointly sponsored conferences, which might require special copyright 
arrangements, those arrangements shall be made in accordance with the procedures 
which shall be specified in the PSPB Operations Manual.  
 11) Copyrighting Electronic Information shall follow the electronic information 
dissemination procedures, which shall be specified in the PSPB Operations Manual.  
 12) The PSPB or its authorized designee shall consider the allowance of any exceptions 
to these Copyright policies . 
Procedures with regard to IEEE copyright policies are specified in this 
subsection, including A. General Principles of the policies and procedures, B. 
Ownership and Rights of IEEE copyrighted material, and Implementation of 
IEEE policy . 
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF IEEE COPYRIGHT POLICIES AND 
PROCEDURES  
1. Enhancing the accessibility, distribution and use of information 
is a major objective of the IEEE publication program, limited 
only by the requirements of viability and professional propriety.  
2. To meet this objective and control the use of its good name, the 
IEEE is obligated to secure copyright ownership of the material 
it publishes.  
3. In exercising its rights under copyright, the IEEE recognizes that 
it is acting in part to serve and protect the interests of its 
authors and their employers.  
4. Fees for the reuse of IEEE material are appropriate for 
contributing to the cost of original publication, especially where 
the reuse involves a license to copy, or allows resale, or is of a 
magnitude that would tend to reduce subscription or other sales  
income.  
5. Copyright policies shall be consistently applied throughout IEEE . 
B. OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS  OF IEEE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL  
1. Copyright is held by IEEE itself and not any of its organizational 
units.  
2. All technical, educational and professional publications of the 
IEEE, except newsletters, but including Society and Technical 
Council Newsletters and e -Newsletters, are required to be 
copyrighted by the IEEE.  
3. Prior to publication by the IEEE, all authors or their  employers 
shall transfer to the IEEE in writing any copyright they  hold for 
their individual articles. Such transfer shall be a  necessary 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   85 requirement for publication, except for material in the  public 
domain, material which is reused from a copyrighted  
publication, or articles published Open Access. Open Access 
articles  shall be published under the appropriate license.   
4. In return for the transfer of authors’ copyrights , the IEEE shall 
grant authors and their employer’s permission to make copies 
and otherwise reuse the accepted versions of their articles  under 
terms approved by the Board of Director s. 
5. In the case of jointly sponsored conferences, IEEE  recognizes 
the right of another qualified sponsor to hold the copyright and 
administer all copyright matters on behalf of the IEEE and its 
author, provided, however, that such right shall be the subject 
of a written agreement between IEEE and the qualified sponsor.  
A conference is not considered a sponsor and may not hold a 
copyright to IEEE material, except in the case of a conference 
which is incorporated and maintains its own permanent 
administrative office.  
6. Licenses and permissions to copy or republish IEEE material 
may be granted under terms approved by PSPB.  
C. IMPLEMENTATION OF IEEE COPYRIGHT POLICY  
1. The Editor -in-Chief or conference publication committee chair 
shall be responsible for obtaining the written transfer of author 
rights and for forwarding appropriate confirmations to the 
Publishing Ethics & Conduct Office . A form for effecting the 
interchange of rights with the author per Subsection s 8.1.4.B.3 
and 8.1.4.B.4 shall be supplied by PSPB or its authorized 
representative. The wording used on the form shall be approved 
by PSPB or its authorized representative.  
2. For journals and conference publications, an appropriate 
copyright notice shall appear on the fir st page or in close 
proximity to the article abstract of each  technical contribution.  
3. Should the need for isolated exceptions to any of the above 
policies and procedures arise, PSPB or its authorized 
representative is authorized to deal with them on a case -by-
case basis.  
8.1.5  Guidelines  for Use of IEEE Logo and “IEEE”  
IEEE Policies, Section  6.3.2 - Guidelines for Use of IEEE Logo and “IEEE”  
The following are guidelines on the use of the IEEE logo, i.e., the diamond -shaped emblem 
which is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as the trademark of the IEEE, 
and on the use of “IEEE,” the recognized abbreviation of The Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, Inc.  
A. The IEEE logo should be used on IEEE’s wholly owned publications and also on meeting 
notices, programs and other promotional literature and products. On any of these, the 
logo should be displayed prominently at least once accompanied by the registration  
mark, i.e., the R in a circle (  ® ) shown at the lower right of the emblem. On 
publications, it is recommended that the logo appear on the front cover and title page, if 
any. 
B. When used with a logo of an organizational unit within IEEE, the IEEE logo should be at 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   86 least the same size as the other logo, preferably larger or in a more prominent position. 
In publications produced in cooperation with groups outside the IEEE all logos should be 
the same size. (It may be acceptable to use logos in different sizes to refle ct unequal 
participation.)  
C. In every use, the integrity of the logo must be preserved. For example:  
 (1) Only the complete, official logo in either solid or outline form may be used. (Hand 
drawn or deformed versions are not permitted.)  
 (2) Neither the whole nor recognizable parts may be incorporated into another logo 
whether designed by an IEEE organizational unit or not.  
 (3) The logo may be printed in any color with another color as background, but should 
not be printed in several colors.  
 (4) The logo should not be obscured by any other design, lettering, etc.  
 (5) The logo should not be used frivolously.  
D. The logo shall be used only in connection with official business of the IEEE.  
8.1.6  Titling Protocols for IEEE Publication and Information 
Products  
To maintain excellence in publishing practices and to minimize the possibility 
of legal problems, IEEE volunteers and staff must assure, to the extent 
possible, that IEEE publication and information -product  titles are not 
knowingly selected, formatted or used in a way which might promote 
confusion with any other publication title or compromise the integrity of an 
IEEE title.  
Proposals for new journals and magazines  must include a statement that the 
proposers themselves are aware of the literature in the field and either 
perceive no potential title problems or have clearly identified (for further 
advice or examination) any points of potential conflict. For magazines , the 
proposal must also include evidence that a legal title search has been 
performed through the IEEE Legal and Compliance Department and shows no 
title conflicts. The expense of the legal title search shall be born e by the 
sponsoring organizational unit.  
The design and formatting of new (or changed) magazine titles, as used on 
covers and in promotional or advertising material , will be subject to review 
by appropriate Legal staff at the earliest possible opportunity prior to public 
use. 
This requirement must be observed by all periodicals and is of particular 
importance to magazines.  The spirit of the requirement is also applicable to 
other classes of IEEE publication and information products.  
The IEEE Legal and Compliance Department shall take all appropriate 
measures, including registering qualifying magazine titles through the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office, to protect its titles from infringement by 
others. The expense of title registration will be borne by the sponsoring 
organization al unit.  
(See also IEEE Policies, Subsection  6.3.2 – Guidelines on the Use of the IEEE 
Logo and “IEEE”. This policy is also stated under Subsection  8.1.5 for 
convenience.)  
(See also Subsection  8.4.5 for information on Conference Proceedings titles.)  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   87 Revisions to Subsection  8.1.6 – Titling Protocols for IEEE Publication and 
Information Products , as contained in this manual, require the review and 
approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with 
IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.1.7  Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE 
Periodicals
IEEE Policies, Section  6.4 - Multiple Publication of Original Technical Material in 
IEEE Periodicals  
IEEE’s technical publications shall include original material which appears only once in the 
archival literature. Unusual circumstances may allow for exceptions to this policy. The 
appropriate procedures to be followed shall be specified in the PSPB Operat ions Manual.  
Exceptions to IEEE Policies, Section  6.4 shall be restricted to the following.  
A. REPUBLICATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARTICLES  
The occasional republication of an individual article  from another IEEE 
(or non -IEEE) publication is permitted at the discretion of the Editor -
in-Chief, provided:  
1. Such republication happens in rare and exceptional cases and  
will significantly benefit the readers of the second publication.  
2. The author’s permission is sought and obtained by the Editor -in-
Chief. 
3. Permission is also cleared through the IEEE Permissions  Office  
or, in the case of a non -IEEE publication, the other publisher’s 
Permissions Department.  
4. The republished article shall include an appropriate 
copyright/credit notice indicating the original source.  
B. SPECIAL DISSEMINATION VIA “BONUS” ISSUE  
Collaborat ion between two or more IEEE or Society periodicals in 
jointly sponsoring a special issue on an interdisciplinary subject of 
mutual interest is permissible provided that the articles appear in only 
one periodical, hereafter identified as the Bonus Periodical.  
In such cases, the Bonus Periodical would be provided to the member 
and nonmember subscribers of the collaborating publication(s).  
Although no formal approval is required, the Editors -in-Chief involved 
must jointly notify the Vice President - Publication Services and 
Products (via the PSPB Secretary) of their intent to produce a Bonus 
Issue at least six months prior to the proposed publication date. The 
notification must clearly specify the agr eed upon arrangements for 
distribution and cost -sharing.  
C. JOINT PUBLICATION OF A WHOLE ISSUE  
Joint publication of an entire issue (or of a substantial section of an 
issue) is not encouraged, and requires the approval of a Multiple 
Publication Proposal by PSPB and the Board to which the sponsoring 
IEEE organizational unit reports. Approval must be obtained prior to 
the beginning of the annual IEEE budgeting cycle of the year preceding 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   88 the anticipated publication date.  
The Multiple Publication Proposal must include:  
1. Statistics about overlapping members and subscribers;  
2. A statement relative to the novelty of the topic; and  
3. A joint agreement signed by the Editor -in-Chief of each of the 
periodicals indicating which will be the “primary” and which the 
“secondary” or republished publication.  
D. JOINT PUBLICATION OF SPECIAL ISSUES WITH NON -IEEE 
PUBLICATIONS  
Joint publication of special issues between an IEEE periodical and a 
non-IEEE periodical is not encouraged and should be considered only 
in the spirit of the above requirements. The “Bonus” issue approach is 
recommended over the traditional joint issue. Ho wever, if a joint issue 
is finally agreed to be desirable, the IEEE Editor -in-Chief is required to 
follow the procedures of Subsection  8.1.7.C for approval of IEEE 
involvement. The IEEE Editor -in-Chief should strive to arrange that the 
IEEE publication be the “primary” publication. In this case additional 
information should be supplied concerning which publisher is 
responsible for editorial handling, composition, production, 
manufacturing, and distribution; which will hold copyright and handle 
republication  permissions; how expenses and income are to be 
handled, etc. Early consultation with Publications, Products, and 
Services is highly recommended.  
E. PUBLICATION IN IEEE PERIODICALS OF ARTICLES BASED UPON 
THESES AND DISSERTATIONS  
It is common in technical publishing for an author to base an article on 
work appearing in a thesis or dissertation written by that author. IEEE 
recognizes the importance of this publication paradigm and fully 
supports it, but IEEE requires that the thesis  or dissertation be fully 
referenced through direct citation of the thesis or dissertation or 
through other articles generated from and referencing the thesis or 
dissertation. Accordingly, the publication in an IEEE periodical based 
on original technical m aterial contained in a thesis or dissertation is 
considered appropriate  provided that the articles have undergone the 
standard peer review for the specific periodical in question.  
F. PUBLICATION OF ARTICLES  IN IEEE PERIODICALS BASED UPON 
CONFERENCE ARTICLES  
IEEE Policies, Section 6.4, specifies that IEEE’s technical publications 
shall include original material, which appears only once in the archival 
literature, and Subsection  1.3.A of this Manual presents a definition of 
an archival publication. Nevertheless, it is common in technical 
publishing for material to be presented at various stages of its 
evolution, such as publishing early ideas in a workshop  or as a draft 
article posted as a Preprint (see Subsection 8.1.9.A.2.d) , more 
developed work in a conferenc e, and fully developed contributions as 
journal or transactions articles. IEEE recognizes the importance of this 
evolutionary publication process as a significant means of scientific 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   89 communication and fully supports this publishing paradigm, but IEEE 
requires that this evolutionary process be fully referenced. 
Accordingly,  the publication in an IEEE periodical of original technical 
material contained in a conference article or articles is permitted 
provided that:  
1. All the articles have undergone the standard peer review for the 
specific periodical in question
2. With the exception of that specified in Subsection  8.1.7.A,  all 
the articles published in the periodical contain substantial 
additional technical material with respect to the conference 
article or articles of which they represent an evolution.  
3. Each article in the periodical satisfies the requirements of 
Subsection  8.2.4.G .2. 
4. If the organizational unit or units sponsoring the periodical 
desire to set a quantitative threshold for the additional technical 
material mentioned in 8.1.7. F.2, the requirements shall be 
clearly specified in the instructions for the authors of the 
periodical.  
(See also Subsection  8.2.4.G . “Guidelines for Editorial Reuse of Previously 
Published Material, and Adjudicating Inappropriate Reuse of Previous Work or 
the Failure to Inform Editors of Previous Publications or Multiple 
Submissions.”)  
Revisions to the Subsection  8.1.7. F – Publication of Articles  in IEEE 
Periodicals Based Upon Conference Articles, as contained in this manual, 
require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the 
process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.1.8  Advertising in IEEE Information Services and Products  
A. GENERAL  
Advertising is an important means of disseminating technological and 
scientific information to professionals working in IEEE fields of interest. 
It does this by presenting descriptions concerning the availability and 
capabilities of new or improved products and services to professionals.  
The acceptance of advertising in the information services and products 
of IEEE and its organizational units has a long tradition dating back 
well over half a century. Advertising has special value in that the 
revenue it generates helps subsidize the expens e of producing the 
information services and products and enables the further 
dissemination of technological and scientific information.  
It is, therefore, entirely fitting that the IEEE should permit the 
inclusion of advertising in information services and products where 
appropriate. These include, but are not limited to:  
• Magazines  
• Journals, Transactions, and Letters  
• Virtual Journals  
• Newsletters  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   90 • Newspapers  
• Other periodicals  
• Conference publications  
• Websites  
• Webcasts/Webinars  
• Online or e -learning courses  
• e-newsletters/alerts  
• Videocasts  
• Podcasts  
• Job Sites  
• Apps 
• Mobile Versions  
• Digital Editions.   
For the purposes of the following policy statements, “advertising” is 
defined as display advertising of a specific product or service. “Print 
advertising” is defined as ink on paper or the digital facsimile of print 
presented on digital devices, such as computers, tablets, or 
smartphones. “Electronic advertising” is defined as banner advertisi ng, 
whitepapers, sponsored content, sponsored webinars, sponsored 
webcasts, sponsored videocasts, sponsored blogs, and so forth 
appearing in the context of an IEEE branded website or on a mobile 
device.  
Excluded from these policy requirements are institutional listings or 
logos of sponsors, donors, or patrons, which are regarded by IEEE as 
acknowledgments of contributions supporting a particular activity, 
such as for a meeting or conference, rather than a dvertising of 
products or services.  
B. ACCEPTABLE ADVERTISING  
Requirements have been established to ensure that the benefits 
afforded by such advertising are achieved within the bounds of good 
taste and in a manner consistent with IEEE’s scientific and educational 
objectives. It is a further intent to provide a mecha nism for 
maintaining and monitoring balance among the sometimes conflicting 
or competing elements of a vigorous advertising program.  
All IEEE print and electronic services and products are subject to the 
following general advertising requirements.  
1. The advertising intent should be to serve “common interests” of 
the user/reader of the print or electronic product. It should 
contain technical content or be of informational usefulness to 
appropriate and fitting to the member demographic.  
2. The advertising shall be appropriate to the editorial context of 
the print or electronic product in which it appears and be 
consistent with what the IEEE brand represents. Advertisements 
shall also be clearly distinguishable from editorial content, and 
the appearance and usefulness of the information service or 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   91 product shall not be impaired by the advertising content.  
3. The Editor -in-Chief, other editors on the editorial board,  or the 
associated editorial staff shall not be influenced by advertiser or 
business staff pressure that would interfere with their 
prerogative to decide the position and merits of technical 
editorial content for print or electronic dissemination.  
4. The appearance of paid advertising in an IEEE product shall 
constitute neither a guarantee nor an endorsement by IEEE of 
the product, service, or company involved, or of the claims 
made for the product within the advertisement. The information 
service o r product shall include a disclaimer statement regarding 
any paid advertising.  
5. IEEE logos shall not appear on any advertisement without prior 
written approval by IEEE. The advertiser shall not refer to the 
fact that its ad has appeared in any IEEE information service or 
product in any collateral advertising.  
6. Authorization for a class of an IEEE information service or 
product to carry advertising shall not be granted if, in the 
judgment of PSPB with the concurrence of the IEEE Board of 
Directors, the inclusion of advertising would cause an overall 
reduction of the product’s value to the IEEE membership or to 
the IEEE institutional subscribers and end users, or would be 
otherwise detrimental to the IEEE brand.  
C. SALE OF ADVERTISING IN IEEE INFORMATION SERVICES AND  
PRODUCTS  
The IEEE Media department and IEEE organizational units can sell 
advertising in IEEE information services and products under their 
management or control when the inclusion of such advertising does 
not interfere with the Mission, Vision or Values of IEEE, or the 
development or implementation of IEEE’s Strategic Plan. The  decision 
to sell advertising space shall be made independently of editorial 
content.  
The IEEE Media department and IEEE organizational units retain sole 
discretion, subject to oversight by PSPB, when deciding to approve or 
deny advertisements in IEEE information services and products under 
their management or control. This includes, but is  not limited to, such 
factors as the advertisement’s size, format, appearance, placement, 
and the length of time the advertisement will appear, as well as the 
removal of any advertisement that has been previously approved.  
The sale of advertising in IEEE information services and products shall 
adhere to the following.  
1. When the sale of advertising in any information service and 
product that has more than Regional distribution requires the 
services of independent contractors (i.e., paid professional 
advertising sales representatives), either (a) the IEEE Media 
departme nt or (b) the staff or designated volunteer members of 
the responsible IEEE organizational unit shall handle all 
arrangements with these contractors in accordance with all 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   92 related IEEE policies. In cases where an organizational unit uses 
volunteers to handle this activity, all arrangements shall be 
coordinated with the sponsoring organizational unit’s 
administrative body.  
(See also the IEEE Finance Operations Manual.)  
2. If advertising is to be sold directly by the IEEE Media 
department or the staff of the responsible IEEE organizational 
unit, or through independent contractors managed by the IEEE 
Media department staff or the IEEE organizational unit staff, the 
followi ng shall apply:  
a. Sponsoring organizational unit participation in the sales 
effort will be fully coordinated with the involved IEEE 
staff. 
b. The advertising rates will be set by the involved IEEE 
staff, in consultation with the sponsoring organizational 
units concerned, subject to PSPB approval.  
3. If advertising is to be handled by volunteer members of a 
sponsoring organizational unit, the following shall apply:  
a. The sponsoring organizational unit will appoint one or 
more volunteer members to handle advertising sales, 
arrange for collections, coordinate advertising plans with 
IEEE staff, and see that publication requirements and 
schedules are met.  
b. The setting of advertising rates will be coordinated with 
the sponsoring organizational unit’s administrative body.  
c. No advertising shall be placed in an approved class of 
publication unless authorized by its sponsoring 
organizational unit.  
d. All advertising income will be credited to and expenses 
borne by the sponsoring organizational unit.  
(See also IEEE Policies, Section 13.3, Elections and Electioneering.)  
D. ADVERTISING IN REGION/SECTION PUBLICATIONS  
1. Advertising in Section publications is subject to the general IEEE 
requirements stated in this subsection and is permitted on the 
basis that it provides a worthwhile service to readers in a 
particular geographical area and to advertisers, and that the 
publication’s distribution and method of selling advertising is 
sufficiently localized so as to not no rmally interfere with the 
advertising programs of other IEEE publications having 
distribution in multiple Sections. However, Section publications 
containin g advertising may be distributed to the members of 
more than one Section only with the approval of the other 
Sections involved and the Member and Geographic Activities 
Board.  
2. An advertiser is free to buy advertising separately in two or 
more Section publications. However, two or more Section 
publications may sell advertising to the same advertiser at 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   93 combination rates only with the prior approval of the PSPB 
Chair.  
E. ADVERTISING IN TRANSACTIONS JOURNALS AND LETTERS  
Advertising is permitted in Transactions, Journals and Letters, and is 
subject to the general IEEE advertising requirements stated in this 
subsection. Advertisements in print or digital facsimiles of print 
products  of these periodicals shall be positioned only on the inside 
front cover or the inside or outside back covers, or at the back of the 
issue. Advertisements in other electronic products of these periodicals 
shall not interfere with the text or other elements of a technical article . 
F. ADVERTISING IN MAGAZINES  
Advertising is permitted in Magazines subject to the general IEEE 
requirements stated in this subsection.  
G. ADVERTISING IN NEWSLETTERS  
Advertising is permitted in newsletters, including free ads, when 
approved by the sponsoring organizational unit’s administrative body. 
Such advertising is subject to the general IEEE advertising 
requirements stated in this subsection.  
H. ADVERTISING IN IEEE SPECTRUM, THE INSTITUTE , PROCEEDINGS OF 
THE IEEE , and IEEE ACCESSTM 
1. All advertising arrangements shall be handled by the IEEE Media 
department staff.  
2. The advertising rates shall be set as part of the budget 
development process of each publication.  
3. The net income from advertising will revert to the general 
treasury of IEEE.  
4. PSPB is assigned the responsibility of monitoring the suitability 
of the advertising and its adherence to the above requirements.  
I. ADVERTISING IN CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS  
Conference publications, such as programs, digests and Conference 
Proceedings, may carry advertising subject to the general IEEE 
requirements stated in this subsection.  
J. ADVERTISING IN IEEE SPONSORED CONFERENCES  
The following advertising procedures are guidelines for IEEE 
conferences, where IEEE has 50% or more financial sponsorship.  
1. No advertising should be placed in a conference publication 
unless authorized by the conference organizing committee. If 
the conference organizing committee wishes to have advertising 
in a conference publication, the request may be made a part of 
the co nference budget approval procedures.  
2. To enable the IEEE to act as a clearinghouse for advertising 
information and to provide guidance to other conferences, it is 
desired that the following information be included with the 
request:  
a. For print or digital facsimiles of print conference 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   94 publications, the number of copies to be printed and to 
whom they will be distributed.  
b. Advertising rates to be charged.  
c. The method of soliciting advertising.  
3. All advertising arrangements will be handled by the conference 
organizing committee or its designated agent.  
4. The advertising rates will be set by the conference organizing 
committee.  
5. The net income from advertising will be received by the 
conference.  
6. The conference organizing committee is assigned the primary 
responsibility of monitoring the suitability of the advertising and 
its adherence to the above requirements.  
(See also IEEE Policies, Section 10, MEETINGS, CONFERENCES, 
SYMPOSIA AND EXPOSITIONS.)  
K. ADVERTISING IN VIRTUAL JOURNALS  
Advertising is permitted in Virtual Journals subject to the general IEEE 
requirements stated in this subsection.  
L. WEBSITE ADVERTISING  
From IEEE Policies, Section 6.7 – IEEE Websites  
Websites directly associated with the IEEE can be designated as the IEEE Main Website, 
IEEE organizational unit websites, IEEE partner websites, and the IEEE Web Presence. 
These terms are defined as follows.  
A. IEEE Main Website . The IEEE Main Website (http://www.ieee.org) is the collection of 
sections and pages within the IEEE.org parent domain that includes elements such 
as the site header and footer and follows the look and feel of http://www.ieee.org. 
This website is the prim ary entry point into the IEEE Web Presence and serves as an 
access point to other IEEE organizational unit webs ites and IEEE partner websites.  
B. IEEE Organizational Unit Websites . IEEE organizational unit websites are public or 
secure websites that represent IEEE or an IEEE organizational unit, and are 
authorized to carry the IEEE brand by virtue of their official affiliation with IEEE. 
These websites may be established as a sub -domain or exist outside of IEEE.org 
domain.  
Advertising is permitted on the IEEE Main Website 
(http://www.ieee.org) or an IEEE organizational unit  website with the 
permission of the website owner. Such advertising is subject to the 
general IEEE policy on advertising, which is specified in this 
subsection, and website advertising shall also conform to the following 
procedures. This includes websites of IEEE conferences, where IEEE 
has 50% or more financial sponsorship.  
1. Website visitors shall have the option to “click on” or not to 
“click on” the advertisement. Visitors shall not be sent to a 
commercial website unless they choose to do so by “clicking on” 
the advertisement. Visitors shall not be prevented from 
returnin g to an IEEE website or to other previously viewed 
screens, nor shall the visitor be redirected to a website they did 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   95 not intend to visit.  
2. Advertiser websites shall not redisplay, reuse, or frame the IEEE 
website content without the express permission of IEEE.
3. The IEEE Media department shall maintain a Website Advertising 
Fee Schedule that lists their discounted IEEE Media department 
(house) website advertising rates. The schedule shall be 
reviewed at least annually. IEEE organizational units are not 
required  to use the schedule and can set their own advertising 
rates. However, IEEE organizational units and staff  
departments, who enlist the services of the IEEE Media 
department, will be eligible for the discounted website 
advertising rates for their products a nd/or services. House rates 
are rates lower than what is charged external advertisers.  
M. ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS  
IEEE publication  classifications not specifically mentioned in the 
foregoing may carry advertising only with the consent of PSPB.   
Revisions to Subsection  8.1.8 – Advertising in IEEE Information Services and 
Products, as contained in this manual, require the review and approval of the 
IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -
300.4(5).   
8.1.9  Electronic Information Dissemination  
A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRONIC INFORMATION 
DISSEMINATION  
1. The requirements in this subsection  shall apply to all articles 
submitted to IEEE journals, transactions, letters, magazines, 
and conference publications. The requirements of this 
subsection do not apply to articles published under IEEE open 
access conditions . 
2. The terminology used in this subsection is defined as follows:  
a. An author -submitted article is the version originally 
submitted by the author to an IEEE publication. An author 
includes a completed IEEE Copyright Form during 
submission of the article to an IEEE publication and 
thereby transfers the copyright of the article to IEEE.  
b. An accepted article is a version which has been revised by 
the author to incorporate review suggestions, and which 
has been accepted by IEEE for publication.  
c. The final, published version is the reviewed and accepted 
article, with copy -editing, proofreading and formatting 
added by IEEE.  
d. E-prints are digital texts of research articles . Electronic 
preprint is a form of an e -print where an author posts a 
draft article on the author’s or another web site. For 
purposes of this definition, a preprint is assumed to be 
the article in the form prior to submission to the IEEE, at 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   96 which point copyright is transferred to IEEE. Authors who 
have submitted articles for publication by the IEEE may 
be interested in posting various preprint versions of the 
same article on e -print servers operated by third parties. 
E-print servers provide a uthors rapid dissemination of 
new results, with the opportunity of receiving comments 
from the peer community and with the opportunity to 
have a time -stamp associated with the announcement of 
results. 
3. IEEE seeks to maximize the rights of its authors and their 
employers to post preprint versions of an article on the author’s 
personal web site, on a server operated by the author’s 
employer, or on a server operated by an approved not -for-profit 
third pa rty as specified in 8.1.9.G.2 below.  
4. IEEE allows its authors to follow mandates of agencies that fund 
the author’s research by posting accepted versions of their 
articles in the agencies’ publicly accessible repositories.  
5. IEEE does not restrict the rights of authors to use their IEEE -
copyrighted articles in their own teaching, training, or work 
responsibilities, or those of their institutions or employers.  
In any preprint version archived by the author after submission, 
IEEE requires that IEEE will be credited as copyright holder. 
Upon publication of the work, authors are asked to include the 
article’s Digital Object Identifier (DOI).  
6. As indicated in Subsection  8.1.9.A.4 (above) and amplified in 
Subsection s 8.1.9.C through G below, IEEE’s policy for 
permitting posting of IEEE -copyrighted articles extends only to 
authors, their employers, approved third -party not -for-profit 
organizations, and IEEE organizational units. The IEEE 
Publishing Ethics & Conduct  Office maintains a list of not -for-
profit third -party servers where material submitted to the IEEE 
may be posted.  
B. COPYRIGHT NOTICE  
In any electronic posting permitted by this Subsection  8.1.9, the 
following copyright notice must be displayed on the initial screen 
displaying IEEE -copyrighted material:  
“© 20xx IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted. Permission 
from IEEE must be obtained for all other uses, in any current or future 
media, including reprinting/republishing this material for advertising or 
promotional purposes, creating new collec tive works, for resale or 
redistribution to servers or lists, or reuse of any copyrighted 
component of this work in other works.”  
C. PERSONAL SERVERS  
Authors and/or their employers shall have the right to post the 
accepted version of IEEE -copyrighted articles on their own personal 
servers or the servers of their institutions or employers without 
permission from IEEE, provided that the posted version inc ludes a 
prominently displayed IEEE copyright notice (as shown in 8.1.9.B, 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   97 above) and, when published, a full citation to the original IEEE 
publication, including a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Authors shall 
not post the final, published versions of their articles.  
D. E-PRINTS  
Before submitting an article to an IEEE publication, authors frequently 
post preprints of their articles to their own web site, their employer’s 
site, or to another server that invites constructive comment from 
colleagues and provides a publication time st amp. Upon submission of 
an article to IEEE, an author is required to transfer copyright in the 
article to IEEE, and the author must update any previously posted 
version of the article with a prominently displayed IEEE copyright 
notice (as shown in 8.1.9.B) . Upon publication of an article by the 
IEEE, the author must replace any previously posted electronic 
versions of the article with either (1) the full citation to the IEEE work 
with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), or (2) the accepted version only 
with the DOI (not the IEEE -published version). IEEE shall make 
available the accepted manuscript  for posting  that includes the Digital 
Object Identifier (DOI), IEEE’s copyright notice, and a notice indicating 
the article has been accepted for publication by IEEE. This service is 
available to authors who received an article proof for review through 
the IEEE Autho r Gateway. Authors who did not receive an article proof 
through the Gateway must consult with lead publication volunteers to 
ensure that they have the appropriate version of the article for 
posting.  
E. CLASSROOM OR INTERNAL TRAINING USE  
An author is expressly permitted to post any portion of the accepted 
version of his/her own IEEE -copyrighted articles on the author’s 
personal web site or the servers of the author’s institution or company 
in connection with the author’s teaching, training , or work 
responsibilities, provided that the appropriate copyright, credit, and 
reuse notice from 8.1.9.B (above) appears prominently with the 
posted material. Examples of permitted uses are lecture materials, 
course packs, e -reserves, conference presenta tions, or in -house 
training courses.  
F. COLLECTED WORKS  
IEEE organizational units wishing to place previously published 
collected works, such as Transactions, Journals, Magazines, conference 
proceedings/digests or collections of published articles on their web 
sites for limited -time promotional purposes must re quest permission 
from the IEEE Permissions  Office. Such permission will be contingent 
upon the placement of prominently displayed copyright and reuse 
notices. Another condition in granting permission will be that the 
posted collected work includes a monito ring mechanism (e.g., simple 
password protection) for authorizing access to the material.  
G. THIRD -PARTY RIGHTS TO POST IEEE -COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL  
1. With the exception of approved servers as indicated in 
Subsection  8.1.9.A.3 above and specified in 8.1.9.G.2, no third 
party may post IEEE -copyrighted material without obtaining the 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   98 necessary licenses or permissions from the IEEE Permissions  
Office or other authorized representatives of the IEEE, and only 
under terms approved by PSPB.  
2. The IEEE permits posting on certain approved third -party 
servers. The list of approved servers shall be reviewed annually, 
and a complete and up -to-date list shall be maintained by the 
IEEE Publishing Ethics & Conduct  Office. The process by which a 
third-party server can gain acceptance to the approved list is 
given in 8.1.9.G.4.  
3. The same rules regarding versions that apply to individual IEEE 
authors shall be enforced for third -party hosting. Specifically, 
the rules of 8.1.9.C will apply.  
4. PSPB shall have the authority to approve or disapprove a third 
party for hosting IEEE copyrighted content. Approval of third -
party hosting shall only be granted to not -for-profit 
organizations. Application to become an approved third -party 
host of IEEE copyrighted content must be made to PSPB. All 
applications shall be received and reviewed by the Chair of PSPB 
along with a two -member committee that the Chair appoints. 
The committee shall make recommendations for approval or 
disapproval to PSPB, and PSPB  shall vote on acceptance at the 
first meeting to occur after receiving the recommendation.   
5. Third parties that are approved by PSPB to host IEEE content 
shall be included on a list maintained by the IEEE Publishing 
Ethics & Conduct  Office.   
8.1.10  Post Publication Changes  
A. If an error is discovered within the metadata records for periodicals, 
conferences proceedings, standards, press books, educational courses, 
or multimedia files contained on IEEE Xplore, a request for correcting 
the error may be submitted to the Managing Director, IEEE 
Publications . Requests shall identify the error, recommend an 
appropriate correction to the metadata, and provide a statement of 
justification for correcting the error. Verification of errors may include 
review and approval by the authoritative individual or body for the 
publication record (such as the Editor -in-Chief, conference organizer, 
organizational unit, etc., or designee).  Only correction requests for 
content of a substantive nature shall be considered.  Acceptable  
requests include, but are not limited to, an author name is either 
missing or spelled incorrectly; author affiliation is incorrect or missing; 
title of publication is incorrect; author order is incorrect; publication 
has missing te xt; publication has missing or incorrect graphics or 
figures; publication has an error in publication identifiers (DOI, ISSN 
or ISBN); and publication has been truncated or is missing pages. 
Such requests should be verifiable from comparing original 
submis sions with the published work or the requester has provided 
sufficient documentation to justify the correction. Unacceptable 
requests are those that alter the author’s original intent of the article , 
or that involve a possible breach of publications policy . 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   99 B. IEEE considers retraction a mechanism for correcting the literature and 
alerting readers to publications that contain such seriously flawed 
analysis or erroneous data that their findings and conclusions cannot 
be relied upon. Unreliable data may result from honest error or from 
research misconduct. Retractions are also used to alert readers to 
cases of redundant publication, plagiarism, and failure to disclose a 
major competing interest likely to influence interpretations or 
recommendations.  
Retracted articles should not be removed from printed copies of the 
publication nor from electronic archives, but their retracted status 
should be indicated as clearly as possible.  
IEEE recognizes the importance of the integrity and completeness of 
the scholarly record to its community. IEEE attaches the highest 
importance to maintaining trust in the authority of its IEEE Xplore 
Digital Library archive and recognizes that the scholar ly archive should 
be a permanent, historic record of the transactions of scholarship. 
Therefore, articles that have been published shall remain extant, exact 
and unaltered as much as possible. However, extraordinary 
circumstances may arise where a publishe d article must later be 
retracted or even removed.  
Requests to retract or remove an article will be reviewed to determine 
whether retraction or removal is appropriate. The Managing Director, 
IEEE Publications shall assign the investigation and validation of 
requests for retraction or removal to staff withi n the IEEE Publications 
department. Verification of requests shall include review by the 
authoritative individual or body behind the publication record (such as 
the Editor -in-Chief, conference organizer, organizational unit, etc.). 
Removal of articles is a ddressed in Subsection 8.1.11.  
C. The Managing Director, IEEE Publications  shall assign the 
investigation, confirmation, and correction of IEEE Xplore metadata to 
staff within the IEEE Publications department. Staff shall establish 
criteria and guidelines for correcting author m etadata records in IEEE 
Xplore.  These criteria and guidelines, and changes thereto, shall be 
approved by PSPB before application.  
D. If an error is confirmed or a retraction is approved by the PSPB Chair 
using the established criteria and guidelines, staff shall modify the 
IEEE metadata record itself and add an annotation to the bibliographic 
view in IEEE Xplore to describe the correction for the user. The full -
text document (e.g., PDF) associated to the m etadata shall be 
modified as warranted in cases of retraction and removal . 
E. If an author wishes to replace their published name with their 
preferred name for any reason, IEEE shall honor that request. Such 
changes shall be made upon validation of the identity of the requesting 
author. Change in the author list is considered rare a nd exceptional 
(see also Subsection 8.2.1.A).  
F. In the event a case cannot be resolved, the Vice President - 
Publication Services and Products, shall be the officer authorized to 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   100 determine a resolution. The resolution shall be final and not subject to 
appeal.  
G. Staff of the IEEE Publications department shall provide information at 
the last PSPB meeting of the calendar year summarizing actions taken 
during the immediate past 12 months.
Revisions to 8.1.10 – Correcting Metadata in IEEE Xplore, as contained in this 
manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).   
8.1.11  Removing Access to Content on IEEE Xplore  
Under an extraordinary situation, it may be desirable to remove  access to the   
content in IEEE Xplore  for a specific article , standard, or press book. Removal  
of access shall only be considered in rare instances : 
• The article contains content that could pose a serious risk if 
followed or acted  upon 
• The article’s content violates the rights to privacy of  a 
study participant  
• The article is defamatory or infringes on other legal  rights (for 
example,  copyright)  
• The article is subject to a court  order.  
A  Requests for removal may be submitted to the Managing Director, 
IEEE Publications. Such requests shall identify the publication and 
provide a detailed justification for removing  access.  
B. The IEEE Executive Director has designated that the Managing 
Director, IEEE Publications  shall assign the investigation and validation 
of requests, and removal of metadata access to staff within the IEEE 
Publications department. Staff shall establish criteria and guidelines for 
this process. Validation of requests shall include review and appr oval 
by the authoritative individual or body behind the publica tion record 
(such as the Editor -in-Chief, conference organizer, organizational unit, 
etc.). These cri teria and guidelines, and changes thereto, shall be 
approved by PSPB before application. The final decision for removal, 
however, shall remain with the Vice President - Publication Services 
and Products.  
C. If the request is validated and approved by the Vice President - 
Publication Services and Products, staff shall take the following 
actions:  
1. The original metadata record shall be retained, but staff shall 
annotate the record with a note regarding the status of access 
to the full -text document.  
2. The full -text document (e.g., PDF) associated to the metadata 
shall be handled with one of the following two actions, 
depending on the results of the investigation and evaluation.  
a. Remove original full -text document, and replace with a 
new notice that states the reason for removal: or  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   101 b. Retain original full -text PDF, but annotate with comments 
regarding the disposition of the claim.  
D. The Vice President - Publication Services and Products, shall be the 
officer authorized to determine a resolution. The resolution shall be 
final and not subject to appeal.  
E. Staff of the IEEE Publications department shall document each 
instance for record keeping, as well as provide an information report at 
the last PSPB meeting of the calendar year about actions taken during 
the immediate past 12 months.  
Revisions to 8.1.11 – Removing Access to Content on IEEE Xplore, as contained in 
this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using 
the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5). 
8.2 Publication Guidelines  
The IEEE supports the highest standards of intellectual discourse in its 
publications. All members of the publication process -- authors, editors and 
reviewers -- should be treated with fairness and balance,  and adhere to the 
principles in this subsection. These principles represent a minimum set of 
requirements. Individual publications may have additional requirements.   
(See also Subsection  2.6 Volunteer Responsibilities and the IEEE Code of 
Ethics)  
(See also I NTRO DUCTION  - Principles of Ethical Publishing)  
Revisions to the above paragraph require the review and approval of the 
IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -
300.4(5).  
Except where statements are limited to a specific publication type, this 
Subsection  8.2 applies to all IEEE publications, such as Journals, 
Transactions, Magazines, Letters, Conference Proceedings, Newsletters, and 
so forth. The person responsible for each of these  IEEE publication s, as 
determined by the body of the sponsoring IEEE organizational unit, is termed 
“the Editor *.” For Journals, Transactions, Magazines, and Letters, that person 
is the Editor -in-Chief, as defined in Subsection  2.4, whereas any ot her editor 
of the publication is termed “editor.”  
8.2.1  Publication Principles  
A. AUTHORSHIP  
Authorship and co -authorship should be based on a substantial 
intellectual contribution. It is assumed that all authors have had a 
significant role in the creation of an article that bears their names. 
Therefore, the list of authors on an article serves mu ltiple purposes; it 
indicates who is responsible for the work and to whom questions 
regarding the work should be addressed. Moreover, the credit implied 
by authorship is often used as a measure of the contributors’ 
productivity when they are evaluated for employment, promotions, 
grants, and prizes.  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   102 1. The IEEE affirms that authorship credit must be reserved for 
individuals who have met each of the following conditions:  
a. Made a significant intellectual contribution to the 
theoretical development, system or experimental design, 
prototype development, and/or the analysis and 
interpretation of data associated with the work contained 
in the article;  
b. Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or 
revising it for intellectual content; and  
c. Approved the final version of the article as accepted for 
publication, including references.  
Inclusion of deceased persons is deemed appropriate, as 
authors should be so included with a footnote reporting their 
death.  
2. In articles with multiple authorship, the order of the authors 
shall be at the discretion of the authors.  
3. Once the list and order of authors has been established, the list 
and order of authors should not be altered without p ermission of 
all living authors  of that article . Change  in the author  list is 
considered  rare and exceptional,  and the decision to allow such 
changes rests  with the Editor *. Exception to such decisions is in 
the case of a request by an author to change their name (see 
Subsection 8.1.10.D).  
4. Any part of an article essential to its main conclusions must be 
the responsibility of at least one author.  
5. In the case of articles with multiple authors, a “corresponding” 
author must be designated as having responsibility for 
overseeing the publication process and ensuring the integrity of 
the final document. The corresponding author accepts the 
responsibil ity for:  
a. Including as co -authors all persons appropriate and none 
inappropriate;  
b. Obtaining from all co -authors their assent to be 
designated as such, as well as their approval of the final 
version of the article as accepted for publication; and  
c. Keeping all co -authors apprised of the current status of 
an article submitted for publication, including furnishing 
all co-authors with copies of the reviewers’ comments and 
a copy of the published version, as  appropriate.  
6. Co-authors have responsibility for work submitted under their 
names. They should remain knowledgeable in so far as possible 
regarding the contents and status of the article, including the 
nature of any revisions.  
7. If an article is revised and resubmitted to the same journal, co -
authors should be asked by the corresponding author to reaffirm 
their assent to be listed as co -authors and to approve the 
revised version. In addition, if the article is rejected or 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   103 withdrawn from a journal and then submitted to a different IEEE 
journal, the co -authors should be asked again by the 
corresponding author to affirm their assent to authorship even if 
no substantive changes have been made.  
8. Co-authors added  at any time during  the review process  or when 
the final version of the article  is submitted  for publication shall  
satisfy  the requirements of authorship  outlined  in Subsection  
8.2.1.A.1,  and the corresponding  author  shall notify  the 
responsible  editor  regarding  addition of co-authors.  
9. A co-author  has the  right to withdraw that person’s  name  from 
an article  at any time  before  acceptance  of the article  by an 
editor. The corresponding  author  shall notify  the responsible  
editor regarding  removal  of co-authors . 
Revisions to the Subsection  8.2.1.A - Authorship, as contained in this 
manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
B. RESPONSIBILITIES OF AUTHORS OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BY IEEE  
1. Peer review is essential to discourse . Authors are encouraged to 
have the first formal publication of their results be a peer -
reviewed article.  
2. Financial support of the work being reported and of the authors 
should be clearly acknowledged in the article, as well as any 
potential conflict of interest.  
3. Methods and materials should be described in sufficient detail to 
permit evaluation and replication.  
4. All data should be presented upon request by an editor, to 
facilitate the review process.  
5. When submitting an article, authors shall disclose whether or  
 not the article has been published previously or if it is still under  
active consideration by another publication. In addition, if an 
author submits an article to a non -IEEE publication while that 
article is under review by IEEE, the author shall immediately 
notify IEEE about the additional submission.  
6. When submitting an article, authors shall disclose if the article 
reports on research using human subjects or animals and, if so, 
the authors shall adhere to the requirements as specified in 
Subsection 8.1.1.E . 
7. Upon request from IEEE, each author shall confirm having met 
the conditions of authorship as defined in Subsection 8.2.1.A.1  
 8.      Authors have an obligation to correct errors promptly.  
 9.      IEEE defines plagiarism as the use of someone else’s work (for 
example, use of text, prior ideas, processes, results, or 
algorithms ) without explicitly acknowledging the original author 
and/or source. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and is 
considered a serious breach of professional conduct, with 
potentially severe ethical and legal consequences. Subsection  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   104 8.2.4.D provides detailed guidelines for a) handling allegations 
of plagiarism, b) applying appropriate corrective actions when 
findings of plagiarism have been reached, and c) referencing 
previously published material.  
10.    The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an 
article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and 
code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any 
article submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used 
shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use 
AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a 
brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was 
used to generate the content.  
The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is 
common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of 
the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is 
recommended.  
11.     Fabrication or falsification of any aspect of an article is 
unacceptable.  
12. Except as indicated in IEEE Policies, Subsection  6.4 (Multiple 
Publication of Original Technical Material in IEEE Periodicals)  and 
Subsection  8.1.7 of this Manual , authors should only submit 
original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for 
publication, nor which is under review for another publication. If 
authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a 
basis for a new submission, they are require d to cite the 
previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new 
submission offers substantive novel contributions beyond those 
of the pre viously pu blished work(s). Subsection  8.2.4.G  
provides guidelines for handling instances of inappropriate 
multiple submission and prior publication.  
13. Authors should not discuss any aspect of an article under 
evaluation with reviewers of the submitted article.  
14. Only those articles of a researcher’s publication record that are 
directly relevant to the subject matter of the article under 
consideration should be included in the bibliography. 
Furthermore, an article shall be appropriately labeled as 
“submitted” whe n still in the review process or “accepted” when 
it has been accepted for publication but has not yet been 
published.  
15. The IEEE assumes that the material submitted to its publications 
is properly available for general dissemination to the readership 
of those publications. It is the responsibility of the authors, not 
the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their mate rial 
requires the prior consent of other parties and, if so, to obtain 
it. If authors make use of charts, photographs, or other 
graphical or textual material from previously published material, 
the authors are responsible for obtaining written permission  to 
use the material in the article.  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   105 16. An author, in offering an article for presentation at an IEEE 
conference, or accepting an invitation to present an article, is 
expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the article. In 
the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission  
of an article preclude its presentation by an author, the program 
chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute 
arrangements should be made. IEEE reserves the right to 
exclude an article from distribution after the conference (e.g., 
not placed on IEEE Xplore) if the article is not presented at the 
conference.  
17. Once an article has gone through the review process and a 
decision for final acceptance has been rendered, the 
corresponding author provides the final version of the article 
and supporting materials for publication. Any substantial and 
unauthorized chang es made to the accepted article during this 
final stage of the publication process must be communicated in 
writing to the Editor*, who then will decide if a re -review is 
necessary. This includes addition or removal of any citations. 
Failure of such notif ication may be considered as author 
misconduct, and at the discretion of the Editor* may be 
reported as such to the Vice President - Publication Services and 
Products . 
 
Revisions to the Subsection  8.2.1.B - Responsibilities of Authors of 
Articles Published by IEEE, as contained in this manual, require the 
review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process 
in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
C. REVIEWERS OF ARTICLES  
1. Reviewers should be chosen for their high qualifications and 
objectivity regarding a particular article.  
2. Reviews should be prompt and thorough.  
3. Anonymity of reviewers of a given article shall be preserved to 
the extent possible, unless the reviewer and editor agree to 
disclosure.   
4. Information contained in an article under review is confidential 
and shall not be shared with others.  An exception to this is 
when a reviewer requests assistance from a colleague as a 
second reviewer in the review process, such as a professor 
asking a student to assist as a form of training. In such cases, 
the reviewer from whom the review was originally r equested is 
responsible for the following: attention shall be given to 
potential conflict of interest or bias regarding authors of the 
article being reviewed, the confidentiality of the review pro cess 
shall be strictly maintained with both reviewers involved, and it 
shall be reported to the editor requesting the review that a co -
reviewer was used in the review process. In the case that the 
co-reviewer provides an independent review, the name of the  
reviewer shall be reported to the editor requesting the review.  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   106 5. Referees shall not use non -public information contained in an 
article to advance their own research or financial interests.  
6. Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under 
review shall not be processed through a public platform (directly 
or indirectly) for AI generation of text for a review. Doing so is 
considered a breach of confidentiality because AI systems 
generally learn from any input.  
 
D. EDITORS OF IEEE JOURNALS, TRANSACTIONS, LETTERS, AND 
MAGAZINES  
1. All editors of IEEE publications shall adhere to the highest 
standards of ethical publishing in handling submissions to the 
publication (see also Principles of Ethical Publishing). Actions 
taken by any editor generally intended to manipulate the peer 
review process for any article submitted for review shall be 
considered serious misconduct and may result in sanctions 
levied on that editor.  
2. The Editor -in-Chief is ultimately accountable for acceptance or 
rejection of an article, although the decision may be delegated 
to another editor of the publication.  
3. The Editor -in-Chief should generally grant the request of an 
author who asks, when submitting an article , that particular 
individual(s) be excluded from the review of that article . 
4. The Editor -in-Chief shall establish a review process that 
minimizes bias.  
5. The Editor -in-Chief shall subject all articles of a given type to 
equivalent and unprejudiced reviews. Decisions about 
acceptance for publication should occur in a reasonable time 
frame, and (except for issues devoted to special topics) articles 
should, to the editor’s best a bility, be published in the 
chronological order of acceptance.  
6. The Editor -in-Chief should provide to the authors a written 
rationale for editorial decisions regarding an article submitted 
for publication. This is especially important if the article is being 
rejected.  
7. Unpublished articles must be treated as confidential documents 
by all individuals involved in the editorial process.  
8. The Editor -in-Chief shall correct errors in an article if the errors 
are detected or reported before publication or publish 
corrections if they are detected afterward.  
9. The review process for technical articles submitted by the 
Editor -in-Chief of the publication shall be handled by another 
editor of the publication.  To avoid conflict of interest, the choice 
of editor to handle the submission shall be made through an 
independent process (excluding the Editor -in-Chief) as specified 
by the sponsoring organization(s) of the publication. The editor 
who handled the review p rocess shall make the decision for 
acceptance or rejection of such articles and is ultimately 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   107 accountable for that decision.  
The Editor -in-Chief or another editor of the publication may 
handle the review process for articles submitted by an editor of 
the publication other than the Editor -in-Chief. In such cases, the 
Editor -in-Chief or the editor delegated by the Editor -in-Chief to 
handle the review process shall make the decision regarding 
acceptance or rejection. The Editor -in-Chief is ultimately 
accountable for that decision.  
 Actions taken by any editor intended to manipulate the peer 
review process for their own submission or that of another 
editor shall be considered serious misconduct and may result in 
sanctions levied on that editor and others who participate in 
such actio ns. Such misconduct includes any breach of or 
demonstrated disregard for either the established practices of 
the IEEE peer review process or the IEEE Principles of Ethical 
Publishing. Perceived violations of this type should be reported 
to the IEEE Vice Pr esident –Publications Products and Services. 
Subsequent action is at the discretion of the Vice President, who 
may initiate investigation through the PSPB Publishing Conduct 
Committee or by other means and may determine possible 
sanctions.    
10.   The Editor -in-Chief or another editor of the publication shall not 
perform or accept any action that has the sole purpose of 
increasing the number of citations to influence the bibliometric 
independent measures of quality or impact of a periodical.
(See also Subsection  8.2.4 - Allegations of Misconduct, Part A – Handling 
Complaints.)  
8.2.2  The Review Process  
A. PERIODICALS   
The review process shall ensure that all authors have equal 
opportunity for publication of their articles. Acceptance and scheduling 
of publication of articles in these periodicals shall not be impeded by 
added criteria and procedures beyond those containe d in the IEEE 
review requirements contained in this Subsection  8.2.2.A.   
1. Responsibilities of Editors . The policies contained in this 
Subsection  8.2.2.A shall apply to the editors  of all regular 
technical periodical IEEE publications, except IEEE SPECTRUM 
and Society newsletters. Whereas the policies in this Subsection  
8.2.2.A primarily refer to actions by the Editor -in-Chief, these 
actions may be delegated to another editor of the publication. 
This includes the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection 
of an article, for which the Editor -in-Chief remains accountable 
as the highest authority on the publication.  
At no time should an article be accepted or published in an 
archival journal without prior review of the complete article by 
two or more  referees who are  conversant with the pertinent 
subject area , at least two of which are independent of persons 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   108 involved in the decision process for acceptance . Careful 
selection of referees shall be made to avoid any conflict of 
interest or bias with regard to authors of the article being 
reviewed (see also Subsection 2.6.2). Editors responsible for the 
final decision on an article shall not serve as a referee f or one of 
the independent reviews used in the decision for an article.  
 It is the responsibility of the office of Editor -in-Chief of each 
publication to see to it that the corresponding author receives a 
prompt written acknowledgment of the receipt of his or her 
article. This acknowledgment should include the date when the 
corresponding author can expect to receive the decision of t he 
Editor -in-Chief on the suitability of the submission for 
publication, which will be no longer than 90 calendar days from 
the date of receipt of the article by the Editor -in-Chief. 
 It is also the responsibility of the Editor -in-Chief to advise the 
corresponding author of the relevant IEEE policy concerning 
material submitted for publication, especially the contents of 
Subsection  8.2.1.A (Authorship) and 8.2.1.B (Responsibilities of 
Authors).  
2. Handling of Articles Authored by Publications Volunteers . 
Editorial responsibility and authority for any article authored by 
an editor and submitted to the editor’s publication shall be 
delegated to another qualified person. Editorial consideration of 
the article in any way or form by the author -editor shall 
constitute a conflict of interest and is therefore improper. All 
editors and referees shall immediately disqualify themselves 
from review of articles in which there exists a conflict of 
interest.  
 Editors and other volunteers involved in IEEE periodicals shall 
not abuse access privileges to obtain confidential information, 
particularly about the review results of their own articles. This  
includes any effort to form a coalition with others such as to  
manipulate the review process or other established IEEE   
publication practices. Doing so shall be considered serious  
misconduct. Intentional unauthorized access to confidential  
information about an IEEE publication shall be considered an act  
of misconduct, and suspected misuse of access shall be reported  
to the volunteer leader of the sponsoring organizational unit and  
to the PSPB Chair. The PSPB Chair shall be the IEEE Officer with  
cognizance of the case process, will oversee any investigation,  
and will be responsible for adjudication.  
 Organizational u nits shall establish procedures for their 
periodicals so that no one can acquire unauthorized access to 
privileged information and submit these procedures to the IEEE 
Publishing Ethics & Conduct  Office for filing. Documentation of 
these procedures shall include a statement about how articles  
by editors and other publication volunteers are handled.  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   109 3. Prescreening of Articles by Editors -in-Chief. Editors -in-Chief may 
prescreen articles  immediately after they are submitted and 
before they are transmitted to referees for evaluation. The 
purpose of such prescreening is to verify that the article adheres 
to minimum criteria set forth by IEEE, as well as by the 
organizational unit responsible  for the specific publication. 
Typical prescreening measures include the following:   
a. The author(s) have followed the IEEE guidelines for style.  
b. The author(s) have not obviously violated IEEE Policies.  
c. The article is comprehensible (in other words, not so 
poorly written that it is unreadable).  
d. The subject and contents of the article meet the scope of 
the periodical or a specific issue.  
e. The article meets a minimum criterion for technical 
substance established for the periodical.  
In the case of a prescreened rejection decision, if the Editor -in-
Chief assesses that a submission has met prescreening criteria 
3.a through 3.d but has not met criterion 3.e, and an appeal of 
this decision is made by the corresponding author to the Editor -
in-Chief,  the Editor -in-Chief shall subsequently consult with at 
least two members of the editorial board for concurrence. 
Rejection on the basis of criterion 3.e shall require the general 
agreement of the Editor -in-Chief and those consulted.  
 An article is considered in review if it passes the prescreening 
process and is forwarded to referees. An “administrative reject” 
refers to an article that does not meet the prescreening 
measures and is, therefore, returned to the author(s) with 
explanati on. 
 Organizational units that prescreen submitted articles, as 
enabled by this subsection, shall include a statement of the 
prescreening measures in the unit’s instructions to authors.  
4. Review of Articles by Referees . For all scientific articles and 
communications published in IEEE publication and information 
products, the Editor -in-Chief or another editor from the editorial 
board of the publication  shall select at least two referees who 
are competent and have experience in the area of the subject 
matter of the article. Editors -in-Chief of a specific periodical 
cannot act as formal referees for articles being considered for 
publication in their area of responsibility of that periodical. It 
shall be clearly stated by the Editor -in-Chief when the Editor -in-
Chief submits the article to the referee that the recipient is a 
formal reviewer and that his or her comments and opinions, 
with those of other formal reviewers, will form the basis upon 
which the Editor -in-Chief will decide whether or not to publish 
the article, and with what changes. Su bmission of articles  to 
referees for “informal review” is to be avoided. The Editor -in-
Chief shall state that the referee is expected to return 
comments and opinions within a specified time, not longer than 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   110 90 calendar days or else request that the article be returned 
immediately for submission to another referee. The use of a 
standard review form for each periodical is recommended. The 
office of the Editor -in-Chief shall maintain all records pertinent 
to submitted articles for a period of two years from the date of 
final disposition.  
 IEEE requires that referees treat the contents of articles under 
review as confidential information not to be disclosed to others 
before publication. It is expected that no one with access to an 
article under review will make any inappropriate use of the 
special knowledge that access provides. Contents of abstracts 
submitted to conference program committees should be 
regarded as confidential as well, and handled in the same 
manner.  
 The e ditor examines the comments of the referees and 
exercises his or her own best judgment, in the light of the 
referees’ recommendations, on whether or not to publish. 
Reviewers’ comments and marked articles  are normally returned 
to the author in any case. It is essential that the e ditor assure 
that the anonymity of the referees is  protected during this 
process.  
 Everything within this review process must be done openly, 
except that the referees are protected from personal 
interactions with the authors by withholding their names. The 
editor in any event, should be guided in technical matters b y the 
reviewers’ comments. The e ditor must not arbitrarily withhold 
the referees’ comments from the corresponding aut hor, or vice -
versa, unless the editor deems them clearly to be irrelevant, 
incorrect, or otherwise  inappropriate. In particular, e ditors 
should not arbitrarily ignore referees’ suggestions for 
modifications of the article without sufficient technical cause to 
do so. If an article is returned for revision, it is important to 
make clear to the corresponding author whether on the one 
hand the article will be accepte d if the indicated changes are 
made or, on the other hand, the article will be resubmitted to 
the referee for further review.  
Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under  
review shall not be processed through a public platform (directly  
or indirectly) for AI generation of text for a review. Doing so is  
considered a breach of confidentiality because AI systems  
generally learn from any input. Editors should convey this policy  
to referees when a review is requested.   
 In writing a review, it is unacceptable for a referee to require 
additional citations for the sole purpose of influencing 
bibliometric measures of either an individual or a periodical. In 
such cases, referee comments shall be transmitted to the 
authors, bu t editorial judgment shall be exercised in explaining  
requirements to the authors regarding addition of citations. The 
editor’s decision is always based on all the reviews received, but 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   111 mixed reviews present the need for the exercise of edit orial 
judgment. R esponsibility  for the final decision of accepta nce or 
rejection lies with the Editor -in-Chief. 
 Authors may request that their article’s review not be handled 
by specific editors and that their article not be reviewed by 
specific individuals. All reasonable requests of this nature shall 
be complied with.  
Periodicals which are published in cooperation with non -IEEE 
organizations must have a review policy that ensures the quality of the 
articles. The policies of the non -IEEE organizations should be generally 
consistent with the IEEE requirements contained in  this Subsection  
8.2.2.A.  
B. CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS  
1. Conference Submissions Review Process . Submission s to IEEE 
conferences shall undergo a review process by referees who are 
knowledgeable in the pertinent subject are a, and who are 
independent of persons involved in the decision process for 
acceptance . The manner of implementation of the process shall 
be defined by the appropriate governing body (e.g., Society, 
Region, Section, etc.) of the IEEE major sponsor organization. It 
is strongly recommended that the governing body use 
Subsection  8.2.2.A as a basis fo r their review process.  
Conferences that are held in cooperation with non -IEEE 
organizations are encouraged to have a review process that is 
consistent with the policy stated in the paragraph above. All 
conferences that intend to have their proceedings published in 
IEEE Xplore sh all have a review policy as stated in the above 
paragraph and have a memorandum of understanding between 
the IEEE organizational unit (or organizational units) and the 
non-IEEE entity (or entities) that includes the requirement for 
the review process. The appropriate governing body of the 
cooperating IEEE organizational unit shall establish the review 
process in agreement with the non -IEEE organization.  
Participants in the review process (i.e., referees and anyone else 
who is authorized to handle conference submission s) shall treat 
the contents of conference submission s under review as 
confidential information not to be disclosed to others before 
publication. No one with access to a submission  shall make any 
inappropriate use of the special knowledge that access provides.   
2. Prescreening of Conference Submissions . This part of Subsection  
8.2.2.B only applies to conference proceedings where IEEE is 
the copyright holder, which includes proceedings from all 
conferences where IEEE is the sole financial sponsor.  
Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to ensure that 
publications from their conferences that are posted in IEEE 
Xplore  adhere to minimum criteria set forth by IEEE, as well as 
by the responsible organizational units. The minimum standards 
for scope and quality shall include the following:  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   112 • The subject and contents of each article are within 
the stated subject matter or the scope of the 
conference, and are within the IEEE fields of 
interest.  
• The author(s) has/have not obviously violated IEEE 
Policies.  
• Each article is comprehensible (in other words, not so 
poorly written that it is unreadable ). 
• Each article meets a minimum criterion for 
technical substance established for the conference.  
Conference organizers and/or conference sponsors have the 
right to prescreen conference submissions and, if a submitted 
article fails to meet any of these standards, exclude that article 
in the conference publication from being posted on IEEE Xplore . 
Conference organizers shall inform each author that the article 
has been excluded from IEEE Xplore because it was out of scope 
and/or of poor quality.  
Organizers shall also clearly communicate the following to all 
authors prior to or at the time of article submission (with special 
attention paid to the “call for papers”):  
“IEEE reserves the right to exclude a submission 
from distribution after the conference, including 
exclusion from IEEE Xplore , if the submission  does 
not meet IEEE standards for scope and/or quality.”  
Articles excluded from further distribution shall be archived by 
IEEE but shall not be indexed or appear on IEEE Xplore . 
If an out -of-scope or poor -quality article is included in the 
proceedings distributed onsite to attendees and the organizers 
subsequently elect to exclude that article from further 
distribution, organizers are still required to provide that article 
to IEEE  publications. As the publisher of the conference 
proceedings, IEEE must have in its possession the complete set 
of proceedings of every conference.  
A conference shall inform IEEE publications if it decides not to 
prescreen articles and/or exclude out -of-scope or poor -quality 
articles from its conference publications. In all cases, IEEE 
reserves the right to exclude out -of-scope or poor -quality 
article s from IEEE Xplore. The IEEE will inform the involved 
conference organizers of any hold on uploading. It is the 
responsibility of conference organizers to inform each author 
that an article has been excluded from IEEE Xplore because it 
was out of scope or of poor quality.  
 
C. PLAGIARISM DETECTION  
Plagiarism is a threat to scholarly publishing in general and to IEEE’s 
publication program in particular. Originality of the submitted work can 
be maximized through screening to prevent publication of plagiarized 
content. For maximum effectiveness among I EEE periodicals and 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   113 conferences, all IEEE articles shall be submitted to a plagiarism 
detection process prior to being uploaded to IEEE Xplore.
Publication volunteers are encouraged to utilize a plagiarism detection 
process to prescreen all articles upon submission. Any article found to 
have plagiarized content at Level 1, 2 or 3 , as defined in Subsection  
8.2.4.D, shall have its review suspended. Editors and conference 
organizers shall inform each author that review of their article has 
been suspended due to its similarity to previously published work and 
provide the author with an opportunity to explain t he similarity. If the 
investigating editor or conference organizer finds that no plagiarism 
has occurred, the article should be released for the normal review 
process.  
Any content of a periodical or conference publication that has not been 
screened upon submission to IEEE shall be submitted by IEEE to a 
plagiarism screening process prior to being sent to IEEE Xplore.  IEEE 
will examine articles found to have a high similarity to previously 
published work. Any article found to have plagiarized content at Level 
1, 2 or 3 , as defined in Subsection  8.2.4.D, will be excluded from 
upload to IEEE Xplore pending investigation by responsible editors or 
conference organizers. The IE EE will inform the involved editors or 
conference organizers of any hold on uploading. It is the responsibility 
of editors and conference organizers to inform each author that an 
article has been excluded from IEEE Xplore due to its similarity to 
previousl y published work, and to provide the author with an 
opportunity to explain the similarity. If the investigating editor or 
conference organizer reports to IEEE that no plagiarism has occurred, 
the article shall be released for upload to IEEE Xplore.   
D. MONITORING THE REVIEW PROCESS  
Misconduct of any type during the review process undermines the 
position of trust held by the IEEE in the community, and constitutes a 
serious threat to the reputation of IEEE and to the role of scientific 
research in society. PSPB shall be responsible for  implementing and 
maintaining a sufficient system of practices, tools, and analysis to 
monitor and analyze IEEE’s review activities at all stages and for all 
published content. The goals of such practices shall be to detect, 
identify and prevent any form o f misconduct or behavior not consistent 
with the IEEE Code of Ethics, the IEEE Principles of Ethical Publishing, 
or any relevant policy in the PSPB Operations Manual. All forms of 
data, metadata, and other information relating to the review process 
conduct ed by any organizational unit within the IEEE shall be made 
available as required by PSPB in order to achieve these goals.  
PSPB shall be responsible for formulating a description of the 
monitoring practice for the review process, and for distributing 
reporting to stakeholders on a regular basis.  
(See also 8.1.4 - IEEE Copyright Policy and Procedures  and Subsection  8.2.4 
- Allegations of Misconduct.)  
Revisions to Subsection  8.2.2 – The Review Process, as contained in this 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   114 manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.2.3  Appeal of Editorial Decisions  
The editorial policy of an IEEE publication or information product shall be 
determined by the organizational unit which sponsors or controls the 
publication, within the framework and policies set by PSPB and the IEEE 
Board of Directors. Implementation of t hese policies shall be the 
responsibility of the Editor*  of the publication. The process for resolution of 
appeals of editorial decisions shall be carried out by other editors 
independent of the editor who made the decision, with consultation from 
leadersh ip at the sponsoring organizational level when necessary. Disputes 
which arise over review or acceptance of material submitted for publication 
are expected to be resolved by the editorial leadership  of the publication. The 
Editor*  shall be, in general, the final authority on matters of content and 
appropriateness of material in the publication.  
In the event of a challenge to review or publishing actions which cannot be 
resolved at the sponsoring  organizational u nit level, the Vice President - 
Publication Services and Products shall be the IEEE Officer with cognizance of 
the appeals process. An appeal of an editorial decision must be submitted 
within 60 calendar days of final notification of the decision to the Managing 
Director, IEEE Publications who will acknowledge receipt of appeal and inform 
the Vice President - Publication Services and Produc ts within 30 calendar 
days. The Vice President - Publication Services and Products shall, within 30 
calendar days of receipt of a written appeal, determine whether the dispute 
merits a formal arbitration process. For arbitration, the Vice President - 
Publication Services and Products shall appoint an individual who shall, in 
consultation with all the parties to t he dispute and with the assistance of 
knowledgeable members of the professional community, assess the merits of 
the dispute and recommend a resolut ion. The recommendation shall be 
presented to the Vice President - Publication Services and Products for review 
within 120 calendar days of the receipt of the complaint. The decision, which 
shall be binding on the IEEE organizational unit that is party to the dispute, 
shall be made within 15 calendar days of the receipt of the recommendation 
by the Vice President - Publication Services and Products, and shall be 
reported to PSPB. The decision of the Vice President - Publication Services 
and Products shall b e final and not subject to further appeal.  
Revisions to Subsection  8.2.3 – Appeal of Editorial Decisions, as contained in 
this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.2.4  Allegations of Misconduct  
For clarification, Subsection  8.2.4 applies to all IEEE publications, and the use 
of “the Editor *” refers to the person responsible for the publication (e.g., 
Transactions, Magazine , Conference Proceedings,  etc.). Sources of 
allegations are treated separately in the following sections: Subsection 
8.2.4.A.1 specifically addresses allegations that originate from those involved 
with the publication process of a submitted article, and Subsection 8.2.4.A.2 
addresses alle gations (publishing misconduct complaints) of any kind, 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   115 providing an anonymous reporting route.
A. HANDLING ALLEGATIONS  
1. When a possible publishing misconduct is detected by those 
involved with the publication process of a submitted article, then 
the matter must be referred to the Editor* who shall then notify the 
IEEE Publishing Ethics Team (PET) regarding the allegation and 
notify the PET when initiating an investigation. The purposes of 
these notifications are to provide information, create a record, and 
serve as notification to the Managing Director, IEEE Publications, 
and the Vice President, Publication Services and Products, e ither 
directly or through a reporting chain, that an allegation of 
publishing misconduct has been received (and is being investigated 
if that is the case).  
Further action may be taken by the Vice President, Publication 
Services and Products, who may initiate investigation through the 
PSPB Publishing Conduct Committee or other means and determine 
possible sanctions . 
2. Allegations about publishing misconduct of any kind may also be 
reported directly to the IEEE PET, which shall also accept 
anonymous allegations. The IEEE PET shall then notify the 
Managing Director, IEEE Publications, and the Vice President, 
Publicatio n Services and Products, either directly or through a 
reporting chain, that an allegation of publishing misconduct has 
been received (and is being investigated if that is the case). 
Subsequent action is at the discretion of the Vice President, 
Publication Services and Products, who may initiate investigation 
through the PSPB Publications Conduct Committee or other means 
and determine possible sanctions. During the handling of an 
allegation, the contents of the allegation, identity of the persons 
involved, a nd the scope of the inquiry shall remain confidential to 
the extent practicable, consistent with the need to provide 
information in support of an expeditious review. If an allegation is 
sent directly to the Editor*, other members of the editorial board of 
an IEEE publication, any volunteer or a member of IEEE staff, these 
individuals shall forward the allegation to the IEEE PET prior to 
engaging directly with the person making the allegation.  
3. In handling a case of alleged plagiarism, the following basic 
information should be made available : 
a. The alleged plagiarized work : 
(1) Title of article  
(2) Full list of author name s 
(3) Any other information necessary to identify the 
alleged, plagiarized work  
b. The use of someone else’s unpublished ideas:  
(1) Description  of idea  
(2) Full list of creators  
(3) Verifiable date of creation  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   116 c. Full name and email address of the person making the 
allegation (if not anonymous) .  
d. The alleged plagiariz ing article:  
(1) Title of article  
(2) Full list of author names  
(3) Any other information necessary to identify the 
publication in which the article appeared  
e. Copies of both the plagiarized work and the alleged 
plagiarizing  or, if appropriate, documentation of an idea 
and the alleged plagiarizing article, preferably with 
highlighted text showing all instances of alleged, 
inappropriate reuse  
4. If an allegation  is received concerning the accuracy or 
completeness of a n article published in an IEEE publication, the 
person responsible for that publication shall investigate the 
allegation . If it is ascertained that the allegation  stems from  
differences in opinion, the responsible person shall dismiss the 
allegation  and notify the person making the allegation  of the 
conclusion. The  responsible person may also recommend that 
the person making the allegation  prepare and submit a rebuttal 
for publicati on. 
5. Specifically for cases of editorial misconduct (also see below), 
the accused individual shall be notified of the allegation only by 
the PSPB Chair at the conclusion of the investigation. The PSPB 
Chair shall offer the accused individual the opportunity to 
respond within 30 calendar days. Any decisions, including 
possible sanctions, shall be communicated no later than 90 
calendar days after notifying the accused individual. The PSPB 
Chair will issue a final determination of corrective action(s) to be 
taken and notify the person making the allegation, the Vice 
President(s) of Publications of the sponsoring Society(ies) or the 
similarly empowered officer(s), and the accused individual. The 
decision of the PSPB Chair shall be final and not subject to 
further appeal.  
6. If an allegation  is received against the Editor*, another  editor, 
or reviewer of an IEEE publication, one of the following steps 
applies depending on the allegation . 
a. If the complaint concerns the judgment of the Editor* in 
the rejection of an article, then the person making the 
allegation  shall be informed that the Editor* has final 
decision -making authority over such matters . 
b. If the allegation is communicated directly to the Editor* 
and is against an editor of the editorial board  or referee , 
the Editor* shall evaluate the merits of the allegation , 
determine the appropriate course of action in accordance 
with established policies, and respond to the person 
making the allegation . If the accused person is an editor 
and an investigation ensues, only the PSPB Chair shall 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   117 notify the accused editor (see Subsection 8.2.4.A.5).  
c. If the allegation  involves a claim of bias on the part of the 
Editor*, then the person making the allegation  may 
appeal directly to the designee of the organizational unit 
responsible for the publication (such as the Vice President 
- Publications, the Chair of the Publications Committee, 
etc.) or to its chair (such as the Society President). If 
such a position do es not exist, the allegation  should be 
made to the PSPB Chair who shall then investigate the 
allegation in accordance with Subsection 8.2.3. Only the 
PSPB Chair shall notify the accused individual in such 
cases. Upon completion of the investigation, the PSPB 
Chair’s findings shall be sent to the Editor* , the 
responsible person(s) for the sponsoring IEEE 
organizational unit(s), and the person making the 
allegation . The decision of the PSPB Chair shall be final 
and not subject to further appeal.  
d. If the allegation  is against the Editor* or another editor of 
the editorial board for violation of the principle regarding 
the publication’s bibliometric independent measures as 
specified in Subsection 8.2.1.D. 10, then the allegation  
should be made directly to the PSPB Chair who shall then 
investigate the allegation. In this case, upon completion 
of the investigation, the PSPB Chair’s findings shall be 
sent to the Editor*, the responsible person(s) for the 
sponsoring IEEE organization al unit(s), and the person 
making the allegation . The decision of the PSPB Chair 
shall be final and not subject to appeal . 
Revisions  to Subsection  8.2.4.A – Handling Allegations of Publishing 
Misconduct , as contained in this manual, require the review and approval of 
the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw 
I-300.4(5).  
B. INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE AUTHOR MISCONDUCT  
1. If the Editor* learns that an author may have acted improperly, 
which may include but is not limited to misrepresenting data, 
plagiarizing text, or not informing the Editor* that an article had 
been published, accepted for publication, or concurrently u nder 
review by another publication, then the Editor* shall investigate 
the alleged misconduct  and notify the IEEE PET as described in 
Subsections 8.2.4.A.1 or 8.2.4.A.2 . All inquiries shall be handled 
promptly and fairly. To the extent possible, all partie s relevant 
to the allegation shall be contacted at the start of the 
investigation and given the opportunity to respond.  
2. The IEEE PET may contact the Editor* to discuss the allegations 
and the appropriate process for adjudication . 
3. In considering the allegation, the Editor* shall appoint an 
independent ad -hoc committee of experts in the topic to 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   118 confidentially investigate and make a recommendation on the 
allegation to the Editor*. In addition to the material supplied by  
the Editor*, the ad -hoc committee may seek other sources of  
relevant information, such as the IEEE Publishing Ethics & 
Conduct  Office. However, the ad -hoc committee shall not 
contact institution where the work was performed unless it has 
explicit information that such institution has already 
investigated the issue.  
Revisions to 8.2.4.B – Investigating  Possible Author Misconduct, as contained 
in this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of 
Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
C. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR AUTHOR MISCONDUCT  
1. If a finding of misconduct relevant to an IEEE publication (data 
misrepresentation/fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submission, 
or prior publication, etc.) is made by the person responsible for 
the IEEE publication, then appropriate corrective and/or 
disciplinary actions shall be initiated.  Such actions may include 
prohibition from publishing and holding any editorial role in all 
IEEE publications for a period up to and including lifetime 
prohibition, as determined by the PSPB Chair.  
2. For all cases involving alleged plagiarism or the multiple 
submission/publication of the same article, the responsible 
person shall inform the PSPB Chair of the investigating 
committee’s conclusions or recommend action(s) in accordance 
with Subsection 8.2. 4.D “Guidelines for Adjudicating Different 
Levels of Plagiarism” and Subsection 8.2.4.G “Guidelines for 
Adjudicating Prior Publication, Multiple Submission, and Reuse of 
Previous Publications.” For cases in which a decision by the

Revisions to Subsection  8.2.4.C – Corrective Actions, as contained in this 
manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4( 6). 
D. GUIDELINES FOR ADJUDICATING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PLAGIARISM  
The following guidelines require or recommend appropriate corrective 
actions to be taken by editors of IEEE publications for each of f our 
defined levels (or degrees) of plagiarism. Plagiarism includes, but is 
not limited to, (a) uncredited copying and/or paraphrasing of someone 
else’s work, (b) using someone else’s material without clear 
delineation or citation, and (c) uncited reuse of an author’s previously 
published work that also involves other authors. Guidelines for 
referencing of other peoples’ work are covered in Subsection  8.2.10. It 
should be noted that plagiarism is a type of copyright infringement, 
and as such may also subject the author(s) to legal liability. These 
guidelines apply to all articles at any point in the publication process, 
from initial submission to final publication.  
The following corrective actions must be taken, absent special 
circumstances that provide good cause for varying some or all of the 
specified measures. Such special circumstances must be identified in 
writing to, and the variation approved by, the PSPB Cha ir. The PSPB 
Chair may grant leniency regarding sanctions to first -time offenders in 
the plagiarism resolution process. If granted, leniency would only be 
with respect to periods of prohibited publishing and inclusion on the 
Prohibited Authors List (see Subsection  8.2.4.E). In such cases, 
sanctions shall be enforced unless an author education process on 
plagiarism (as determined by PSPB) is completed by the individual(s) 
within 30 calendar days of notification, constituting resolution of the 
plagiarism process. IEEE staff will maintain a list of individuals that 
have completed the author education process.  
In the following description of the corrective actions, general terms are 
used to describe the portions of work plagiarized: major portion, large 
portion, and significant portion. In cases of verbatim copying, these 
descriptors are generally characterized as follows: a major portion 
represents 50% or more plagiarized material; a large portion 
represents 20% to 50% plagiarized material; and a significant portion 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   120 represents up to 20% plagiarized material. Delineation of these levels 
is determined in the adjudication process.   
Proposed corrective actions related to level 1 or 2 of the following shall 
be approved by the PSPB Chair. Furthermore, a number of the 
corrective actions below either require or allow notice of the offense to 
be placed in the IEEE electronic database and/or in the relevant 
publication.  
1. Plagiarism of a Major Portion of a Published Work . [The most 
extreme case of plagiarism is when (a) a major portion of a 
published work  is copied  (verbatim or paraphrased) without 
acknowledgment and any name of the original author list is

published work (such as, but not limited to ideas, processes, 
results, data, and algorithms) are used without explicitly 
acknowledging the original author and/or source ], or  
 Plagiarism  of a Major Portion  within a Single Article . [An 
instance is where a large section of the original  published work 
or a large portion of the main contributions of the plagiarized

through 8.2.4.1.c, noting that different authors and 
multiple editors might be involved.  
(2) For instances where plagiarized material in one or 
more of the discovered articles  represents the 
equivalent of a major portion , corrective actions 
shall be assigned to each offense following the 
guidelines in Subsection s 8.2.4.1.a through 
8.2.4.1.c, and the PSPB Chair has the discretion of 
applying any combination of the assigned 
corrective actions that the Chair considers 
appropriate.

repetitive level -1 misconducts, the PSPB Chair can 
administer up to and including a lifetime prohibition of 
publication in all IEEE publications.  For repeated level -1 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   122 misconducts, the PSPB Chair may administer up to and 
including a lifetime prohibition of holding any editorial role 
in all IEEE publications.  
2. Plagiarism of a Large Portion within a n Article . [An instance is 
where a section of the article plagiarizes a published work 
without quotation marks, credit notice, reference, and 
bibliography. This case also includes instances where different 
portions of a n article plagiarize without attribution from a 
number of published works , and the sum results in a large 
portion of plagiarized material in the article.], or  
Plagiarism within More than One Article by the Same Author(s) . 
[This case includes instances where the sum of plagiarized 
material from the different articles would constitute the 
equivalent of a large portion of the plagiarized published work  
with the fewest words.]  
a. In this case corrective actions that shall be taken are:  
(1) Publication of a Post-publication Notice for 
Publishing Misconduct , as specified in Subsection  
8.2.4.F , in the IEEE electronic database as part of 
the article’s bibliographic record

(3) Possible prohibition of publication in all IEEE -
copyrighted publications by the offending 
individual(s) for up to three years as determined by 
the organizational unit’s publications officer, 
subject to approval by the PSPB Chair  
(4) If a publication prohibition is imposed against the 
offending author(s), a prohibition from holding any 
editorial role in all IEEE publications may also be 
imposed. If imposed, the editorial prohibition shall 
be for a period no less than the publicatio n 
prohibition duration, as determined by the PSPB 
Chair.  
(5) Rejection and return of all articles by the author(s)

E. PROHIBITED PARTICIPANTS  LIST 
The Prohibited Participants  List (P PL) provides information about 
individuals  who have been found to have violated IEEE Principles of 
Ethical Publishing, appearing in the Introduction of this manual,  and 
who have been prohibited from participating in specific IEEE publishing 
activities . In this context “participants” refers to individuals such as, 
but not limited to, authors, reviewers, editors, conference technical 
program committee  chairs, and so forth. The P PL includes the names 
of offending participants , their email addresses, professional affiliations 
at the time the misconduct was discovered, the area(s) of participation 
where the restrictions apply, and the time duration of the resulting 
restrictions . The P PL is shared primarily with volunteers who are 
directly involved with the review process for manuscripts submitted to 
IEEE. Volunteers are encouraged to consult with the IEEE Publishing 
Ethics & Conduct  Office to confirm the identity of any individual  whose 
name appears to match a name on the PPL . Volunteers are required to 
treat the contents of the P PL as strictly confidential and, therefore, 
shall not share the P PL with anyone not directly related to IEEE 
publishing activities or not responsible for appointing volunteers to key 
publishing positions.  
To ensure corrective actions are enforced effectively pursuant to 
Subsection  8.2.4.D, IEEE shall  
1. Maintain a list of individuals  who have been prohibited from 
participating in IEEE publishing activities , and 
2. Make this list available to IEEE volunteers as deemed 
appropriate by the Vice President  - Publication Services and 
Products.  
Although the P PL is used primarily to enforce corrective actions related 
to publishing misconduct, it is recognized that  IEEE Organizational 
Units may wish to use the P PL when reviewing nominations of 
individuals to positions of leadership or decision -making roles involving 
IEEE publications , or nominations for awards and recognitions related 
to the individual’s service or performance within IEEE . Requests for 
access to the PPL to be used for these purposes, in accordance with 
the Organizational Unit’s rule s and procedures, should be sent to the 
IEEE Publishing Ethics & Conduct Office. Received  requests will be 
presented to the Vice President - Publication Services and Products for 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   126 approval . 
F. POST -PUBLICATION NOTICES FOR PUBLISHING MISCONDUCT  
After an adjudication process is complete, post -publication notices for 
articles  deemed to have violated the principles of ethical publishing 
include Retraction Notices, Removal Notices, Expressions of Concern, 
and Violation Notices. All notices shall be factual, objective, and avoid 
inflammatory language. The PSPB Chair shall approve the content of all 
such notices published by IEEE.  
1.  Retraction Notices The mechanism to issue a retraction notice 
has been defined in subsection 8.1.10.B of this manual. An 
article retracted because of adjudicated misconduct should not 
be removed from printed copies of the publication nor from 
electroni c archives, but the retracted status shall be indicated as 
clearly as possible. IEEE shall publish a notice of retraction 
explaining the reason(s) for the retraction. Notices of retractions 
shall state who initiated the retraction.  
2.  Removal Notices In rare circumstances, it may be desirable to 
remove access to the content in IEEE Xplore for a specific 
article, standard, or press book. When this occurs, a removal 
notice shall be published as outlined in Subsection 8.1.11.  
3.  Expressions of Concern Expressions of Concern (EOCs) are 
notices published to alert readers of serious concerns about 
published work. In some cases, an EOC may be published as an 
interim notice while an issue is still under investigation. An EOC 
may al so be used as a resolution to a post -publication case if it 
is concluded that some issues remain unresolved. After an EOC 
is published, the same article may be corrected or retracted, or 
the EOC itself may be corrected or retracted, depending on new 
assess ment of information, data, and/or materials received in 
subsequent investigations.  
4. Violation Notices A Violation Notice shall be used to precede an 
IEEE publication for which a violation of IEEE’s Publication 
Principles has been ascertained and such violation does not rise 
to the level that a retraction, removal, or EOC notice should be 
issued.  
G. GUIDELINES FOR EDITORIAL REUSE OF PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED 
MATERIAL,  AND ADJUDICATING INAPPROPRIATE REUSE OF PREVIOUS 
WORK OR THE FAILURE TO INFORM EDITORS OF PREVIOUS 
PUBLICATIONS OR MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS.  
The following procedures are presented in light of support of the 
evolutionary publication paradigm presented in Subsection  8.1.7. F. 
1. Editorial Reuse of Previously Published Material . The Editor of a 
publication may choose in a limited number of cases and 
following Subsection  8.1.7.A to republish existing material for a 
variety of reasons including serving readers by aggregating 
special material in a single publication. When such a 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   127 republication occurs, the articles must be annotated as being 
republished, and their original publication venue provided as a 
special note in the front page of the article.  As necessary, 
appropriate permission shall be obtained.  
2. Author Obligations to Cite Previous Work . If author(s), within 
the evolutionary publishing paradigm, have used their own 
previously published or submitted material as a basis for a new 
submission, Subsection  8.2.1.B. 9 requires that the author(s) 
cite the previous work(s) and very clearly indicate how the new 
submission differs from the previously published work(s). 
Guidelines for referencing of author’s previous work are covered 
in Subsection  8.2.10. Authors who do not properly cite their 
previous work and who are found not to be in compliance wi th 
the requirements of Subsection  8.2.1.B. 12 are also subject to 
corrective actions.  
a. In these cases , corrective actions that shall be taken are:  
(1) Offending individual(s) will be reminded that the 
practice is considered inappropriate scholarly 
practice, referred to Subsection s 8.2.1.B. 12 and 
8.2.10, and notified that repeated offenses could 
result in correction actions as specified in 
Subsection  8.2.4. G.3.b. 
b. In cases of a second offense, corrective actions that shall 
be taken are:  
(1) A formal warning to offending individuals stating 
that, if additional offenses are discovered, action 2c 
shall occur  
c. An additional offense following action 2b shall result in 
suspension of publication privileges in all IEEE 
Publications for one year and rejection and return of all 
articles by the author(s) that are currently in review or in 
any IEEE publication’s queu e (articles may be re -
submitted after suspension term has expired).  
 Proposed corrective actions related to level -2c violations of 
Subsection  8.2.4.G .2 shall be approved by the PSPB Chair.  
3. Author Obligations to Inform the Editor*  of Previous Work . As 
described in Subsection  8.2.1.B. 12, authors should only submit 
original work that has neither appeared elsewhere for 
publication, nor which is under review for another refereed 
publication. Multiple submissio n is defined as a given article  
being concurrently under active consideration by two or more 
publications. It is at the discretion of each IEEE Organization 
Unit whether or not to allow multiple submission s. Authors shall 
inform the Editor * of multiple submissions of articles. Authors in 
violation of these multiple -submission guidelines are subject to 
corrective actions.  
a. At the time of article submission, or during the review of 
an article, the Editor* was not informed that the article 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   128 had been published.  
(1) In this case, corrective actions that shall be taken 
are: 
(i) A formal warning to offending individual(s)  
(2) In this case, corrective actions that may also be 
taken are:  
(i) Offending individual(s) prepare and submit 
an apology to the Editor* of the publication 
editor  
(ii) Publication of the offending author’s apology.  
(3) Discovery of a second offense shall result in:   
(i) Another formal warning to offending 
individuals stating that, if additional offenses 
are discovered, action a(4) shall occur  
(ii) Suspension of publication in the IEEE 
publication where the offense took place by 
the offending individual(s) for one year of 
the publication or, if appropriate, the next 
volume of the conference proceedings . 
(4) An additional offense following action a(3) of 
Subsection  8.2.4.G .3 shall result in suspension of 
publication privileges in all IEEE Publications from 
three to five years as determined by the PSPB 
Chair and rejection and return of all articles by the 
author(s) that are currently in review or in any 
IEEE publication’s qu eue (articles may be re -
submitted after suspension term has expired).  
b. Lack of disclosure to the Editor*  by the author(s) that the 
article is under active consideration by another 
publication. Individual publications can choose to either 
accept or reject outright concurrent consideration of 
articles. Authors should be made aware of the 
publication’s policy o n this matter.
(1) In case authors fail to inform the Editor*  of other 
consideration of the article, corrective actions that 
shall be taken are:  
(i) Offending individual(s) will be reminded that 
the practice is considered inappropriate  
scholarly practice, referred to Subsection s 
8.2.1.B. 12 and 8.2.7, and notified that 
repeated offenses could result in correction  
actions as specified in 8.2.4.G .2.b.  
(2) Discovery of a second offense shall result in:  
(i) Another formal warning to offending 
individuals stating that, if additional offenses 
are discovered , action a(3) of Subsection  
8.2.4.G .3 shall occur   
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   129 (3) An additional offense following action b(2) of 
Subsection  8.2.4.G .3 shall result in suspension of 
publication privileges in all IEEE Publications for 
one year and rejection and return of all articles by 
the author(s) that are currently in review or in any 
IEEE publication’s queue (articles may be re -
submitted after susp ension term has expired).  
Proposed corrective actions related to level  a(4) or b(3) of Subsection  
8.2.4.G .3 shall be approved by the PSPB Chair.  
(See also Subsection  8.1.7 – Multiple Publication of Original Technical 
Material in IEEE Periodicals and Subsection  8.2.1.B – Responsibilities of 
Article Authors.)  
H. RELATIONSHIP TO  THE IEEE CODE OF ETHICS  
Violations of Subsection  8.2.4 may also constitute violations of the 
IEEE Code of Ethics. Beyond the application of adjudication guidelines 
of Subsection  8.2.4.D, the complainant, if an IEEE member, may bring 
the case to the IEEE Ethics and Member Conduct Committee upon the 
completion of all appropriate investigations and actions through the 
respective organizational unit and PSPB.
8.2.5  Transactions, Journals and Letters  
A. Periodicals with TRANSACTIONS, JOURNAL or LETTERS in the title are 
the primary means for publication of technical articles concerning 
original work in IEEE fields of interest. These periodicals may also 
contain reviews and tutorial articles concerning such work. The 
primary purpose of these periodicals is to disclose, and provide a 
permanent archival record of original technic al work that advances the 
state of the art or provides novel insights. Articles in these periodicals 
should be of lasting value to the profession as judged by the authors’ 
peers through a formal review process.

8.2.9 Newsletters  
Newsletters are usually published by IEEE organizational units (Boards, 
Committees, Societies, Councils, Sections, and Chapters). Newsletters are 
not considered archival periodicals, although they may be archived by the 
organizational units.  
Newsletters are normally distributed only to members of the organizational 
unit as a member benefit,  and are intended to communicate news and 
information deemed of interest to the members. Typical information includes: 
reports on organizational -unit activities, messages from officers and editor s, 
letters from the readers, calls for articles , news from chapters, meeting 
notices, conference reports, awards publications of interest to the readers.  
Newsletters may also contain technical articles of general interest to the 
members. Documents for the purpose of informing members about a 
conference, meeting, special event, or any other items of interest shall not 
be titled a Newsletter. Such publication s should be titled bulletin, 
announcement, news release, organizational -unit notice, or other descriptive

d. Volume and/or issue number  
e. Date of issue  
3. Frequency of Publication . Newsletters can be published at any 
frequency, but three (3) issues or more per year are 
recommended. However, if a United States second -class non -
profit postal permit is used, it is a requirement of the U.S. Postal 
Service that the newsletter be published  four (4) times within 
the calendar year.  
4. U.S. Postal Permits . All requests for United States second -class 
postal permits must be made through Publishing Operations of 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   134 the IEEE Publications department, which holds the main permit

application. Applications for third -class bulk rate permits may be 
submitted directly to any local post office.  
5. Pricing and Subscription . The newsletter shall be supplied to 
each organizational -unit member at no additional charge. Free 
access or copies of the newsletter may be given to nonmembers 
at conferences, meetings, etc., to encourage them to join IEEE 
and/or the organizational unit. Society and Technical Council 
newsletters may be made available for sale in order to 
accommodate the needs of libraries and non -IEEE members. 
Newsletters that are offered for sale shall contain intellectual

8.2.10 Referencing Guidelines  
A. An article submitted for publication to IEEE should be original work 
submitted to a single IEEE publication. The article should not have 
been published previously and should not be concurrently under 
consideration for publication elsewhere. The IEEE assume s that 
material submitted to its publications and information products is 
properly available for general dissemination for the readership of those 
publications and products. It is the responsibility of the authors, not 
the IEEE, to determine if disclosu re of their material requires the prior 
consent of other parties. If prior consent is required, then authors 
must obtain permission prior to article submission.  
Recycling of material in a new document happens when the material in 
the new document is identical, or substantively equivalent in both form 
and content, to that of the source. At times, it may be necessary for 
authors to recycle  portions of their own previously published work or 
to include another author’s  material.  
B. When an author uses text, charts, photographs, or other graphics from 
another author’s material, the author shall:  
1. Clearly indicate reused material and provide a full reference to 
the origin (publication, person, etc.) of the material and  
2. Obtain written permission from the publisher or, if the reused 
material has not been published, obtain written permission from 
the original source.  
C. When an author recycles  text, charts, photographs, or other graphics 
from his/her own previously published material, the author shall:  
1. Adhere to all copyright policies, c learly indicate all recycled  
material and provide a full reference to the original publication 
of the material (see also Subsection 8.2.4.G).  
2. If the previously published or submitted material is used as a 
basis for a new submission, clearly indicate how the new 
submission differs from the previously published work(s).

8.3.4  THE IEEE PRESS  
The IEEE PRESS is operated to serve the information needs of members and 
the profession. It accomplishes this by publishing books and electronic media 
of high quality and usefulness, by co -publishing with non -IEEE organizational 
units, and by distributing products of other publishers. Authors and editors 
benefit from the success of books by sharing incentive royalties with book 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   139 sponsors. The governing body of the IEEE PRESS  is the IEEE PRESS Editorial 
Board, which provides advice and counsel to the PSPB and IEEE PRESS. The 
IEEE PRESS Editorial  Board and the IEEE PRESS shall operate according to 
procedures in this subsection . 
Proposals from individuals, from Societies and from other IEEE organizational 
units are welcome. Publication decisions are reached by the  IEEE PRESS 
Editorial Board  in consultation with the Managing Editor of the IEEE PRESS, 
and in accordance with standard publishing practices or as directed by the 
IEEE PRESS Editorial Board . 
A. SPONSORSHIP  OF BOOK S AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA  
1. Books and electronic media may be sponsored by an IEEE 
organizational unit, such as a Society, Council , or the EAB. To 
qualify as a sponsor, the organizational unit must meet the 
following conditions:   
a. A sponsor should be an existing, continuing IEEE 
organizational unit. An ad hoc body formed solely for the 
purpose of sponsoring a book would not normally qualify.  
b. The operational responsibilities of the sponsor should be 
such as to qualify it to take responsibility for the technical 
organization of the book and to identify potential buyers 
and promote the book within the sponsor’s membership, 
in accordance with t he terms of the sponsorship 
agreement.  
2. Sponsors shall share in the royalties according to a scheme that 
recognizes the extent of their contribution to the project. The 
royalty schedule shall be set forth from time to time by the IEEE 
Press Editorial Board and approved by PSPB.  
3. Books and electronic media proposed by the IEEE PRESS, or by 
individuals to the IEEE PRESS, that fall predominantly in the 
field of one organizational unit will be referred for further 
consideration to that organizational unit as the most appropriate 
sponsor. Books that overlap the fields of several entities without 
falling predominantly into the field of any one organizational unit 
may be cosponsored by several Units. The IEEE PRESS reserves 
the right to sponsor books referred to such IEEE organizationa l 
units, when they fail to act on the books or decline to sponsor  
4. All books and electronic media issued under the IEEE PRESS 
imprint are subject to review and acceptance by the IEEE PRESS 
Editorial Board.  
Revisions to Subsection  8.3.4 – IEEE PRESS, as contained in this manual, 
require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the 
process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).

8.4 Methods and Processes  
8.4.1  Approval of New Periodicals  
A. INTENT  
The intent of this policy is to enable IEEE Major organizational units to 
introduce new publications of a previously established type in a timely way 
while, at the same time, allow adequate oversight of all IEEE publications.  
B. PUBLICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS  
This policy applies to all formal publications designed to disseminate 
technical, professional, or news material in furtherance of IEEE’s 
educational and scientific goals. Excepted from this approval policy are 
the following:  
1. Region, Section, Society/Council Newsletters  
2. Conference Publications  
3. Publications of the IEEE Standards Association  
4. IEEE PRESS Books and Society Press Books  
5. Internal administrative communications such as newsletters for 
committee members.
 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)  141 
 
 
 All these types of publications can be approved by the sponsoring 
Major organizational unit itself, who shall take full responsibility for 
their content and appropriateness.   
C. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  
Any proposal for a new periodical shall include at least the following 
information:  
1. Description and title of periodical, including frequency of 
appearance, methods of dissemination, and length of each 
issue.  
2. Evidence that the topic of the periodical is within the 
organizational unit’s field of interest and does not conflict with 
another IEEE periodical.  
3. Evidence that there is sufficient interest in the proposed content 
and that the number of potential articles  and size of the 
readership is sufficiently large to establish a viable new 
periodical with a long -term potential.  
4. Three -year financial plan.  
In addition, the periodical’s sponsoring organizational unit shall 
undertake to ensure that quality standards for IEEE publications will be 
met.  
It is recommended that the Editor -in-Chief and other staff be selected 
before proposal submission and their names be included in the 
proposal. Otherwise, the proposal shall include assurances that these 
individuals will be appointed in time to facilitate on -time production of 
the first issue.  
D. APPROVAL PROCESS  
There are two ways of gaining approval for new periodicals of an 
established type; traditional and expedited. If a publication is to be 
included in the annual member billing and promotional cycle, approval 
must be obtained on or before 30 June.  
1. Traditional . In the traditional process, the sponsoring 
organizational unit must first gain the approval of the Major 
organizational unit to which it reports. Then the documentation 
specified in Subsection  8.4.1.C along with the major 
organizational unit’s endorsement must be received by the 
Managing Director, IEEE Publications at least four weeks prior to 
the PSPB meeting at which the proposal is to be considered. It is 
recommended that a representative of the sponsoring 
organizational unit attend this meeting to present the proposal 
and answer questions.  
2. Expedited . In order to be eligible for expedited approval, the 
major organizational unit to whom the periodical’s sponsoring 
unit reports must have defined a process to be followed, which 
incorporates at least all the items in Subsection  8.4.1.C, is 
approved by PSPB, and is on file with the Managing Director, 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   142 IEEE Publications . For each publication thus approved, the 
organizational unit shall forward for information purposes a copy 
of the documentation to the Managing Director, IEEE 
Publications . The Managing Director, IEEE Publications , will bring 
to the attention of PSPB any approvals that appear to be non -
compliant.  
Revisions to Subsection  8.4.1 – Approval of New Periodicals, as contained in 
this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, 
using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.4.2  Major Changes to an Existing Publication Product or Service  
A. PUBLICATION PROGRAM REVIEWS  
While the following assessments are not mandatory, they are strongly 
recommended.  
Organizational u nits should perform strategic reviews of all of their  
existing publication products and prog rams at least every five years.  
• Program or Product Attractiveness: Involving factors 
contributing to judgments about whether the program or 
product  is attractive to the organization as a basis for current 
and future resource deployment  
• Competitive Position: Involving factors contributing to 
judgments about whether the organization is in a position to 
support the program  
• Alternative Coverage: The extent to which other organizational 
units can, or may be positioned to serve the same customers 
through similar programs.  
The results of these investigations should at least answer the following 
questions:  
• Does the existing program support goals, objectives, and 
strategies of the organizational unit?  
• Does the product  or program meet the needs of members and 
customers?  
• Does the organizational unit desire and have the ability to 
continue support?  
• Does the existing product program need to be repositioned, 
enhanced, or discontinued?  
It is recommended that the organizational unit utilize the Strategic 
Program Assessment Guide  available from the IEEE Corporate Strategy 
Office. The organizational unit should inform the responsible Major 
Board about the review results. If the organizational unit determines 
that a product or program requires a major change, the organizational 
unit shall follow the process in Subsection  8.4.2.B to implement the 
change. Some examples of a major change include a merger of 
publications, dramatically redirecting an operation, and ending a 
publication product or service. Questions about what constitutes a  
major change should be directed to the (1) Vice President of the 
responsible Major Board, and (2) Managing Director, IEEE Publications , 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   143 or the PSPB Chair.  Determination of what constitutes a major change 
must be made by both the (1) Vice President of the responsible Major 
Board and (2) Managing Director, IEEE Publication s, or the PSPB Chair.  
B. PROCESS FOR MAJOR CHANGES TO AN EXISTING PUBLICATION 
PRODUCT OR SERVICE  
1. The sponsoring organizational unit shall conduct a strategic 
program assessment of the product or program as specified in 
Subsection  8.4.2.A.  
2. A proposal for the desired change shall be prepared that 
includes at least the following information:  
a. Title of publication product or program  
b. Statement of the desired change  
c. Justification for the change, such as the results of the 
required review  
d. An evaluation as to possible conflict with any other 
existing IEEE publication product or program  
e. Names of the individuals responsible for implementing the 
change  
f. If appropriate, a timeline for implementing the change  
g. A financial impact statement that includes a three -year 
financial plan for ma jor expansions.   
3. The proposal shall be reviewed and approved by the responsible 
Major Board, including its Finance Committee.  
4. The procedure for change shall be reviewed by PSPB or the 
responsible Major Board to ensure that any major change is 
conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to members 
and/or customers, preserves IEEE’s reputation, protects IEEE’s 
intellectual p roperty rights, and allows coordination with the 
IEEE Publications Department so needed changes to IEEE Xplore 
and the IEEE Business Management System can be made.  
5. Any major change to an IEEE -wide publication supervised by 
PSPB shall be reviewed and approved by the IEEE Board of 
Directors.  
Revisions to Subsection  8.4.2 – Major Changes to an Existing Publications 
Product or Service, as contained in this manual, require the review and 
approval of the IEEE Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with 
IEEE Bylaw I -300.4(5).  
8.4.3  Publication of Periodicals Outside the IEEE  
Publication of periodicals outside the IEEE is permitted only with the approval 
of PSPB and the Board to which the sponsoring organizational unit reports. 
Approval shall only be granted when the conditions below have been met. 
Periodicals that are publishe d under the supervision of IEEE staff are defined 
as published inside the Institute. All others are considered to be published 
outside the Institute. Periodicals that are not published under the supervision 
of IEEE staff are termed as being published “Outs ide the IEEE.”  
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   144 A. The sponsoring organizational unit shall submit a written proposal for 
such publication, with which the relevant Director concurs.  
B. There shall be a potential distinct cost or time advantage for 
comparable quality, or if the expected advantage is other than cost or 
time, that expected advantage shall be stated in the proposal.  
C. Quotations shall be obtained from at least two sources other than the 
IEEE for production of the periodical.  
D. The sponsoring organizational unit shall have a functioning broad -
based publishing organization, including a Publications Committee, an 
Editor -in-Chief and other editors of the editorial board  or equivalent.  
E. The above publishing organization shall have demonstrated proven 
performance capabilities and knowledge in the publications field.  
F. If possible, the transition to outside publication shall start with the first 
issue of the calendar year.  
G. An annual review shall be made for three years after a transition to 
publication outside IEEE is made and thereafter at least every five 
years, with more frequent review at the discretion of PSPB.   
H. All contracts for outside publication shall be handled through the IEEE 
Publications department. (Sponsoring organizational -unit officers may 
make initial, exploratory negotiations, but the final documents are 
subject to review by and signature of Managing Director, IEEE 
Publications , or that person’s  designated agent.)  
I. The sponsoring organizational unit shall continue to pay its appropriate 
share of the fixed costs established for the IEEE Publications 
department for a period of three years following withdrawal from the 
use of the IEEE Publications -department services  for the publication of 
organizational -unit periodicals. The schedule of said fixed costs per 
page shall be determined by the Managing Director, IEEE Publications . 
It shall reflect the then current conditions in the IEEE Publications 
department and shall r eceive the approval of PSPB. Then, the 
sponsoring organizational unit shall pay its fee according to the sliding 
scale as follows.  
1. In year one of the three -year recovery period, the fee is based 
on the number of pages currently published by the periodical 
times the fixed cost per page.  
2. In year two, the fee will be 2/3 of the annualized fixed costs.  
3. In year three, the fee will be 1/3 of the annualized fixed costs.  
 In summary, the total is equal to fixed costs for two years. Any 
services of the IEEE Publications department in connection with the 
transition to outside publication, or required to correct deficiencies in 
the performance of the outside publisher, will b e billed separately and 
shall be an additional responsibility of the sponsoring organizational 
unit. 
Revisions to Subsection  8.4.3 – Publication of Periodicals Outside the IEEE, 
as contained in this manual, require the review and approval of the IEEE 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   145 Board of Directors, using the process in accordance with IEEE Bylaw I -
300.4(5).  
8.4.4 Second  Class Mailing Permits  
IEEE Policies, Section  6.5 – Second Class Mailing Permits  
All IEEE periodicals which use U.S. Post Office Second Class, nonprofit bulk rates for 
domestic mailing shall have their original entry request and their periodic audits handled via 
IEEE Publications Department. This is to ensure that the required audit documentation is 
completely done and thus protect this special mailing classification both for the specific 
publication and the other periodicals of IEEE. Part of the requirements is that in each case 
there be established a member price for the publication.  
Third Class bulk rate permits, as an alternate to Second Class, may be applied for directly at 
any local Post Office.  
8.4.5 Conference Publication  Identification  
 (extracted f rom) IEEE Policies , Section 10.1.2 – Sponsorship  
The three types of conference sponsorship available to IEEE organizational units are 
described below:  
(extracted f rom) Sole Sponsorship . 
Sole sponsorship indicates full and sole organizational unit involvement in a conference. If 
an IEEE organizational unit agrees to sponsor a conference, they accept complete 
responsibility for the technical, financial, publicity and administrative aspects of the 
conference.  
– .   .   .   .  
– will be responsible for proper usage of the IEEE name (Policies, Section 10.1.16) and the 
IEEE logo (Policies, Section 10.1.17).  
- Conferences where the IEEE has sole sponsorship, the rights to the conference name, 
slogan, copyright for publications, and/or logo are owned by IEEE and not conference 
committees.  
(extracted f rom) Technical Co -Sponsorship  
Technical Co -Sponsorship indicates direct and substantial involvement by the IEEE 
organizational unit solely in the organization of the technical program. The IEEE 
organizational unit has no financial involvement in the conference. The organization that ha s 
financial sponsorship of the conference must be explicitly identified in the supporting 
documentation and promotional material for technical  co-sponsorship to be granted. 
Technical co -sponsorship requires specific approvals as indicated in General Approvals, 
Endorsements, & Notifications – Organizational Unit Approv al (Policies, Section 10.1.4). The 
IEEE organizational unit should encourage members to submit papers and attend the 
conference. The IEEE organizational unit may assist in publicity through the availability of 
the appropriate IEEE organizational unit mailing lists and on the organizatio nal unit’s 
website. The relationship between sponsoring organizations shall be explicitly defined in 
terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) (Policies, Section 10.1.5). Technical co -
sponsorship does not guarantee that the papers accepted for presentat ion at the conference 
will be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Conference Publications Program (CPP), which 
handles post -conference distribution of conference papers in all media. Inclusion in the CPP 
should be specifically addressed in the MoU regulatin g the technical co -sponsorship, with the 
concurrence of the CPP staff. The IEEE name may not be used in the conference title 
(Policies, Section 10.1.16), but, the IEEE brand/logo and/or IEEE organizational unit 
brand/logo may be used in conference publicat ions and promotional materials (Policies, 
Section 10.1.17). The non -IEEE organization provides the IEEE organizational unit with the 
option of a no cost exhibit booth, exhibit table or other means of promoting IEEE 
membership and activities during the conf erence (Policies, Section 10.1.5).
 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   146 (extracted f rom) IEEE Policies , Section 10.1.20 – Conference Publications  
Conferences typically produce proceedings that are provided at the conference to attendees 
and/or are available for sale after the conference. Ownership of these publications is 
determined by copyright.  
Publications resulting from conferences solely sponsored by IEEE shall follow the procedures 
in the PSPB Operations Manual. Conferences in which the lead sponsor is not an IEEE 
organizational unit(s) are urged to follow these policies and procedures. Title, format and 
content shall conform to procedures which shall be specified in the PSPB Operations Man ual. 
Post conference distribution of these publications may be handled by the IEEE Conference 
Publications Program (CPP), which facilitates inclusion in the portfolio of IEEE electronic 
dissemination products. Participation in this program requires the completi on of the IEEE 
Conference Publication Form, which should be submitted to IEEE Conferences , Events , and 
Experiences  (CEE). This form allows the proceedings to be considered for post -conference 
distribution through the CPP. IEEE sponsoring organizational units makes the initial  decision 
on participation and terms, with the concurrence of the CPP.  
Publications resulting from conferences solely sponsored by IEEE shall be 
governe d by the following procedures . Technical  co-sponsored  conferences  in 
which the lead sponsor is not an IEEE organizational unit are urged to use 
these guidelines.  
A. CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS TITLES  
1. The titles of conference proceedings containing full articles  shall 
be unique and address the conference contents. A conference 
proceedings title shall begin with the word “IEEE” when an IEEE 
organizational unit is the sole or lead sponsor. The word “IEEE” 
shall not be used in the title of a conference proceedings i f an 
IEEE organizational unit does not financially support the 
conference. It is recognized that in some cases the year should 
also be included in the conference proceedings title.  
2. A conference proceedings title shall remain consistent for each 
time the conference is held and shall follow the guidelines that 
govern conference titling. Each title shall include the year in 
which the specific conference is held.  
3. Conference proceedings titles that have remained consistent for 
at least four years and have been assigned an ISSN 
(International Standards Serial Number) are to continue using 
that title and are otherwise exempt from the guidelines in 
Subsection  8.4.5.A.2.  
4. Proceedings subtitles may be used to reflect specific yearly topic 
variations and must appear below the approved proceedings 
title on electronic media, as well as the spline and title page of 
the printed version or on the main screen of the digital version . 
5. Proceedings titles must appear on the physical media, as well as 
the spline and title page of the printed version or on the main 
screen of the digital version and copyright page.  
B. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
1. The production cost of such IEEE conference proceedings will be 
borne by the conference or sponsoring organizational unit.  
2. Every conference proceedings will be identified by an IEEE 
 
IEEE PSPB Operations Manual, Amended 15 April 2025 (250415)   147 catalog number(s), an ISBN(s) (International Standard Book 
Number), a Library of Congress number and, possibly, an ISSN 
printed on its front or back cover and the back of the title page 
to be assigned in advance by the TAB Conference Publications 
Product M anagement Group. The IEEE catalog number must
