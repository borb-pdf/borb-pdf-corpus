                                         Bounds  for sorting by prefix reversal                           57
      5. Discussion
         We presented an algorithm sorting any permutation                  of length n in about Sn/3
      prefix reversals; improving the multiplicative constant seems to be quite challeng-
      ing. We also described a technique for deriving lower bounds for fen), and
      showed how it can be used to establish that fen) ~ 17n/16. Improving on this
      particular lower bound does not appear too hard; in fact, we conjecture that for
      our "hard" permutation          X, f(x) = 19n/16. Also, slightly better lower bounds may
      be conceivably proved by using different T's-of                length 7, say. However, we do
      not know how the upper and lower bounds can be narrowed significantly.
      Naturally, it is not clear at all that f(n)/n        converge~, and hence it may be that no
      better bounds are attainable.
