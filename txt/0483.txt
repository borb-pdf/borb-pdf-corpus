          Things to do right at the start
          1.  As soon as you start a business on your own account, you should register  
             as a selfemployed person with the MRA.
          2.  If you have given up your previous employment, you should collect your  
             Statement of Emoluments & Tax Deduction with your previous employer in              
             order to include your employment income in your return at the end of the  
             income year.
          3.  You will have to keep proper records of all your business transactions in  
             order to help you prepare your ifnal accounts.
          4.  If you employ someone in the business, you must register as an employer            
             and may have to deduct income tax under PAYE (Pay As You Earn). (R efer 
             to Guide on PAYE).
          5.  You will have to register for VAT if the taxable supplies you make e  xceed 
             Rs 6m a year. You will then be considered as a VAT registered person and  
             you will have to use VAT invoices only.
          6.  Once a person is registered for VAT, he charges VAT at the rate of 15% on   
             all taxable supplies other than zero-rated supplies made to his customers.
          7.  It is advisable for you to have a separate bank account   for business 
             transactions. If you do not have a bank account, you will ifnd it useful to  
             open one to bank your sales.
          8.  Whether to retain the services of an accountant or not is something you  
             are free to decide by yourself. It is not essential, but it is an advantage            to 
             have a qualiifed professional accountant to advise you on day-to-day  
             book-keeping payment to National Pension Fund, Value Added Tax,  the 
             operation of PAYE, as well as to draw up your accounts.

            Things to do right at the start cont’d
            9.  No matter who prepares your accounts, it is you as a tr                                                                                                             ader who is 
                 responsible for their accuracy and for making currents returns.  The MRA 
                 will need to be satisifed that the accounts submitted repr  esent the true 
                 results of the trading business. If you cannot give to the MRA an accur ate 
                 statement of your turnover and proifts, these will have to be estimated by  
                 the MRA. You will then have to pay tax on the basis of those estima                                                   tes. In 
                 case you consider the estimate to be too high, the burden of proof will lie                                 
                 on you. It is therefore beneifcial for you to keep complete records.
            10. Details of accounts to be inserted while ifling your income tax returns 
                  are ifgures regarding your Trading and Proift & Loss Account.
            11. Even if returns are submitted electronically, ifnal accounts have to be  
                  provided to the MRA on demand.
            Books and Records
            1.  Irrespective of the type and size of your business and whether you ar                                                                                                   e 
                 registered for VAT or not, it is of utmost importance to keep records of your                               
                 business transactions which will help you prepare your ifnal accounts   in 
              the foreseeable future. Receipts payments and e xpenses relating to 
                 the business should be recorded intact.
            2.  ln case you are registered for VAT , you will have to issue VAT invoices in  
                 accordance with the VAT Act and request VAT invoices from your suppliers                                    
                 in order to enable you to claim input tax on your purchases and expenses.
            3.  Businesses are mainly conducted on either cash basis or cr                                                                                edit basis or 
                 both, depending on its working capital management.                                                                                         Therefore, a cash 
                 book and books of credits should be kept.
            4.  When goods are sold on credit to customers, these customers are called  
              debtors. Hence, records are kept for debtors and this will help you  
                 make an exercise called ageing of debtors, and at the same time, to use the                                 
                 closing ifgure in your balance sheet.
            5.  When goods are purchased on credit from suppliers, those suppliers  
                 are called as creditors and they should be recorded properly in your book                                   
                 of accounts because its closing ifgure will be posted in your balance sheet                                 
                 which will have an impact in your net assets value.
                                                                    2
         6.  There are two types of expenses namely business expenses and priva                   te 
            expenses. It is important to keep records separately for both.                     Business 
            expenses recorded in the books are used in the Trading, Proift and loss  
            account. On the other hand, money used fr                                          om the business fund for 
            private use is termed as cash drawings, and it is adjusted to the ifgur                e of 
            net proift in your balance sheet. Furthermore, if you have tak                                en goods 
            from the business for personal consumption, then this will be tr                                eated as 
            Drawings of Goods. Hence, adjustments should be made to both Trading,        
            Proift and Loss account and the balance sheet.
         7.  You should, of course, keep bank statements, cheques stubs and proper  
            cash book. This will help you prepare your bank reconciliation statement  
            and ensure the accuracy of the closing cash and bank balances                   to be 
            posted in your balance sheet.

          Income Tax Proifts
          Two important rules are:
             i.  Capital expenditure is not an allowable deduction in working out the  
                proifts for Income Tax purposes.
             ii.  The only expenses which are deductible are those which are exclusively        
                incurred in the production of gross income.
          Capital Expenditure means money paid for the purchase of a ifxed asset that 
          will be used in the day-to-day running of a business. In other words, it is not 
          purchased for re-sale. 
          Example: Cost of business premises, plant & machinery, vehicles etc.
          Revenue Expenditure are those expenditures incurred to generate revenues. 
          These are also termed as Proift & Loss items.
          Example: Accountancy fees, wages, rent, rates repairs, electricity bills, etc.
          Although cost of business, plant & machinery and vehicles cannot be 
          claimed as a deduction when computing proifts, there are however specials 
          allowances known as capital allowances for these expenditures.
          Assessment, Objection & Appeal
          If you fail to submit your Income Tax return and a copy of your accounts or 
          your VAT Returns on time or if the MRA is not satisifed with your returns, the 
          MRA will make an estimate of your tax liability. When you receive the notice of 
          assessment, you must decide whether to pay or to object to the assessment 
          within 28 days of the date of the notice of the assessment.
          In case you object to the amount of tax assessed, you will have to pay 10% 
          of the tax claimed in the assessment in order for the MRA to consider your 
          objection. The MRA is under an obligation to determine your objection within 
          4 months.
          If you are still dissatisifed with the determination of the objection, you may 
          make representations to the Assessment Review Committee (ARC). And if 
          you are still dissatisifed with the decision of the ARC, you may appeal to the 
          Supreme Court and the Privy Council.
