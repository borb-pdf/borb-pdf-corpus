       >  COMFORT IS KEY
                            Nexura makes your world a comfortable one. The 
                            coolness of a summer breeze or the cosiness of 
                            an extra heat source brings a feeling of well-being 
                            to your living space all year round. Its unobtrusive 
                            yet stylish design with a front panel that radiates 
                            additional heat, its low noise level and reduced air 
                            lfow turn your room into a haven.

        >    HEATING & COOLING IN ONE
             Quiet and discrete, Nexura offers you the best 
             in heating and cooling, in comfort and design. 
             Of course it uses state-of-the-art heat pump 
             technology but its best feature is a hidden one: 
             the front panel heats up to give you that unique 
             feeling of a warm radiator.

                               To add even more comfort on cold days, the aluminum front panel of the 
                               Nexura unit has the capability of warming up, just like a traditional radiator. 
                               The result? A comfortable feeling of warm air that envelopes you. And all you 
                               have to do to activate this unique feature is push the ‘radiant’ button on your 
                               remote control. It’s that easy. Combine this with a  low noise level and reduced 
                               air lfow, and there is nothing to stop you from enjoying the cosy and relaxed 
                               atmosphere of your room.  24 dB

                               The indoor air unit distributes air at the sound of a whisper. The noise 
                               produced amounts to barely 22 dB(A) in cooling and 19 dB(A) in radiant 
                               heat mode. In comparison, the ambient sound in a quiet room amounts 
                               to 40 dB(A) on average.

                               The titanium apatite photocatalytic air purification filter traps microscopic 
                               dust particles in the air, absorbs organic contaminants as bacteria and 
                               viruses and even breaks down odours.
                               > GENTLY WILL DO IT
                               To ensure a harmonized temperature throughout the room, Daikin’s 
                               Nexura vertical auto swing system automatically makes the louvers move 
                               up and down, creating an even distribution of air through the room.
      Now you                                                                                                                                                                            Europe’s

         The look of the Nexura lfoor standing 
         unit is functional yet stylish. Its sleek 
         design and lfowing lines integrate 
         easily with contemporary interiors. 
         Its powerful whisper-quiet operation 
         reaches the temperature that is right 
         for you in no time. The cosy feeling of 
         a comfortably warm radiator that the 
         front panel offers almost makes you 
         wish for winter to last forever.

                                                      Europe is imposing minimum eiffciency requirements for 
                                                      energy related projects.These minimum requirements 
                                                      came into effect on 1 January 2013, and were revised. 
                                                      New, higher targets will be set in 2014.
                                                      Not only does the Eco-Design Directive systematically raise 
                                                      the minimum requirements with respect to environmental 
                                                      performance, the method used to measure this performance 
                                                      has also been changed to better relfect real-life conditions. 
                                                      The seasonal performance rating provides a much more 
                                                      accurate picture of actual expected energy eiffciency over 
                                                      an entire heating or cooling season.
                                                      Completing the picture is an energy label for EU which 
                                                      allows consumers to compare and make purchasing 
                                                      decisions based on uniform labelling criteria. The label 
                                                      includes multiple classiifcations from A+++ to D relfected

                                                      includes not only the new seasonal eiffciency ratings for

                                 To help you sleep more comfortably, Daikin Radiation FVXG’s night set mode 
                                 will prevent overheating or overcooling during the night. If the timer is 
                                 switched on, the unit will automatically set the temperature 2°C cooler when 
                                 warming and 0.5°C warmer when cooling. This prevents rapid changes that 
                                 could disturb your sleep.

                                 The Econo mode reduces power consumption and prevents overloading 
                                 when other household appliances are in use. By activating the Econo mode, 
                                 maximum operating current and energy consumption are reduced by about 
                                 30% during start-up.

              DID YOU KNOW THAT ...
              Air-to-air heat pumps obtain 75% of their output energy from a 
              renewable source: the ambient air, which is both renewable and 
              inexhaustible. Of course, heat pumps also require electricity to 
              run the system, but increasingly this electricity can also be 
              generated from renewable energy sources (solar energy, wind 
              energy, hydropower, biomass). A heat pump’s efficiency is 
              measured in SCOP (Seasonal Coefficient Of Performance) for 
              heating and SEER ( Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) for cooling.
      Daikin has a worldwide reputation based on 90 years’ experience in the successful manufacture of high 
      quality air conditioning equipment for residential, commercial and industrial use and 56 years as a leader 
      in heat pump technology.
