         Sepsis Information Leaﬂet 
         Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by infection 
         that affects the function of the organs. It is treated most 
         effectively if recognised early.
         Signs & symptoms of infection:
         Infections are often suspected when a person develops a 
         temperature and feels unwell. 
         A high temperature is > 38°C. A low temperature, ≤ 35.5°C, is 
         also of concern but do check your technique.
         Watch out for loved ones who have taken paracetamol as while 
         it may lower the temperature it does not treat any underlying 
         infection. Look for the other signs and symptoms of infection 
         listed in the table.
                                These are involuntary movements of the body that look a bit 
          Rigors
                                like seizures but are not associated with loss of consciousness.
                                Rigors occur when the body temperature rapidly changes.
          ‘Flu-like’ illness    Many infections present with non-specific signs and 
                                symptoms including a high temperature, aches and pains, 
                                severe fatigue, and loss of appetite.
