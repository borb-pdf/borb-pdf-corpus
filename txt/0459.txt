                  1.    Introduction 
                        The  Technology  and  Living  /  Home  Economics  special  rooms  are  equipped  with 
                        electrical and gas appliances, sharp tools and different equipment. The proper installation 
                        and regular maintenance are essential for eliminating potential hazards. 
                        Teachers and students are required to pay special attention to safety precautions when 
                        working in these special rooms. The teacher must give a clear lead by his / her own 
                        planning and precepts and by personal examples. They must ensure that their knowledge 
                        is adequate for the detection of dangers e. g. use of chemicals in food and textile science 
                        and be alert to possible hazards. Teachers should also be able to give expert supervision 
                        to guard against any possible danger in the practical areas. Students should be taught 
                        how to work sensibly and to acquire positive attitudes towards the safe practice of the 
                        subject. 
                  2.     Room Organisation 
                         The planning of space and equipping of special rooms for Technology and Living / 
                         Home Economics should be carefully considered. It is at the planning stage that basic 
                         safety measures must be examined. Schools are advised to seek the expert advice from 
                         the Education Bureau or from an architect at the earliest opportunity whenever special 
                         rooms are to be planned or modified. 
                         It is necessary for the school to provide an appropriate and safe learning environment 
                         for  students  in  carrying  out  Technology  and  Living  /  Home  Economics  practical 
                         activities. All practical work should be carried out in the Technology and Living / Home 
                         Economics special rooms (i.e. (i) Technology and Living / Home Economics Room I for 
                         the  Food  Science  and  Technology  Strand  and,  (ii)  Technology  and  Living  /  Home 
                         Economics Room II for the Fashion, Clothing and Textiles Strand) and / or Science 
                         Laboratories  (e.g.  Integrated  Science  Laboratory,  Biology  Laboratory,  Chemistry 
                         Laboratory) meeting the standard requirements of government / aided / private / caput / 
                         direct subsidy schools as laid down by the Education Bureau. The rooms should be fully 
                         equipped  according  to  the  standard  Furniture  and  Equipment  List  provided  by  the 
                         Education  Bureau.  For  schools  with  a  Year  2000  Layout,  the  size  of  a  standard 
                         Technology  and  Living  /  Home  Economics  Room  I  is  145M2  and  the  size  of  the 
                         Technology and Living / Home Economics Room II is    105M2 
                         2.1    The Setting 
                                Good design and layout of a special room will help in providing convenient, safe 
                                                                        1 
                               and efficient working conditions. Ergonomic principles should be applied in the 
                               design and setting of a workstation, such that it matches the characteristics and 
                               limitations  of  the  user.    When  new  rooms  or  alterations  to  existing  rooms  are 
                               being planned, the following factors should be considered: 
                               (a)   The special rooms must be well designed and spacious enough 
                                     –  to allow the safe layout of equipment and furniture with no unnecessary 
                                         protrusions from walls or furniture that may cause obstructions; 
                                     –  to provide good lighting and adequate ventilation; 
                                     –  to provide non-slippery floor; 
                                     –  to allow easy access to all working areas; 
                                     –  to permit effective supervision; 
                                     –  to provide adequate means of escape in case of an emergency; 
                                     –  to include adequate and well-sited storage space for materials, equipment 
                                         and for students' possessions such as school blazer, bags, etc. 
                               (b)   Worktables and movable equipment should be positioned in an organised 
                                     manner with sufficient space in between for students to move about without 
                                     interfering other students' work. 
                               (c)   Electrical equipment should be sited away from water supply e.g. electrical 
                                     cookers should be sited away from sinks. 
                               (d)   The science area must be separated from food preparation and dress / textile 
                                     areas to prevent contamination of food and damage to fabrics. 
                               (e)   If liquefied petroleum gas is used in the special room, formal approval must 
                                     be  obtained  from  the  Director  of  Electrical  and  Mechanical  Services 
                                     Department. All safety requirements formulated for such purpose must be 
                                     observed at all times. 
                        2.2    Equipping and Furnishing 
                               (a)   The dimensions of furniture and fitments should be suited to the age range of 
                                     students to avoid unnecessary bending or stretching. 
                               (b)   Drop leaf or convertible worktables e.g. needlework / dining table, must be 
                                     firmly fixed in position to prevent sudden movement and the trapping of 
                                     fingers or other hazards. 
                               (c)   The sitting of sewing machines must provide adequate space for students as 
                                     users and teachers as supervisors. 
                               (d)   Flammable furniture and furnishing e.g. curtains or blinds should be fitted 
                                     some distance away from cookers and naked flames. 
                                                                     2 
                               (e)   The store cupboard should be so designed that pest has no way of getting in. 
                               (f)   Work surfaces should be of suitable and easily cleaned material to ensure 
                                     cleanliness. There should be no cracks or open joints that might act as dirt 
                                     traps. 
                               (g)   The  floor  surfaces  should  be  of  a  non-slip  type  and  free  from  risks  of 
                                     tripping. 
                               (h)   The main switches for electricity, gas and water supply should be within easy

                                                  -    Wipe the food dry before deep frying or the oil will splash.   
                                                  -    Lower foods into the hot oil gently, do not drop them from high. 
                                                                               8 
                                              Spitting will cause scald. 
                                   (iv)  Microwave Cooking 
                                          To ensure thorough cooking using microwaves, always rotate and stir 
                                          foods to promote more even cooking. Allow foods to stand for a while 
                                          after cooking with microwaves, let the centre of the food cool off a 
                                          little before it can be eaten safely. 
                                   (v)    Reheating 
                                          -   When reheating foods, heat to steaming hot for at least 7 to 10 
                                              minutes. More time is needed in relation to the size of food. 
                                          -   Do not reheat leftover foods. 
                       4.3   Safety Management 
                                      It will be desirable for schools to develop an effective safety management 
                                      system in place (e.g. setting up a standing committee on laboratory and 
                                      special  rooms  safety)  to  monitor  the  standard  of  special  rooms  and 
                                      laboratory safety, to draw up and implement an emergency plan (including 
                                      emergency  measures,  evacuation  procedures  and  escape  routes)  and 
                                      conduct evacuation drills regularly in school. This will ensure that safety 
                                      measures adopted in secondary schools are properly implemented and any 
                                      emergencies occurring in the Technology and Living / Home Economics 
                                      special rooms and laboratories are dealt with in an effective and efficient 
                                      manner. For more details about the composition and duties of the above 
                                      committee please refer to Appendix 3. 
                             4.3.1    Subject Panel Meetings 
                             (a)      Panel Chairperson 
                                      Technology  and  Living  /  Home  Economics  panel  chairpersons  should 
                                      arrange at least two of the panel meetings in each school year to discuss 
                                      matters regarding the Technology and Living / Home Economics special 
                                      rooms  and  laboratory  safety  with  their  members.  The  meetings  on  the 
                                      Technology and Living / Home Economics special room and laboratory 
                                      safety could be conducted in parallel with the meetings of the Standing 
                                      Committee on Laboratory and Special Rooms Safety as mentioned above 
                                                                  9 
                                      to follow up the resolutions passed and to provide feedback to the Standing 
                                      Committee when necessary. 
                              (b)     Panel Members 
                                      The duties of panel members related to special room and laboratory safety 
                                      should be clearly defined. Effective measures should be adopted to ensure 
                                      all panel members provide adequate safety instructions and equipment to 
                                      students so that learning and teaching are conducted in a safe environment. 
                                      Adequate training should be provided to newly appointed teaching staff 
                                      and laboratory staff as well as the student-teachers on teaching practice. 
                              4.3.2   Laboratory and Special Rooms Safety Rules 
                                      To  ensure  laboratory  safety,  each  school  should  formulate  its  own 
                                      laboratory and special rooms safety rules for compliance by students and 
                                      teachers apart from the Technology and Living / Home Economics teachers 
                                      Science teachers and laboratory staff. When formulating such rules, school 
                                      should consider its practical situation and make reference to the guidelines 
                                      given by the Education Bureau and other relevant government departments. 
                                      The  rules  should  be  displayed  conspicuously  in  Home  Economics  / 
                                      Technology and Living special rooms and Science laboratories. 
                              4.3.3   Lessons on Laboratory Safety 
                                      Teachers should spare at least one lesson on teaching the general aspects of 
                                      laboratory safety with each class at the beginning of the school year. They 
                                      should elaborate on the specific aspects of laboratory safety of individual 
                                      experiments whenever appropriate during the normal delivery of science 
                                      lessons. 
                              4.3.4   Safety with Experiments 
                              (a)     Teachers should ensure the safety of all practical activities and must be 
                                      thorough in preparation. Experiments should be arranged in such a way to 
                                      minimise  risks,  for  example,  using  the  minimum  amount  and  lowest 
                                      concentration  of  chemicals,  and  replacing  hazardous  chemicals  or 
                                      dangerous  procedures  with  safer  alternatives  whenever  possible.  Any 
                                      demonstrations or student experiments that are newly conducted should be 
                                      tried  out  before  they  are  performed  in  class  to  avoid  any  unpredictable 
                                                                   10 
                                      mishaps. 
                             (b)      At the beginning of each school term, the Technology and Living / Home 
                                      Economics teachers should liaise with the Science teachers and / or the 
                                      Laboratory Technician(s) concerned regarding preparation for experiments 
                                      to be conducted in the Science Laboratories.    Advance notice and clear 
                                      instructions (preferably in written form) should be given to the laboratory 
                                      staff to facilitate their preparation work. Please refer to Appendix 6 for a 
                                      sample of instruction form. 
                             (c)      Before  each  experiment,  teachers  should  also  give  clear  instructions  to 
                                      students and remind them of the potential hazards, safety precautions to 
                                      take and proper ways to dispose of chemical wastes, etc. As far as possible, 
                                      teachers should note the health conditions of students so that precautions 
                                      can  be  taken  where  appropriate.  Teachers  should  also  give  sufficient 
                                      supervision  and  guidance  to  students  during  experiments.  A  reasonably 
                                      good control of class discipline should always be maintained.   
                             4.3.5    Safety Inspections 
                             (a)      Each  Technology  and  Living  /  Home  Economics  special  room  and 
                                      laboratory should be regularly inspected to ensure that all safety measures 
                                      are in place. If irregularities are spotted during inspections, prompt actions 
                                      should be taken to rectify the situations 
                             (b)      To  facilitate  regular  and  thorough  safety  inspections,  it  is  desirable  to

                                      (d)   The electric  cord  /  flex  must  not  be  replaced  by  the  user,  as  this 
                                            requires  the  use  of  special  tools.  If  the  electric  flex  is  damaged, 
                                            contact the authorized service centre. 
                                      (e)   Keep hands and utensils out of the cylinder bowl while in use to 
                                            reduce the risk of injury to persons or to the appliance itself. DO 
                                            NOT  USE  SHARP  OBJECTS  OR  UTENSILS  INSIDE  THE 
                                            CYLINDER  BOWL!  Sharp  objects  will  scratch  and  damage  the 
                                            inside of the cylinder bowl. A rubber spatula or wooden spoon may 
                                            be used, when the ice cream maker is in the “off” position.   
                                      (f)   Do not operate the ice cream maker with a damaged cord or plug,

                                            surfaces.  Any  servicing  other  than  cleaning  and  user  maintenance 
                                            should be performed by an authorized service center.   
                                      (j)   Never heat  the  ice  cream  container.  The  ice  cream  container  is  a 
                                            sealed vessel. Heating may result in rupture of the vessel and possible 
                                            personal injury.   
                                      Freezing the Cylinder Bowl 
                                      The most important step in making frozen desserts is to make sure that the 
                                      cylinder bowl is properly frozen. The cylinder features a double insulated 
                                                                  19 
                                       bowl and requires thorough freezing. For best results, the cylinder should 
                                       be placed upright in the back of your freezer, where the temperature is 
                                       coldest.  As  there  is  liquid  in  between  the  cylinder  walls,  shake  the 
                                       container to check ideal freezing condition; you should no hear any liquid 
                                       moving within the walls. Make sure that the cylinder bowl is washed and 
                                       thoroughly dried, place in back of freezer or where freezer compartment is 
                                       the coldest. The length of time necessary to properly freeze the cylinder 
                                       bowl (at least 8 hours) will depend upon how cold the freezer temperature 
                                       is.  Continually freezing the cylinder bowl in the freezer allows you the 
                                       flexibility to make your favorite frozen dessert at a moment’s notice. 
                                       Cleaning 
                                       The cylinder bowl, dasher and lid can be cleaned in warm water and mild 
                                       detergent.  Do  not  put  any  parts  in  the  dishwasher.  The  motor  can  be 
                                       cleaned by using a damp cloth. Never immerse the motor unit in water. 
                                       Make sure all  parts  are  dried  thoroughly  and  never  replace  cylinder  in 
                                       freeze if it is still wet. Never store the dasher or drive shaft in the freezer.

                        5.13  Disposal of Waste 
                               In managing waste in the Technology and Living / Home Economics room, the 
                               Waste  Reduction  Practices:  Waste  Avoidance,  Waste  Minimisation  and  Waste 
                               Recovery, Reuse and Recycling should always be practised. 
                               5.13.1  Food Waste 
                                       (a)    Try  to  reduce  the  amount  of  food  waste.  Teachers  are  advised  to 
                                              order the quantity of food required precisely minimising surplus and 
                                              to pack away or consume all the cooked food as far as possible. 
                                       (b)    To avoid unnecessary waste, students are advised to bring their own 
                                                                     29 
                                              bags when purchasing foods, and if packaging is needed, only the 
                                              essential is used. 
                                       (c)    Keep waste food separate from dry, non-food waste materials. 
                                       (d)    Wrap all food waste in used paper before disposing in refuse bins. 
                                       (e)    Use refuse bins that are easy to clean, fitted with a lid and should 
                                              preferably be foot-operated. 
                                       (f)    Line waste bin with a polythene bag of suitable size. Use a new liner 
                                              bag every time the bin is emptied and cleaned. 
                                       (g)    Keep the refuse bin clean especially the lid. Wash and dry the bin 
                                              regularly and thoroughly. 
                                       (h)    Never allow food waste to accumulate in special rooms or be left 
                                              overnight.  Pests  will  eat  and  spoil  food;  they  will  also  carry  and 
                                              spread bacteria causing food poisoning. 
                               5.13.2  Domestic Waste

                                              should not be used for experiments. 
                                       (c)    Never touch broken glasses with one's hands. Pick up large pieces 
                                              using tongs. Sweep away the small broken pieces. 
                                       (d)    Broken pieces of glass should be disposed of properly in a metal or 
                                              plastic container assigned for such purpose and never into a general 
                                              rubbish container. 
                                       (e)    Wrap broken glass, knives and needles thickly with paper and label 
                                              them before disposing. 
                               5.13.4  Waste Oil 
                                       Pour cold waste oil into thick polythene bag lined with thick newspaper. 
                                       Tie up tightly and dispose with ordinary waste. 
                               5.13.5  Aerosol Cans 
                                       (a)    Do not pierce or incinerate.

                                      or mild grade chemicals are used. Household chemicals such as detergents, 
                                      cleaning agents, and bleaches can be diluted and disposed through the sinks. 
                                      Other chemicals used in food or textile experimental work must be treated 
                                      properly. Technology and Living / Home Economics teachers are advised 
                                      to contact the science teachers, laboratory technician or science department 
                                      of  the  school  before  disposing  such  chemicals.  For  details  on  the 
                                      procedures of handling chemical waste, please refer to the "Handbook on

                                      hazards. It is important to foresee the potential hazards in each case and to 
                                      take the proper precautions. 
                                                                  31 
                             (d)      Wash  hands  after  experiments,  especially  those  involving  the  use  of 
                                      chemicals, living organisms and radioactive substances. 
                             (e)      To  avoid  the  possibility  of  allergy,  extra  care  should  be  taken  when 
                                      handling pollen and fur. 
                             (f)      Pipette fillers should be used to help transfer liquid chemicals. 
                             (g)      Needle should not be provided for the syringe. The liquid content may 
                                      squirt  into  eyes  if  excessive  pressure  is  exerted  on  the  plunger  of  the 
                                      syringe. 
                             (h)      Heavy  objects  should  be  lifted  with  correct  posture.  Ask  others  for 
                                      assistance whenever necessary. When carrying heavy objects, especially 
                                      large bottles containing dangerous substances, appropriate carrier or trolley 
                                      should be used as far as possible. 
                             (i)      Appropriate safety facilities and personal protective equipment should be 
                                      used whenever necessary. 
                       6.3   Personal Protective Equipment 
                             Students, teachers and laboratory staff, when working in the laboratory, should 
                             wear suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) in all circumstances wherever 
                             there  is  any  potential  risk  of  bodily  injury.  All  PPE  should  be  kept  clean  and 
                             properly maintained in a serviceable condition. Defective PPE should be replaced 
                             immediately. 
                             6.3.1    Safety Spectacles 
                                      (a)   Each laboratory should be equipped with enough safety spectacles for 
                                            use  by  every  student.  Safety  spectacles  must  be  put  on  when 
                                            conducting experiment involving heating chemicals, handling acids, 
                                            alkalis and other corrosive chemicals, working with glass apparatus 
                                            under  pressure,  carrying  out  potentially  violent  or  exothermic 
                                            reactions, or when there is any potential risk of eye injury. Whenever 
                                            safety spectacles are required, they should be continually worn by all 
                                            until everyone has finished the relevant activity. 
                                      (b)   Scratched or defective safety spectacles should be replaced without 
                                            delay because they may affect visibility and cause strain to the eyes 
                                            or fail to serve their protective purpose. Dirty safety spectacles should 
                                            be cleaned with detergent or disinfectant (e.g. Savlon) as appropriate.   
                                                                  32 
                            6.3.2   Protective Gloves and Laboratory Gown 
                                    Appropriate protective gloves should be worn for hand protection while 
                                    handling corrosive chemicals, hot objects, microorganisms, etc. Laboratory 
                                    gown should be worn for body protection whenever necessary. However, 
                                    torn or ragged clothing can be dangerous instead of protective. 
                      6.4   Using Air-conditioners in Laboratories / Laboratory Preparation Rooms 
                            (a)     If  schools  have  installed  air-conditioners  in  their  science  laboratories  / 
                                    laboratory preparation rooms, all users of these special rooms including 
                                    students,  teachers,  and  laboratory  staff  should  take  appropriate  safety 
                                    measures to ensure that there is adequate ventilation in the rooms during 
                                    practical activities. 
                            (b)     When Bunsen burners or chemicals are to be used, all air-conditioners 
                                    should be switched off and exhaust fans switched on. The windows of 
                                    these laboratories should be left open. Notices to this effect should be 
                                    conspicuously displayed in these laboratories.   
                            (c)     To maintain adequate fresh air supply in laboratory preparation room, the 
                                    exhaust fan must be switched on whenever the room is in use. To this 
                                    effect,  the  air-conditioning  system  and  exhaust  fan  in  the  preparation 
                                    rooms must be electrically interlocked so that switching on of the former 
                                    will automatically turn on the ventilation fan so as to avoid accumulation 
                                    of gases within the preparation room, but not vice versa.   
                            (d)     Chemicals which generate hazardous vapours should not be handled or 
                                    stored  inside  preparation  rooms,  whether  or  not  air-conditioned. 
                                    Preparation work which involves unpleasant or hazardous vapours / gases 
                                    should not be conducted in preparation rooms but in fume cupboards of the 
                                    laboratories. 
                      6.5   Chemical Spills 
                            Schools  should  have  effective  emergency  measures  to  deal  with  spillage  of 
                            chemicals. Laboratory staff should be well prepared to handle small-scale spillages 
                            that  are  likely  to  occur  in  school  laboratories.  Methods  of  safe  handling  of 
                            chemicals and dealing with spillages are usually provided in Material Safety Data 
                            Sheets. Adequate safety equipment (e.g. spill control kits and barrier tape, etc.) 
                            and personal protective equipment (e.g. protective gloves, respirator and safety 
                                                                33 
                            goggles, etc.) should be readily available for use in handling chemical spills. All 
                            students and untrained personnel should be kept away from the immediate area of 
                            spill. 
                      6.6   Handling Glassware 
                            (a)     Large glass bottles should not be lifted or carried by the neck, nor cradled 
                                    in the arms. The main body of the bottle should be grasped firmly, and 
                                    trolleys or special carriers should be used.   
                            (b)     When a tight glass-stoppered bottle is opened, the bottle should be placed 
                                    in a trough large enough to hold the contents in case of accidental spillage 
                                    and the stopper gently tapped. Brief gentle warming of the neck of the 
                                    bottle can help if appropriate. 
                            (c)     The fitting of a pipette filler to a pipette should be done gently. During the 
                                    process, the pipette should be held at the upper stem to avoid accidental 
                                    breakage. 
                            (d)     When glass tubing and rods are being cut, hands should be protected with a 
                                    piece of cloth when “snapping” the cut. The sharp ends of glass tubing 
                                    should always be polished in a flame.   
                            (e)     When inserting glass tubing into a cork or rubber bung,   
                                    (i)     the tubing should not be pointed towards the palm of the hand;   
                                    (ii)    the size of the hole should be compatible with the size of the tubing 
                                            and a lubricant should be used; and   
                                    (iii)   a cork borer can be used to assist the threading of tubing through the 
                                            hole of a rubber bung. 
                                    It  is  always  better  to  sacrifice  a  cork  by  cutting  it  than  to  struggle  to 
                                    remove stuck glass tubing. 
                            (f)     Glass tubing should be stored vertically, whenever possible. If a horizontal 
                                    rack is used, the tubing should not protrude beyond the end of the rack. 
                      6.7   Safe Use of Gas 
                            6.7.1   Gas Supply 
                                    (a)      Schools  should  never  attempt  to  carry  out  installation  or  repair 
                                             work on fixed gas pipework or appliances. By law, such work must 
                                             only be undertaken by registered gas installers (RGIs) employed by 
                                                                34 
                                              contractors registered with the government. 
                                      (b)     If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is used in the laboratory, formal 
                                              approval must be obtained from the Director of Fire Services and 
                                              all fire services requirements formulated for such purpose must be 
                                              observed at all times. 
                                      (c)     The Gas Authority strongly  recommends on safety  grounds that 
                                              LPG  cylinders  should  not  be  stored  inside  school  science 
                                              laboratories. For schools in locations where a piped gas supply is 
                                              not  available,  LPG  cylinders  should  be  housed  in  an  approved 
                                              chamber external to school premises (i.e. within the entire school 
                                              boundary but outside the school building) with the gas supply piped 
                                              into  the  laboratories.  If  schools  have  any  enquiries  about  these 
                                              recommendations,  please  contact  the  Electrical  and  Mechanical 
                                              Services Department at 2882 8011. 
                                      (d)     LPG cylinders must not be used in any locations below ground 
                                              level where natural ventilation is not possible. 
                             6.7.2    Ventilation 
                                      (a)     Make sure that ventilation in the room is adequate when Bunsen 
                                              burners or gas appliances are to be used. 
                                      (b)     In laboratories and preparation rooms where air-conditioners 
                                              are  installed,  all  air-conditioners  should  be  switched  off  and 
                                              exhaust fans switched on when doing experiments. All windows 
                                              of these rooms should also be left open. 
                             6.7.3    Gas Burners 
                                      (a)     The main gas supply valve of the laboratory should only be turned 
                                              on when gas supply is required, and all downstream gas taps inside 
                                              the laboratory must be in the OFF position before the main valve is 
                                              turned on. 
                                      (b)     Gas taps with safety locks are recommended. Older type of gas taps 
                                              without safety lock tend to loosen with constant use, and should be 
                                              checked from time to time and replaced when necessary 
                                      (c)     The rubber tubings connecting gas taps to Bunsen burners should 
                                              be of a type suitable for use with the gas being supplied and should 
                                                                  35 
                                              be obtained from the gas supplier. Both ends of the tubings should 
                                              be held in position by hose clips to prevent loosening. They should 
                                              be regularly inspected for defects and replaced at least every three 
                                              years. 
                                      (d)     All unused gas taps should be properly secured to prevent them 
                                              from being mistakenly turned on by students. All gas taps should be 
                                              turned off after experiments have been completed. 
                             6.7.4    Contingency Measures in Case of Gas Leakage 
                                      (a)     The location of the main gas supply valve to each laboratory (with 
                                              ON / OFF positions clearly marked) should be made known so that 
                                              it can be turned off when the laboratory is to be unattended for an 
                                              extended period of time or in an emergency. 
                                      (b)     If a gas leak is discovered or suspected, 
                                               (i)  all gas supply taps including the main valve to the laboratory 
                                                    should be turned off; 
                                              (ii)  all windows / doors should be opened wide; 
                                              (iii)  students should be evacuated from the laboratory area; 
                                              (iv)  electrical switches must not be operated; and 
                                              (v)   all naked flames should be extinguished. 
                                      (c)     The gas leak should be reported urgently in accordance with the 
                                              established procedures. 
                                      (d)     The main gas supply valve must not be turned on again until the gas 
                                              leak inside the laboratory has been located and repaired by an RGI. 
                                              However, when gas continues to escape into the laboratory after the 
                                              main supply has been turned off, or when a smell of gas persists, 
                                              then  the  Fire  Services  Department  and  the  gas  supply  company 
                                              must  be  contacted  immediately  in  accordance  with  school 
                                              emergency procedures. 
                                      (e)     As LPG is heavier than air, leaked LPG tends to accumulate at low 
                                              level. It will not dissipate easily unless there is plenty of ventilation 
                                              at low level. In the case of Towngas, it is lighter than air and can be 
                                              cleared by opening windows wide. 
                                                                  36 
                      6.8   Involving Students as the Subjects in Experiments 
                            6.8.1   Handling Spillage of Samples 
                                    Any spillage of samples should be cleaned up with disposable absorbent 
                                    materials immediately. The spill site should then be wiped off with cloth or 
                                    paper towels soaked in disinfectant (e.g. hypochlorite) and then the cloth or 
                                    paper towels should be placed in double sealed plastic bags for disposal. In 
                                    case the skin is in contact with the spillage, wash with liquid soap and 
                                    water immediately and thoroughly 
                            6.8.2   Disinfection after Practical Work 
                                    After practical work, all instruments should be immersed in disinfectant for 
                                    an appropriate period of time. If they can tolerate heat, they can be boiled 
                                    for 5 minutes for disinfection, or sterilised by steam under pressure. The 
                                    bench  surface  should  also  be  washed  with  disinfectant.  Wash  hands 
                                    thoroughly with liquid soap and water 
                            6.8.3   Smelling and Tasting Substances 
                                    In  experiments  involving  smelling  of  chemicals,  students  should  be 
                                    reminded  of  smelling  only  very  small  quantities  of  the  chemicals  by 
                                    fanning  gently  towards  the  nose.  Experiments  have  to  be  performed  in 
                                    well-ventilated  areas.  Tasting  should  not  be  carried  out  in  laboratories 
                                    except  for  experimental  purpose.  For  experiments  involving  tasting  and 
                                    smelling items other than chemicals, substances known to be harmless and 
                                    free from contamination should be used. Substances containing irritants or 
                                    having allergic effect should not be used.

                7.    Outdoor / Fieldwork Activities 
                      Schools should note that outdoor / fieldwork activities must be under the supervision of 
                      responsible school staff. Under normal circumstances, a ratio of one staff member to a 
                      group of 30 (or below) students is recommended. The school should inform the police 
                      and students’ parents / guardians of the route of the trip and the due time of return. Prior 
                      written consent from parents / guardians for students taking part in outdoor / fieldwork 
                      activities must be obtained. (Please refer to the Guidelines on Outdoor Activities issued 
                                                                37

                         Laboratories 
                         Regulation 55(2) of the ducation  Regulations  states  that  at  least  2  teachers  in  every 
                         school shall be trained in administering first aid. Teachers and school staff qualified in 
                         administering first aid should be in a better position to render valuable assistance in the 
                         event of emergencies and accidents. School principals should encourage their science 
                         staff and students to undergo some form of training in first aid. These training courses 
                         can be obtained from Hong Kong Red Cross, Hong Kong St John Ambulance, Scout 
                         Association, Girl Guides Association, etc. 
                         In the event of any serious injury, or whenever in doubt, medical aid should be sought 
                         without delay. Schools can call an ambulance to send the patient(s) to hospital. 

                                In case of accidents, the teacher concerned should note and report the case to the 
                                school management for all necessary and follow up actions as laid down by the 
                                school and the Education Bureau. The wounded person should be examined by 
                                qualified professionals.   
                                8.1.1    Fainting 
                                         A certain degree of faintness or dizziness may result from any accident, 
                                         and the following measures should be taken: 
                                         (a)      Ensure the patient's air passages remain open and clear and that he 
                                                  or  she  is  breathing  adequately.  Loosen  any  tight  clothing.  If 
                                                  breathing  and  pulse  stop,  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  must  be 
                                                  applied immediately and call an ambulance at the same time. 
                                         (b)      Observe the level of responsiveness based upon eye opening, verbal 
                                                  and  motor  responses.  Note  any  changes  in  the  state  of 
                                                  unconsciousness.

                                         (f)      Place the patient in the recovery position. 
                                                                        38 
                                      (g)     Cover the patient with a blanket.   
                                      (h)     If  the  patient recovers consciousness, reassure and observe him / 
                                              her. Advise him / her to see a doctor. 
                                      (i)     Do not give anything to an unconscious patient by mouth. 
                             8.1.2  Electrical Injury 
                                      (a)     Under safe circumstances, switch off the power supply, and remove 
                                              him / her from contact with the electrical source. Never touch the 
                                              patient with bare hands until you are sure that he / she is no longer 
                                              in  contact  with  the  source.  If  you  cannot  break  the  current 
                                              immediately,  stand  on  some  dry  insulating  materials,  such  as  a 
                                              wooden box and remove the patient from the source with other dry 
                                              insulating objects. 
                                      (b)     Check the point of contact on the body for burn, which may be 
                                              severe.  Place  a  sterile  dressing  over  the  burn  and  secure  with  a 
                                              bandage. Seek medical treatment. 
                                      (c)     It  is  essential  that  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  must  be  started 
                                              immediately  if  the  shock  has  produced  respiratory  and  cardiac 
                                              arrest.   
                             8.1.3    Heat Burns and Scalds 
                                      (a)     Place the affected area under slowly running cold water until the 
                                              pain fades. 
                                      (b)     Remove  any  rings,  watches,  belts,  shoes  or  other  constricting 
                                              clothing from the injured area before it starts to swell, but do not 
                                              remove any clothing adhering to the burn. 
                                      (c)     Do  not  apply  lotions,  ointments  or  any  other  chemicals  to  the 
                                              injured area.   
                                      (d)     Do not break blisters or remove any loose skin. 
                                      (e)     Cover the affected area with a dry, sterile dressing / gauze and then 
                                              secure with bandage. Never use adhesive dressing. 
                                      (f)     As far as possible, immobilise the affected part so as to minimise 
                                              pain. 
                                      (g)     For severe burns, medical aid should be sought without delay. 
                             8.1.4    Chemical Burns 
                                      When handling chemical burns, only water should be used for first-aid 
                                                                  39

                                       (a)      Place the affected area under slowly running cold water until the 
                                                pain fades. 
                                       (b)      Remove  any  contaminated  clothing  carefully,  but  avoid  making 
                                                contact with the chemical yourself. 
                                       (c)      For severe burns, medical aid should be sought without delay. It is 
                                                essential that flooding of the affected area has to be continued all 
                                                the  while  when  an  ambulance  is  being  summoned  to  send  the 
                                                patient to hospital for treatment. A sample of the chemical or the 
                                                name and composition of the chemical should also be taken to the 
                                                hospital for reference or identification. 
                               8.1.5   Eye Injuries 
                                       (a)      All eye injuries should be regarded as serious cases and medical 
                                                treatment should be sought without delay. 
                                       (b)      If chemical has entered into the eye, flush the eye with running cold 
                                                water or using eye wash unit immediately for at least 10 minutes. 
                                                Ensure that water drains away from his / her face and not into the 
                                                other eye. Do not attempt to neutralise the chemical in the injured 
                                                eye by acid or alkali. Advise the patient not to rub his / her eye. 
                                       (c)      Do not attempt to remove foreign objects such as glass pieces from 
                                                the eye. Keep the patient still and send for medical aid immediately. 
                                       (d)      Cover the eye with a sterile eye pad.

                                       (a)      Avoid  touching  the  wounds  with  bare  hands  or  having  direct 
                                                contact with blood. Always use a pair of disposable plastic / vinyl 
                                                gloves.   
                                       (b)      Protect the wound with a sterile swab. Clean the areas around the 
                                                wounds with water using liquid soap if necessary. Take care not to 
                                                wipe off any blood clots. 
                                       (c)      If  bleeding persists, apply direct pressure. Apply proper dressing 
                                                after bleeding has stopped. 
                                       (d)      In serious cases, the patient should lie down with the injured part 
                                                raised. Apply direct pressure to the wound over a clean dressing. If 
                                                bleeding continues, do not remove the dressing, but apply further 
                                                pads on top of the original one. Then bandage the wound firmly. 
                                                                     40 
                                                Excessive blood loss may lead to shock. Medical assistance should 
                                                be summoned immediately. 
                                       (e)      Blood-contaminated materials should be properly handled and the 
                                                following precautionary measures need to be taken. 
                                                (i)   Avoid touching blood-contaminated materials with bare hands. 
                                                      Always use a pair of disposable plastic / vinyl gloves. 
                                                (ii)  Use household bleach (diluted with water in the proportion of 
                                                      1:5) to clean up the contaminated areas. 
                                                (iii)  Blood-soiled  gloves,  dressings  and  swabs,  etc.  should  be 
                                                      placed in double plastic bags and then sealed for disposal. 
                               8.1.7  Chemicals Swallowed 
                                       (a)      If the chemical has not been swallowed, ask the patient to spit it out 
                                                and wash the mouth with plenty of water. 
                                       (b)      If the chemical has been swallowed, give the patient plenty of water 
                                                or  milk  to  drink.  Medical  assistance  should  be  summoned 
                                                immediately. 
                                       (c)      If medical consultation has to be sought, a sample of the swallowed 
                                                poison or vomit should be sent along to hospital for identification. 
                               8.1.8   Inhalation of Toxic Gases 
                                       (a)      Open any doors and windows. Remove the patient to a safe place 
                                                without endangering yourself 
                                       (b)      Check his airway and ensure it is not blocked. 
                                       (c)      Place him in the recovery position even if he is conscious. This 
                                                allows him to aspirate even if he vomits. 
                                       (d)      If the patient's breathing stops, carry out artificial respiration. If the 
                                                pulse also stops, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
                                       (e)      Seek medical aid immediately. 
                        8.2    Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
                               If  injury  results  in  unconsciousness  and  that  breathing  and  pulsation  stop, 
                               cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be carried out. First-aid treatment should be 
                               given without delay, otherwise the brain cells will be damaged within 3-4 minutes. 
                               Cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  includes  artificial               respiration    and     chest 
                               compression.  The  following  are  descriptions  on  artificial  respiration  and  chest 
                                                                     41 
                            compression. They should not be regarded as a substitute of the training offered by 
                            first-aid organisations. These procedures should be conducted by persons qualified 
                            in administering first aid.   
                            8.2.1   Artificial Respiration 
                                    Artificial respiration involves the direct blowing of air into the patient's 
                                    lungs to help the restoration of normal breathing.   
                                    (a)      Lay the patient on his back. 
                                    (b)      Check the airway and ensure it is free from obstruction. 
                                    (c)      Head tilt-chin lift and check breathing. 
                                    (d)      Breathe in deeply. Open your mouth wide and make an airtight seal 
                                             over the mouth of the patient, meanwhile, pinch his nostrils with 
                                             your fingers. Then blow gently. (If the patient's mouth is injured, 
                                             your mouth should seal over his nose.) 
                                    (e)      During blowing, watch for chest expansion. 
                                    (f)      If the patient's chest does not rise, check that his mouth and throat 
                                             are clear of any obstruction. 
                                    (g)      After blowing air into his lungs twice, check for pulse. 
                                    (h)      If a pulse is felt, continue to give inflation at a rate of 12-16 times 
                                             per minute until natural breathing is restored. 
                                    (i)      If the pulse stops, carry out chest compression. 
                            8.2.2   Chest Compression 
                                    If  the patient's heart stops when artificial respiration is being conducted, 
                                    chest  compression  should  also  be  carried  out  for  maintaining  blood 
                                    circulation. 
                                    (a)      Place  the  heel  of  one  hand  on  the  lower  half  of  the  patient's 
                                             breastbone. 
                                    (b)      Cover this hand with the heel of the other hand and interlock your 
                                             fingers. 
                                    (c)      Keeping  your  arms  straight,  press  down  about  4-5  cm  and  then 
                                             release. 
                                    (d)      Continue to press 15 times at a rate of 80 times per minute. 
                                    During the process of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial respiration 
                                    and chest compression should be carried out alternatively. If there is only 
                                                                42 
                                    one first aider, the ratio of chest compression and artificial respiration is 
                                    15:2 (If there are two first aiders, the ratio is 5:1). Always check if there is 
                                    any  sign  of  return  in  breathing  and  pulse.  If  the  pulse  returns,  chest 
                                    compression should be discontinued. However, artificial respiration should 
                                    be continued until natural breathing is restored. 
                            8.2.3   Recovery Position 
                                    If the patient loses consciousness but his breathing and pulsation continue, 
                                    place him in the recovery position. Such position enables him to vomit 
                                    freely from his mouth.

                  9.    Prevention of Fire 
                         (a)    Every Technology and Living / Home Economics room must be equipped with at 
                                least two kinds of fire fighting equipment: e.g. 
                                 (i)     At least one carbon dioxide type fire extinguishers; 
                                 (ii)    A fire blanket (Asbestos fire blankets should not be used. They should be 
                                         replaced by fibre glass or other substitutes approved by the Fire Services 
                                         Department) or   
                                 (iii)   A bucket of sand. 
                         (b)    All Technology and Living / Home Economics teachers should be familiar with 
                                the route to escape in case of fire outbreak. They should also know how to operate 
                                and handle all firefighting equipment: 
                                (i)      Keep the fire extinguishers and the bucket of sand inside the special room 
                                         as near to the entrance as possible. 
                                (ii)     Inspect the fire extinguishers at least once in every 12months. 
                                (iii)    Recharge expired or discharged fire extinguishers promptly by a registered 
                                         fire service installation contractor. 
                         (c)    All teachers should be familiar with how to deal with the following: 
                                (i)      When a hot pan or wok catches fire, immediately turn off the heat and 
                                         cover the pan with a lid or the wok with a wok cover. 
                                (ii)     When one's clothes is on fire, lie down immediately to prevent flames from 
                                         hurting one's face. Roll on the floor. 
                                (iii)    When there is an outbreak of fire, lifts must not be used. 
                                (iv)     When the room becomes filled with smoke, cover nose, mouth with a damp 
                                         towel, and escape by crawling on the floor. 
                         (d)    Note the procedures to take in case of fire outbreak: 
                                All available staff should make use of all fire exists to evacuate the students from 
                                the special rooms immediately. If the situation becomes serious, all the students 
                                should  be  evacuated  from  the  school  building.  It  is  essential  that  any  such 
                                evacuation should be carried out in an orderly, controlled manner and that every 
                                effort should be made to avoid panic amongst students. 
                         (e)    The Fire Services Department should be quickly notified by dialing 999. 
                                                                        44 
                          (f)    The  Education  Bureau  should  also  be  notified  of  the  incident.  (Rules  for 
                                 procedures to be followed in case of fire and the escape routes to take should be 
                                 prominently displayed in the special rooms.) 
                   10.  Accident Records 
                          (a)    When an accident involving bodily injuries occurs in the Technology and Living / 
                                 Home  Economics  rooms,  first  aid  should  be  administered  to  the  injured  as 
                                 appropriate, and the school head should be notified as soon as possible. 
                          (b)    In the event of any serious injury, or whenever in doubt, medical aid should be 
                                 sought without delay. The most effective way of securing medical aid urgently is 
                                 to make a 999 telephone call for an ambulance. All injuries to the eyes should be 
                                 regarded as serious. 
                          (c)    A  careful  record  of  all  accidents  (including  minor  accidents)  that  occur  in 
                                 Technology and Living / Home Economics lessons are to be kept by the Panel 
                                 Chairperson. Each entry is recommended to contain: 
                                (i)        Names of persons involved(teachers / students)

             Standing Committee on Laboratory and Special Rooms Safety 
                The following guidelines on setting up a standing committee on laboratory safety are by 
                no means prescriptive and exhaustive. It is the responsibility of each school to formulate 
                proper emergency measures in the light of its practical situation. In order to have better 
                co-ordination of safety work in school, schools may group the Standing Committee with 
                other related safety management groups, like Safety Management Committee and Fire 
                Drills Group. 
                     The Standing Committee on Laboratory Safety should be headed by a laboratory 
                     safety coordinator chosen from among the science teachers. The membership should 
                     comprise all science teachers and laboratory technicians. 
                     The duties of the Standing Committee are as follows: 
                     –      convene regularly to discuss various issues related to laboratory safety such 
                            as the formulation or revision of laboratory safety policies and laboratory 
                            rules,  the  evaluation  of  laboratory  accidents  occurred  and  preventive 
                            measures that can be taken; 
                     –      plan and conduct laboratory safety training programmes regularly for school 
                            staff and students; 
                     –      carry  out  safety  inspections  regularly  on  the  storage  of  chemicals, 
                            maintenance  of  fire-fighting  equipment,  personal  protective  equipment, 
                            first-aid boxes, fume cupboards, laboratory ventilation, etc., and to rectify 
                            any irregularities spotted; 
                     –      formulate,  implement  and  revise  the  emergency  plan  for  dealing  with 
                            emergency cases; and   
                     –      conduct evacuation drills regularly. 
                             A deputy laboratory safety coordinator should also be appointed and take 
                             charge of the duties of the laboratory safety coordinator in the absence of 
                             the latter. 
             It is important that minutes of meetings of the Standing Committee on Laboratory Safety be 
             properly kept and made available for inspection when required.

             Appendix 4       OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH IN SCHOOLS 
             With effect from May 1997, the safety and health of employees in schools is protected by the 
             Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Ordinance  and  its  subsidiary  Regulation.  It  is  the 
             responsibility of employers to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the safety and health of 
             all employees at work. Employees should, as far as reasonably practicable, cooperate with 
             their employers to comply with the requirements of the law so as to protect the safety and 
             health of themselves and any other persons that may be affected. 
             To successfully manage safety and health at work, the Labour Department has advised every 
             school to establish an occupational safety and health management system which includes the 
             following elements : 
             (a)   a safety and health policy statement to show the management's commitment; 
             (b)   organisation structure of the management system, with a clear allocation of safety 
                   responsibilities; 
             (c)   an assessment of the safety and health risks which should be updated when situations 
                   change; 
             (d)   safety and health regulations to be observed in the workplace; 
             (e)   education, instruction and training on occupational safety and health; emergency plans, 
                   drills and first aid arrangements,   
             (f)   a regular review of the system to ensure its effectiveness; and   
             (g)   documentation to keep proper record and ensure continuity of activities. 
             The Education Bureau has advised all secondary schools to set up a standing committee on 
             laboratory  safety  (SCLS).  The  SCLS  can  help  promote  the  standard  of  laboratory  safety 
             through  closer  coordination  and  better  equip  schools  to  deal  with  emergency  situations. 
             Though SCLS is rather similar to the above system, schools should actively review their 
             safety  management  systems  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  of  Occupational  Safety  and 
             Health Ordinance are also observed to protect the safety and health of their employees at 
             work. 
             Further information about the subject or assistance can be obtained from the Occupational 
             Safety and Health Branch of the Labour Department (Tel: 2559 2297) or on the Internet web

                     This safety checklist is intended for use by laboratory staff in secondary schools. It facilitates 
                     the  maintenance  of  the  safety  standard  of  secondary  school  science  laboratories.  This 
                     checklist is by no means exhaustive. Schools may modify the checklist in accordance with the 
                     needs and conditions of their school laboratories.
