          Why we are proposing this strategy 
          This strategy draws on lessons from other 
          countries and identiifes some of the key 
          approaches that have enabled stronger 
          productivity and more balanced growth  
          in other economies. 
     11  Building our Industrial Strategy
     The pillars
     1.  Investing in science, research and innovation – we must become a more innovative 
       economy and do more to commercialise our world leading science base to drive growth across 
       the UK.
     2.  Developing skills – we must help people and businesses to thrive by: ensuring everyone has 
       the basic skills needed in a modern economy; building a new system of technical education 
       to beneift the half of young people who do not go to university; boosting STEM (science, 
       technology, engineering and maths) skills, digital skills and numeracy; and by raising skill levels 
       in lagging areas.
     3.  Upgrading infrastructure – we must upgrade our standards of performance on digital, 
       energy, transport, water and lfood defence infrastructure, and better align central government 
       infrastructure investment with local growth priorities.
     4.  Supporting businesses to start and grow – we must ensure that businesses across the UK 
       can access the ifnance and management skills they need to grow; and we must create the right 
       conditions for companies to invest for the long term.
     5.  Improving procurement – we must use strategic government procurement to drive innovation 
       and enable the development of UK supply chains. 
     6.  Encouraging trade and inward investment – government policy can help boost productivity 
       and growth across our economy, including by increasing competition and helping to bring new 
       ways of doing things to the UK. 
     7.  Delivering affordable energy and clean growth – we need to keep costs down for 
       businesses, and secure the economic beneifts of the transition to a low-carbon economy.
     8.  Cultivating world-leading sectors – we must build on our areas of competitive advantage, 
       and help new sectors to lfourish, in many cases challenging existing institutions and 
       incumbents.
     9.  Driving growth across the whole country – we will create a framework to build on the 
       particular strengths of different places and address factors that hold places back – whether it is 
       investing in key infrastructure projects to encourage growth, increasing skill levels, or backing 
       local innovation strengths.
     10. Creating the right institutions to bring together sectors and places – we will consider the 
       best structures to support people, industries and places. In some places and sectors there may 
       be missing institutions which we could create, or existing ones we could strengthen, be they 
       local civic or educational institutions, trade associations or ifnancial networks.

         These pillars all reinforce one another.                If we want to see faster growth in wages, 
         An economy with more innovative start-ups               sustained over the long term and experienced 
         will require more highly skilled people, more           across the country, the UK needs to address

         Inward investment can drive productivity                countries. While the proportion of people in

           This has been driven by factors such as a 
           lack of clear long-term plans and budgets, a 
           complex planning system, and failure to align 
           planning for infrastructure with planning for 
           housing and industry. We need to upgrade 
           our energy, transport, water, lfood defence 
           and digital infrastructure across the country.
           This will ensure that our businesses can

          Government trade and inward investment 
          policies can open up markets for UK ifrms 
          and bring in income. Measures to support 
          trade and investment can have a crucial 
          impact on long-term growth; not only do 
          they bring in money, trade and investment, 
          but also bring new ideas and approaches, 
          increasing competition and growth.               The Government is working to support

            Questions for consultation
            1.  Does this document identity the right areas of focus: extending our strengths;  
               closing the gaps; and making the UK one of the most competitive places to start                                                                                
               or grow a business? 
            2.  Are the 10 pillars suggested the right ones to tackle low productivity and unbalanced 
               growth? If not, which areas are missing? 
            3.  Are the right central government and local institutions in place to deliver an effective 
               industrial strategy? If not, how should they be reformed? Ar                               e the types of measures 
               to strengthen local institutions set out here and below the right ones?
            4.  Are there important lessons we can learn from the industrial policies of other countries 
               which are not relfected in these ten pillars?

                         Investing in science, research and innovation
             Actions under way:
             •   We are increasing research and development investment by £4.7 billion in total, an 
                 extra £2 billion per year by 2020-21. 
             •   We are creating a new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to help the UK capitalise on 
                 its strengths in science and innovation such as robotics, clean energy and biotechnology. 
             •   We have committed new investment for R&D facilities and knowledge sharing with 
                 £100 million until 2020-21 to extend and enhance the Biomedical Catalyst and a further 
                 £100 million until 2020-21 to incentivise universities to collaborate on technology transfer 
                 and partnering with business.
             •   We have announced that we will be supporting further Science and Innovation Audits 
                 in eight new locations across the UK to help develop the evidence base of their research 
                 strengths and innovation capability. We have launched the call for bids for the next wave 
                 of audits.
             •   We have launched a review of the tax environment for R&D to examine whether there 
                 is more we should do to stimulate private sector investment and make the UK an even 
                 more competitive place to do R&D.
             •   We have established a high-level forum on EU Exit, Universities, Research and 
                 Innovation. It will advise on how best to build on the excellence of UK research and 
                 innovation, maximising the opportunity of the UK’s exit from the European Union.
          34      Building our Industrial Strategy
             New commitments:
             •   This paper starts the consultation on the priority challenges for the Industrial Strategy 
                 Challenge Fund, and other opportunities we can address using the increase in R&D 
                 funding. UKRI will then consult in more detail in early 2017 based on feedback to this 
                 Green Paper.  
             •   Given its importance to a range of new technologies, including the automotive sector, 
                 the government has also asked Chief Scientiifc Adviser Sir Mark Walport to review 
                 the case for a new research institution to act as a focal point for work on battery 
                 technology, energy storage and grid technology, reporting in early 2017.
             •   We will be commissioning independent research on approaches to commercialisation 
                 in different institutions, including how they approach licensing intellectual property and 
                 taking equity in spin-outs.
             •   We will seek to harness the potential of the UK’s home-grown inventors and stimulate 
                 user led innovation by launching a challenge prize programme. This prize, which will 
                 be piloted through the NESTA Challenge Prize Centre, will help inform our support to 
                 the ‘everyday entrepreneurs’ operating in companies and at home – such as through 
                 supporting enabling environments, incubators and maker spaces.
             •   We are reviewing how to maximise the incentives created by the Intellectual Property 
                 system to stimulate collaborative innovation and licensing opportunities – including 
                 considering the opening up of registries to facilitate licensing deals and business-
                 to-business model agreements to support collaboration. We will place Intellectual 
                 Property Ofifce representatives in key UK cities - starting with pilots in the Northern 
                 Powerhouse and Midlands Engine to build local capability to commercialise  
                 intellectual property.
             •   We will set out a UK Measurement Strategy, establishing a framework to capitalise 
                 on our National Measurement System which provides UK industry with world-leading 
                 measurement science and technology. The new strategy will ensure we have the 
                 knowledge and facilities to support all sectors to beneift from measurement – helping 
                 them to trade, manufacture and export.

                         Developing skills
             Actions under way:
             •   We are moving forward with schools reforms, consulting on our plans for a new, fair 
                 National Funding Formula for schools.
             •   We are delivering more, higher-quality apprenticeships and introducing the 
                 Apprenticeship Levy to bring in investment needed in our young people.
             •   Through the Sainsbury Review and the Skills Plan, the Government has set out its plan 
                 to radically simplify the thousands of vocational qualiifcations into a smaller number of 
                 high quality new routes.
             New commitments:
             •   We will create a proper system of technical education, to beneift the half of young 
                 people who do not go to university and provide new, better options for those already in 
                 the workforce. This involves creating a small number of high quality new routes, as set out 
                 in the Skills Plan, and attracting more industry specialists to work in the sector to raise the 
                 quality of higher skills training. 
             •   We are committing £170m of capital funding to the creation of prestigious new 
                 Institutes of Technology to deliver higher technical education in STEM subjects and 
                 meet the skills needs of employers in local areas.
             •   We will explore how to support further education colleges to be centres of 
                 excellence in teaching maths and English.
             •   We will explore how to give technical education learners clear information, which 
                 could include a way of searching and applying for courses similar to the UCAS process.
             •   Professor Sir Adrian Smith’s independent review of post-16 mathematics will propose 
                 measures to improve take up of mathematics and close large regional imbalances in 
                 take up of advanced mathematics.
             •   We will consider how to enable the specialist maths school model pioneered by Exeter 
                 and King’s College London to spread. We will seek partners to open mathematics 
                 schools of this kind across the country.
             •   We will explore and further encourage the uptake of STEM subjects to help meet unmet 
                 demand and build on the growth of recent years.
             •   We will work towards a joined-up, authoritative view of the sector speciifc skills gaps 
                 that the UK faces now and in the future.
          48      Building our Industrial Strategy
             •   We will publish a comprehensive careers strategy later this year to radically improve 
                 the quality and coverage of careers advice in schools and colleges, to make it easier for 
                 people to apply for technical education, and to give people the information they need to 
                 access training throughout their working lives.
             •   We will explore ambitious new approaches to encouraging lifelong learning,  
                 which could include assessing changes to the costs people face to make them less 
                 daunting; improving outreach to people where industries are changing; and providing 
                 better information.
             •   We will take further actions to address differences in skill levels between different 
                 areas to help drive economic growth and opportunity throughout the country (explored in 
                 later chapters of this paper).

               new transition year? Should we change the way that those resitting basic qualiifcations 
               study, to focus more on basic skills excellence?
            11. Do you agree with the different elements of the vision for the new technical education 
               system set out here? Are there further lessons from other countries’ systems? 
            12. How can we make the application process for further education colleges and 
               apprenticeships clearer and simpler, drawing lessons from the higher education sector? 
            13. What skills shortages do we have or expect to have, in particular sectors or local areas, 
               and how can we link the skills needs of industry to skills provision by educational 
               institutions in local areas?
            14. How can we enable and encourage people to retrain and upskill throughout their 
               working lives, particularly in places where industries are changing or declining?                               
               Are there particular sectors where this could be appropriate?

          57      Building our Industrial Strategy
                         Upgrading infrastructure
             Actions under way:
             •   We are providing greater certainty and a clear long-term direction: central government 
                 economic infrastructure investment will now rise by almost 60 per cent between 2016/17 
                 (£14 billion) and 2020/21 (£22 billion).
             •   We are creating a better institutional framework, with longer-term budgets and the 
                 creation of the National Infrastructure Commission. 
             •   The Government will deliver projects more effectively: We created the Infrastructure 
                 and Projects Authority in January 2016 to support the successful delivery of the 
                 Government’s infrastructure priorities. Part of both the Cabinet Ofifce and Treasury, it brings 
                 together the expertise of Infrastructure UK and the Major Projects Authority into a single 
                 organisation at the heart of government.
             •   We are supporting private sector infrastructure provision by providing the  
                 £40 billion UK Guarantees Scheme (UKGS) to help projects raise ifnance from the capital 
                 markets through Treasury-backed guarantees for infrastructure bonds and loans; and 
                 using private ifnance to deliver public assets through the Private Finance 2 model. The 
                 Autumn Statement 2016 included new announcements about both the UKGS and PF2: 
                 the government has extended the UKGS to at least 2026, and committed to explore 
                 construction-only guarantees; and has committed to explore a new pipeline of projects 
                 suitable for delivery through PF2, to be set out in early 2017.
             •   We are improving local involvement in infrastructure policy: The Government has 
                 agreed multiple mayoral devolution deals with cities and regions across England in recent 
                 years. These mayors will have control over a consolidated transport budget and 30-year 
                 investment funds, enabling strategic prioritisation of projects in a way that is properly 
                 informed by local need. Plans announced in the Autumn Statement 2016 will enable 
                 Mayoral Combined Authorities to borrow for investment, and the Government is consulting 
                 on introducing a new lower borrowing rate for local government infrastructure projects, 
                 helping local government ifnance and build infrastructure at a lower cost.
             •   Regional strategic transport bodies such as Transport for the North and Midlands 
                 Connect will help to ensure that transport projects are more closely linked with economic 
                 priorities, and so really beneift people across communities. We will support these regions 
                 to roll out smart ticketing across multiple transport types and are providing development 
                 funding for major upgrades to regional connectivity, including Northern Powerhouse Rail 
                 and the Midlands Rail Hub.
             •   Accelerating the digital modernisation of railways. The Autumn Statement allocated 
                 over £450 million to trial the deployment of digital signalling, which has the potential to 
                 increase capacity dramatically and improve reliability on existing rail routes. Over the next 
          58      Building our Industrial Strategy
                 10 years, public and private investment in digital rail signalling will aim to cement UK 
                 leadership in a global market which will be worth over £30 billion by 2020. To achieve this, 
                 we are developing a plan to introduce digital train control technologies on some of the 
                 UK’s busiest rail links, building on previous experience, and working closely with industry 
                 to maximise the opportunity the digital modernisation of railways offers for jobs and growth 
                 and the UK’s standing in a growing global market.
             •   Improving lfood defence and resilience. The Government is committed to spending  
                 £2.5 billion by 2021 on improving lfood defence and resilience, which will ensure 1,500 new 
                 lfood defence schemes are built and over 300,000 more homes are better protected. 
             •   We are making the UK the safest place to do business online: the Government’s 
                 £1.9 billion National Cyber Security Strategy set out how we will work to assess the level 
                 of cyber security across our critical national infrastructure and have measures in place to 
                 intervene where necessary to drive improvements that are in the national interest.
             •   The Infrastructure and Projects Authority will lead a new review to identify ways the 
                 Government, working with industry, can improve the quality, cost and performance  
                 of our infrastructure. The review will report in summer 2017 and will build on the 2010-
                 2014 Infrastructure Cost Review, which supported a 15 per cent reduction in the capital 
                 cost of projects. 
             •   The Chief Secretary to the Treasury will chair a new Infrastructure Delivery Ministerial 
                 Group which will oversee the delivery of the Government’s infrastructure commitments 
                 through tackling cross-cutting issues which are challenging the delivery of priority projects.
             New commitments:
             •   Using infrastructure to support rebalancing. As we develop and plan future rounds 
                 of infrastructure investment we will take account of the balance of spending per head 
                 between different regions. We will continue to prioritise the highest value-for-money 
                 projects, as we seek to address productivity weaknesses across the country, and unlock 
                 the beneifts of agglomeration economies.
             •   We will support key roads investments, including:
             •   The M60 North West Quadrant, the most congested road outside of London, which is 
                 holding back Greater Manchester and the north as a whole. Major upgrades to the M60 
                 around Manchester will ifx a bottleneck that holds back the growth of Manchester, and of 
                 the north as a whole.
             •   The A66 is an essential link across the north. We will transform the A66 from the A1 to the 
                 M6, with the ifrst new dual carriageway across the Pennines since 1971.
             •   A303 Stonehenge route. The A303 is an essential connection for the South West. A key 
                 part of the route runs past Stonehenge and we will be consulting on tunnel options that will 
                 cut congestion, improve journeys and enhance the iconic monument in its natural setting. 
          59      Building our Industrial Strategy
             •   Oxford to Cambridge. We have conifrmed plans to go ahead with a new expressway from 
                 Oxford to Cambridge. This will help some of our fastest-growing towns and cities create 
                 more jobs, change the way people travel nationwide, and take trafifc off of roads as far 
                 apart as London and Birmingham.
             •   Lower Thames Crossing. More than 47,000 people took part in the consultation on the 
                 Lower Thames Crossing earlier this year making it the largest ever public consultation for 
                 a UK road project. The Government will consider the ifndings and take a decision on the 
                 location, route and type of crossing in due course.
             •   We will support other major infrastructure investments, including:
             •   Connected and autonomous vehicles. We will cement the UK’s position as a go-to 
                 destination for the development of this technology by establishing a new testing ecosystem, 
                 using both controlled and real world environments. We will announce the location of the 
                 coordinating hub for this project by spring 2017.
             •   Local transport. We have announced initial allocations to local areas for 2017/18 from the 
                 additional £1.1 billion of funding for local roads and transport.
             Questions for consultation
             As part of producing its National Infrastructure Assessment, the National Infrastructure 
             Commission has issued a detailed call for evidence, seeking views from stakeholders on a 
             range of questions about UK infrastructure policy. The National Infrastructure Commission’s 
             call for evidence  is open until 10 February 2017. The questions below seek to complement 
             this work. 
             15. Are there further actions we could take to support private investment in infrastructure?
             16. How can local infrastructure needs be incorporated within national UK infrastructure 
                 policy most effectively?
             17. What further actions can we take to improve the performance of infrastructure towards 
                 international benchmarks?  How can government work with industry to ensure we have 
                 the skills and supply chain needed to deliver strategic infrastructure in the UK?

                 scale up.
             •   We have invested an additional £400million in the British Business Bank to catalyse 
                 later stage venture capital investments by the private sector. 
             •   We have committed to provide £13 million of funding for the Productivity Council, 
                 over three years. The Council will provide strong, sustained leadership and business-to-
                 business advice to raise productivity across the business community.
             •   The Government has published a Corporate Governance Green Paper, which includes 
                 options for strengthening the link between executive pay and long term company 
                 performance, and encouraging greater investment by ifrms. 
             New commitments:

                 Enterprise Partnerships, Growth Hubs, the ScaleUp Institute and other partners.
             •   We will explore how data – such as that held by HMRC and Companies House – can 
                 be used to identify scale-up businesses and be made available to enable local public 
                 and private sector organisations to better identify, target and evaluate their support to 
                 scale-up businesses more effectively.
             •   We will continue to build on the success of the British Business Bank, and will  
                 work with the Business Growth Fund (BGF) and other private partners to raise 
                 awareness of equity funding, diversify funding streams and increase the supply of ifnance 
                 for growing businesses.

             •   We will explore how we can support the development of B2B ratings and feedback 
                 platforms to make it easier for SMEs to determine the quality of business advice and 
                 support services provided to them by other ifrms.
             •   A review into entrepreneurship will be led by the Chief Entrepreneurial Adviser at the 
                 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The review will assess the 
                 support currently available to entrepreneurs and consider international best practice  
                 with the aim of identifying any potential gaps in current policy.

         throughout the country. We will also explore 
         where there are sectors which could beneift 
         from support to create trade fairs, in particular, 
         in emerging sectors such as the innovative 
         technology industries.

                         Encouraging trade and investment
             Actions under way:
             •   Doubling export ifnance capacity. In the Autumn Statement we announced that we 
                 will improve the competitive edge of UK exporters by doubling the capacity UK Export 
                 Finance is able to provide and increasing fourfold the number of foreign currencies that it 
                 supports.
             •   We are making it easier for ifrms to access government support through a ground-
                 breaking new digital platform to provide digital services to help exporters and investors: 
                 great.gov.uk. 
             •   Joining up trade and investment promotion with local areas, with area-speciifc trade 
                 missions working with local areas to highlight opportunities.
             •   Improving market access for exporters. The Department for International Trade is 
                 working hard to support businesses through discussions on market access issues with 
                 third countries.
             New commitments:
             •   Building future trading relationships. We are encouraged that countries such as 
                 Canada, China, India, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea have already said they want to 
                 discuss our future trading relationships. We have established a series of working groups 
                 with key trade partners.
             •   Creating a new more active “Team UK” approach to winning overseas contracts, 
                 with the Government helping convene consortia of companies to back a single UK bid 
                 for major overseas projects. This will enable the Government to provide strong political 
                 support and increase the chances of winning major overseas contracts. This approach 
                 also applies to increasing defence exports.
             •   Developing a new, more strategic approach to inward investment. The Department 
                 for International Trade will review what we can learn from successful inward investment 
                 promotion agencies across the globe and it will report in 2017. We will consider whether 
                 there should be a greater emphasis on the effect of investment projects on growth. 
             •   We are also working with behavioural insights experts, to improve our targeting of 
                 potential exporters and using HMRC data.
             •   We will explore how we can maximise the opportunities that a UK presence at existing 
                 international trade fairs offers for businesses; and explore where there are sectors 
                 which could beneift from support to create trade fairs, in particular in emerging sectors 
                 such as the innovative technology industries.

             their exports?
          26. What can we learn from other countries to improve our support for inwar    d investment 
             and how we measure its success? Should we put more emphasis on measuring the 
             impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on growth?

                         Delivering affordable energy and clean growth
             Actions under way:
             •   We have acted to limit policy costs on energy bills and have reduced such costs for 
                 the most energy intensive industries by up to around 80 per cent.
             •   We have doubled support for energy innovation, and are already investing £600 million 
                 in support to accelerate the transition to ultra low emission vehicles. Additional funding of 
                 £270 million was announced in the 2016 Autumn Statement. 
             •   We are requiring energy suppliers to offer interactive smart meters to every household 
                 and small business site in Great Britain by the end of 2020.
             New commitments:
             •   The Government will set out in 2017 a long-term road map to minimise business  
                 energy costs.
             •   To inform this, the Government will commission a review of the opportunities to reduce 
                 the cost of achieving our decarbonisation goals in the power and industrial sectors. 
                 The review will cover how best to support greater energy efifciency, the scope to use 
                 existing instruments to support further reductions in the cost of offshore wind once 
                 current commitments have been delivered, and how the Government can best work with 
                 Ofgem to ensure markets and networks operate as efifciently as possible in a low carbon 
                 system. We will also review the opportunities for growth from the energy sector and the 
                 opportunities for the UK. 
             •   We will publish our Emissions Reduction Plan during 2017, providing long-term 
                 certainty for investors.
             •   As set out above we will review the case for a new research institution to act as a focal 
                 point for work on battery technology, energy storage and grid technology, reporting in 
                 early 2017.

           Questions for consultation
           27. What are the most important steps the Government should take to limit energy costs 
               over the long term?
           28. How can we move towards a position in which energy is supplied by competitive 
               markets without the requirement for ongoing subsidy?
           29. How can the Government, business and researchers work together to develop  
               the competitive opportunities from innovation in energy and our existing                              
               industrial strengths?
           30. How can the Government support businesses in realising cost savings through  
               greater resource and energy efifciency?

           Questions for consultation
           31. How can the Government and industry help sectors come together to identify the 
              opportunities for a ‘sector deal’ to address – especially where industries are fragmented 
              or not well deifned?
           32. How can the Government ensure that ‘sector deals’ promote competition and 
              incorporate the interests of new entrants?
           33. How can the Government and industry collaborate to enable growth in new sectors of 
              the future that emerge around new technologies and new business models?

                     Driving growth across the whole country
           Actions under way:
           •  The Government has announced the award of an additional £1.8 billion from the Local 
              Growth Fund for a new set of Growth Deals between Government and Local Enterprise 
              Partnerships.
           •  We have already set out the next steps in developing the Northern Powerhouse by 
              launching a Northern Powerhouse Strategy. We will be setting out a Midlands Engine 
              strategy soon. 
           •  We have launched a Tourism Action Plan, setting out a comprehensive set of actions to 
              drive growth in inbound tourist spend across the whole of the UK. 
           New commitments:
           •  The Government will use additional infrastructure funding to unlock growth in 
              areas where connectivity is holding it back by creating new funding which allow better 
              coordination of local economic plans with infrastructure investment. 
           •  The Government will take account of the varying infrastructure needs and 
              opportunities in different regions. 
           •  We will deliver major infrastructure improvements which will help to drive growth 
              across the country, including supporting the development of proposals for the Midlands 
              Rail Hub and Northern Powerhouse Rail.
           •  We will work with local areas to test approaches to closing the skills gap; from early 
              years education and the retention and attraction of graduates, to measures to drive the 
              take up of apprenticeships.
           •  We propose creating competitive new funding streams to back the clusters of 
              innovative businesses across the country. These could support and develop  
              world-class research and innovation strengths in local economies, and provide 
              commercialisation funding to allow universities to work more with local businesses.  
              In this way we will use some of the additional R&D funding to help stimulate local 
              economies, as well as growing the UK overall.
           •  We will work with local areas to identify and help develop industrial and economic 
              clusters of businesses, and local specialisms, putting in place the right institutions 
              with the right powers to help support local areas of economic strength. This may involve 
              creating new institutions or strengthening existing ones, discussed further below.
        117    Building our Industrial Strategy
           •  We propose establishing Ministerial Forums on Industrial Strategy with each of 
              the Devolved Administrations. These will bring together all relevant UK Government 
              Departments and the Devolved Administrations to consider how the industrial strategy 
              can best address key productivity barriers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This 
              is an open invitation to representatives of each Devolved Administration to develop jointly 
              plans with the UK Government to support all areas of the UK, and to align closely our 
              economic plans and strategies.
           Questions for consultation
           34. Do you agree the principles set out above are the right ones? If not what is missing?
           35. What are the most important new approaches to raising skill levels in areas where 
              they are lower? Where could investments in connectivity or innovation do most to help 
              encourage growth across the country?

           Institutions for local growth
           Many successful clusters around the world share certain key features.
           Local business and ifnancial institutions 
           •  Certain ‘anchor’ businesses can play a key role in attracting skilled workers to an area, 
              or generating spin off companies. Some anchor businesses can attract a whole supply 
              chain to locate near them, bringing further growth to the area. The Government may be 
              able to help build on this and support the growth of such supply chains in the UK.
              Local ifnancial institutions such as local venture capital networks and investment funds 
              attached to speciifc universities can support growth.
           Local leadership institutions 
           •  Local authorities can help to coordinate the different things that local industries need 
              to thrive, from planning decisions, transport and skills to investments in culture and the 
              quality of life.
           •  Local Enterprise Partnerships create strategic plans for wider areas, including entire 
              cities, and give businesses a direct role in shaping the future of their local communities.
           •  Where they exist, Mayoral Combined Authorities support regional planning for transport 
              and improvements in skills.
         121    Building our Industrial Strategy
           Interest groups and advocacy groups 
           •   Local business associations can play an important role in aggregating the interests of 
               local businesses, promoting a particular cluster to the world, advocating on its behalf to 
               government, providing training, and building networks to improve the lfow of knowledge 
               and contacts. Chambers of Commerce, other business groups, and entrepreneur 
               networks around universities can help small business ifnd advice and support.
           Institutions that support innovation
           •   Universities can have a big impact on local growth and regeneration, including by 
               attracting young skilled people; spinning out ifrms; and attracting research intensive 
               businesses to locate in the area. 
           •   Government and research council labs and other innovation institutions can contribute 
               to the strengths of local clusters in a similar way.
           •   Innovation Districts, Science Parks, Catapults and incubator spaces can help ideas 
               to lfow and business connections to be made within a cluster. Government policy can 
               help create these kind of opportunities for clustering.
           Cultural, sporting and quality of life institutions
           •   Cultural institutions and regular events can act as a magnet for visitors, promote a 
               cluster and help attract talented people to locate there. Media institutions like the BBC 
               can help to anchor creative clusters, as it has done in Salford.
           Connectivity institutions
           •   Ports and airports are major local employers in their own right, but better connections 
               also help to promote trade and create jobs.
         Our approach                                      strength. This may involve creating new

         are needed.
         Similarly, we will work with local areas to identify 
         and help develop local specialisms, putting 
         in place the right institutions with the right 
         powers to help support local areas of economic 
        122    Building our Industrial Strategy
           A case study of the institutions that support a cluster: Cambridge
           The University of Cambridge and other research institutions, including the nearby Laboratory 
           of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Science Park and Addenbrooke’s Hospital are at the heart 
           of a substantial cluster of tech and biotech businesses. The area has been among the fastest 
           growing in the country in recent decades. 
           But great universities and laboratories do not automatically go on to generate substantial 
           economic growth for an area. Other institutions have played a key role in creating the cluster, 
           and others now support its continuing growth.
           Anchor companies have played a critical role. In 1960 Cambridge Consultants was founded, 
           a ifrm of consultants aiming to “put the brains of Cambridge University at the disposal of the 
           problems of British industry”. It has created numerous spin-outs, which have created spin-
           outs of their own.
           Later companies have continued the approach, seeding numerous other businesses.  
           For example, the early microcomputer company Acorn led to many tech businesses, 
           including ARM holdings. In the biotechnology sector, early British biotech company Enzymatix 
           spawned ifrms such as Chiroscience, which was later acquired by Celltech. ICI’s early work 
           on inkjet printing technology at Cambridge Consultants provided the impetus for a whole 
           cluster of printing businesses in the area today.
           Entrepreneurs like Hermann Hauser and Chris Evans who were involved in companies in 
           the cluster have gone on to become venture capital providers to the wider Cambridge tech 
           scene. The university has also worked with ifnanciers to create a £125 million investment fund 
           attached to the university, Cambridge Innovation Capital.
        123    Building our Industrial Strategy
           The mature cluster has strong networking institutions for business, ranging from the 
           Cambridge Network which promotes the cluster to sector-speciifc knowledge networks like 
           Cambridge Wireless and One Nucleus promoting the tech and biotech industries respectively. 
           Institutions for new entrepreneurs like the Judge Business School have been founded with 
           its postgraduate diploma in Entrepreneurship, the Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning, and 
           “Cambridge University Entrepreneurs” (CUE) – a society for young entrepreneurs. Science 
           parks and incubator centres like the St John’s Innovation Centre promote cross fertilisation of 
           ideas, and make it easier for new companies to ifnd lfexible space.
           Cambridge University was also one of the ifrst to create a technology transfer ofifce, starting 
           with the Wolfson Cambridge Industrial Unit, now Cambridge Enterprise.
           Local authorities in the area continue to work together with the private sector to support 
           growth, including to provide for growing housing needs. 
           Through the Greater Cambridge City Deal and the recent Devolution Deal for Cambridgeshire 
           and Peterborough, the area is gaining new powers over transport and skills, enabling it to 
           support continued expansion. Work by the National Infrastructure Commission and plans for 
           better road and rail connections through the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge corridor will 
           also enable the area to improve its connections.
        124    Building our Industrial Strategy
                     Creating the right institutions         
                     to bring together sectors and places
           Actions under way:
           •  Local Enterprise Partnerships, established in all parts of England. 
           •  Mayoral Combined Authorities have been established as part of Devolution Deals, with 
              the ifrst mayoral elections in May.
           •  We are fully devolving business rate revenues to local authorities in England.
           New commitments:
           •  Where appropriate we will maximise the beneift that anchor companies can bring to an 
              area by developing new policies to support the growth of UK supply chains.  
           •  The Department for International Trade will review how it identiifes priority 
              investments, including with reference to the impact they can make in local areas where 
              productivity needs to catch up. As part of this, the department will consider the role it can 
              play in attracting investment across all regions of the UK.
           •  Cabinet Ofifce are reviewing the location of government agencies and arms-length 
              bodies, and will consider relocating them where they could potentially help reinforce a 
              local cluster and support private sector growth. 
           •  Recognising the importance of cultural and sporting institutions in making different places 
              attractive to people and ifrms, the review of arms-length bodies will include cultural 
              institutions, particularly where cultural assets could be better used to support local areas 
              – for example, the Government Art Collection. 
           •  The Government will review whether there is more that can be done to leverage 
              government and research council laboratories to drive local growth. This will  
              include considering their role in supporting wider innovation districts and whether  
              surplus government land or buildings could be used to support innovative businesses 
              around them.
           •  The Government will support networks of universities where they want to come 
              together to improve commercialisation. Regional groups of universities like the N8, 
              SETsquared and Midlands Innovation groups are already working together on projects. 
              Government could help to deepen this cooperation, which could include helping to form 
              joint investment funds covering groups of universities.
           •  The Government will work with the British Business Bank and ScaleUp Institute to 
              understand and address the relative weakness of venture capital funding and 
              entrepreneurship networks outside the South East.
        125    Building our Industrial Strategy
           •  We have already given local government in England greater freedoms to support growth 
              and are in the process of allowing local authorities to retain 100% of the business rates 
              they collect. We will work with local government to review how to bring more 
              business expertise into local governance, and improve links between councils and 
              the private sector. An example might be the creation of a modern “Alderman” type of 
              role within local government.
           •  We will explore further devolution deals for our largest cities, where they will increase 
              economic growth, in a clear signal of belief in our local leaders and local communities to 
              take control of their economic destiny.
           •  Following the elections for the ifrst combined authority mayors in May 2017, the Local 
              Government Association will work with new Mayoral Combined Authorities to 
              build up administrative capacity, for example in transport planning and economic 
              development, which could involve seconding ofifcials from Whitehall to cities.
           •  We will work with Local Enterprise Partnerships to review their role in delivering 
              local growth and examine how we can spread best practice and strengthen them, 
              including extending the support they can receive from the What Works centre for Local 
              Economic Growth. We are determined to help local areas, and national agencies, learn 
              from what works best and where, so that we can together reifne and maximise the 
              impacts of the major investments set out in this paper for prosperity and growth.
           Questions for consultation
           36. Recognising the need for local initiative and leadership, how should we best work with 
              local areas to create and strengthen key local institutions? 
           37. What are the most important institutions which we need to upgrade or support to back 
              growth in particular areas?
           38. Are there institutions missing in certain areas which we could help cr               eate or strengthen 
              to support local growth?

        127    Building our Industrial Strategy
           Questions for consultation
           1.  Does this document identity the right areas of focus: extending our str                      engths; 
              closing the gaps; and making the UK one of the most competitive places to start                                                                  
              or grow a business? 
           2.  Are the ten pillars suggested the right ones to tackle low productivity and unbalanced 
              growth? If not, which areas are missing? 
           3.  Are the right central government and local institutions in place to deliver an effective 
              industrial strategy? If not, how should they be reformed? Are the types of measures to 
              strengthen local institutions set out here and below the right ones?
           4.  Are there important lessons we can learn from the industrial policies of other countries 
              which are not relfected in these ten pillars?
           5.  What should be the priority areas for science, research and innovation investment?
           6.  Which challenge areas should the Industrial Challenge Strategy Fund focus on to drive 
              maximum economic impact?
           7.  What else can the UK do to create an environment that supports the commer                     cialisation 
              of ideas?
           8.  How can we best support the next generation of research leaders and entrepreneurs?
           9.  How can we best support research and innovation strengths in local areas?
           10. What more can we do to improve basic skills? How can we make a success of the 
              new transition year? Should we change the way that those resitting basic qualiifcations 
              study, to focus more on basic skills excellence?
           11. Do you agree with the different elements of the vision for the new technical education 
              system set out here? Are there further lessons from other countries’ systems? 
           12. How can we make the application process for further education colleges and 
              apprenticeships clearer and simpler, drawing lessons from the higher education sector? 
           13. What skills shortages do we have or expect to have, in particular sectors or local areas, 
              and how can we link the skills needs of industry to skills provision by educational 
              institutions in local areas?
           14. How can we enable and encourage people to retrain and upskill throughout their 
              working lives, particularly in places where industries are changing or declining?                      
              Are there particular sectors where this could be appropriate?
           15. Are there further actions we could take to support private investment in infrastructure?
        128    Building our Industrial Strategy
           16. How can local infrastructure needs be incorporated within national UK infrastructure 
              policy most effectively?
           17. What further actions can we take to improve the performance of infrastructure towards 
              international benchmarks? How can government work with industry to ensure we have 
              the skills and supply chain needed to deliver strategic infrastructure in the UK?
           18. What are the most important causes of lower rates of ifxed capital investment in the UK 
              compared to other countries, and how can they be addressed?
           19. What are the most important factors which constrain quoted companies and fund 
              managers from making longer term investment decisions, and how can we best 
              address these factors?
           20. Given public sector investment already accounts for a large shar                  e of equity deals 
              in some regions, how can we best catalyse uptake of equity capital outside the                                                  
              South East?
           21. How can we drive the adoption of new funding opportunities like cr                                            owdfunding across 
              the country?
           22. What are the barriers faced by those businesses that have the potential to scale-up 
              and achieve greater growth, and how can we address these barriers? Where are the 
              outstanding examples of business networks for fast growing ifrms which we could learn 
              from or spread?
           23. Are there further steps that the Government can take to support innovation thr                       ough 
              public procurement? 
           24. What further steps can be taken to use public procurement to drive the industrial 
              strategy in areas where government is the main client, such as healthcare and defence? 
              Do we have the right institutions and policies in place in these sectors to exploit 
              government’s purchasing power to drive economic growth?
           25. What can the Government do to improve our support for ifrms wanting to start 
              exporting? What can the Government do to improve support for ifrms in increasing  
              their exports?
           26. What can we learn from other countries to improve our support for inwar              d investment 
              and how we measure its success? Should we put more emphasis on measuring the 
              impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on growth?
           27. What are the most important steps the Government should take to limit energy costs 
              over the long-term?
           28. How can we move towards a position in which energy is supplied by competitive 
              markets without the requirement for on-going subsidy?
        129    Building our Industrial Strategy
           29. How can the Government, business and researchers work together to develop 
              the competitive opportunities from innovation in energy and our existing industrial 
              strengths?
           30. How can the Government support businesses in realising cost savings through greater 
              resource and energy efifciency?
           31. How can the Government and industry help sectors come together to identify the 
              opportunities for a ‘sector deal’ to address – especially where industries are fragmented 
              or not well deifned?
           32. How can the Government ensure that ‘sector deals’ promote competition and 
              incorporate the interests of new entrants?
           33. How can the Government and industry collaborate to enable growth in new sectors of 
              the future that emerge around new technologies and new business models?
           34. Do you agree the principles set out above are the right ones?  If not what is missing?
           35. What are the most important new approaches to raising skill levels in areas where 
              they are lower? Where could investments in connectivity or innovation do most to help 
              encourage growth across the country?
           36. Recognising the need for local initiative and leadership, how should we best work with 
              local areas to create and strengthen key local institutions? 
           37. What are the most important institutions which we need to upgrade or support to back 
              growth in particular areas?
