                         However, in additional self-report surveys, participants responded feeling more distant, 
                         or less intimate, towards their Internet partner than their non-Internet partner.  This 
                         finding may be attributed to participants’ beliefs that email is an inferior mode of 
                         personal relationship communication. 
                                   Intimacy is necessary in the creation and maintenance of relationships, as it is 
                         defined as the sharing of a person’s innermost being with another person, i.e., self-
                         disclosure (Hu, Wood, Smith, & Westbrook, 2004).  Relationships are facilitated by the 
                         reciprocal self-disclosing between partners, regardless of non-CMC or CMC.  Cummings 
                         et al.’s (2002) reviewed results contradict other studies that research the connection 
                         between intimacy and relationships through CMC.   
                                   Hu et al. (2004) studied the relationship between the frequency of Instant 
                         Messenger (IM) use and the degree of perceived intimacy among friends.  The use of IM 
                         instead of email as a CMC modality was studied because IM supports a non-professional 
             VARYING DEFINITIONS OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION                  5 
             environment favoring intimate exchanges (Hu et al., 2004).  Their results suggest that a 
             positive relationship exists between the frequency of IM use and intimacy, demonstrating 
             that participants feel closer to their Internet partner as time progresses through this CMC 
             modality. 
                  Similarly, Underwood and Findlay (2004) studied the effect of Internet 
             relationships on primary, specifically non-Internet relationships and the perceived 
             intimacy of both.  In this study, self-disclosure, or intimacy, was measured in terms of 
             shared secrets through the discussion of personal problems.  Participants reported a 
             significantly higher level of self-disclosure in their Internet relationship as compared to 
             their primary relationship.  In contrast, the participants’ primary relationships were 
             reported as highly self-disclosed in the past, but the current level of disclosure was 
             perceived to be lower (Underwood & Findlay, 2004).  This result suggests participants 
             turned to the Internet in order to fulfill the need for intimacy in their lives. 
                  In further support of this finding, Tidwell and Walther (2002) hypothesized CMC 
             participants employ deeper self-disclosures than FtF participants in order to overcome the 
             limitations of CMC, e.g., the reliance on nonverbal cues.  It was found that CMC partners 
             engaged in more frequent intimate questions and disclosures than FtF partners in order to 
             overcome the barriers of CMC.  In their 2002 study, Tidwell and Walther measured the 
             perception of a relationship’s intimacy by the partner of each participant in both the CMC 
             and FtF conditions.  The researchers found that the participants’ partners stated their 
             CMC partner was more effective in employing more intimate exchanges than their FtF

                            partner, and both participants and their partners rated their CMC relationship as more

       A Level 3            examined only email correspondence for their CMC modality.  Therefore, the study is

       the left 
       margin,              by Hu et al.  (2004).  Because of its many personalized features, IM provides more 
       bolded, and 
       lower case           personal CMC.  For example, it is in real time without delay, voice-chat and video 
       (except for 
       the first 
       word). Text          features are available for many IM programs, and text boxes can be personalized with the

             (2002).  Self-disclosure and intimacy may result from IM’s individualized features, 
             which are not as personalized in email correspondence.   
                  Demographic limitations. In addition to the limitations of email, Cummings et 
             al. (2002) reviewed studies that focused on international bank employees and college 
             students (see Appendix B for demographic information).  It is possible the participants’ 
             CMC through email was used primarily for business, professional, and school matters 
             and not for relationship creation or maintenance.  In this case, personal self-disclosure 
             and intimacy levels are expected to be lower for non-relationship interactions, as this 
             communication is primarily between boss and employee or student and professor.  
             Intimacy is not required, or even desired, for these professional relationships. 
                  Modality limitations. Instead of professional correspondence, however, 
             Cummings et al.’s (2002) review of the HomeNet project focused on already established 
             relationships and CMC’s effect on relationship maintenance.  The HomeNet 
             researchers’ sole dependence on email communication as CMC may have contributed to 
             the lower levels of intimacy and closeness among Internet relationships as compared to 
             non-Internet relationships (as cited in Cummings et al., 2002).  The barriers of non-
             personal communication in email could be a factor in this project, and this could lead to 
             less intimacy among these Internet partners.  If alternate modalities of CMC were 
             studied in both already established and professional relationships, perhaps these results 
             would have resembled those of the previously mentioned research.
