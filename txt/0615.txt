 PLEASE READ PRIOR TO INSTALLATION FOR SAFETY.  
  Disconnect AC input  power before connecting any wiring to the AC motor drive. 
 There are highly sensitive MOS components on the printed circuit boards. These 
components are especially sensitive to static electricity. Take anti-static measures 
before touching these components or the circuit boards. These components are 
especially sensitive to static electricity. Please do not touch these components or the 
circuit boards before taking anti-static measures. 
 Never modify the internal components or wiring. 
 Ground the AC motor drive by using the ground terminal. The grounding method 
must comply with the laws of the country where the AC motor drive is to be installed. 
 DO NOT install the AC motor drive in a place subjected to high temperature, direct 
sunlight and inflammables.  
  Never connect the AC motor drive output terminals U/T1, V/T2 and W/T3 directly to 
the AC mains circuit power supply. 
 After finishing the wiring of the AC motor drive, check if U/T1, V/T2 and W/T3 are 
short-circuited to ground with a multimeter. Do NOT power the drive if short circuits 
occur. Eliminate the short circuits before the drive is powered. 
 Rated voltage of power system to install motor drives is as below, make sure that the 
installation voltage is within the ranges mentioned below while installing the motor 
drives: 
For 115V models, the range is between 85–132 V. 
For 230V models, the range is between 170–264 V. 
For 460V models, the range is between 323–528 V. 
For 575V models, the range is between 425V–660V. 
 Refer to the table below for short circuit rating: 
Model (Power) Short circuit rating 
115V 5 kA 
230V 5 kA 
460V 5 kA 
575V 5 kA 
 Only qualified persons are allowed to install, wire and maintain the AC motor drives. 
 Even if the three-phase AC motor is stopped, a charge with hazardous voltages may 
still remain in the main circuit terminals of the AC motor drive. 
 The performance of electrolytic capacitor will degrade if it is not charged for a long 
time. It is recommended to charge the drive which is stored in no charge condition 
every 2 years for 3–4 hours to restore the performance of electrolytic capacitor in the 
motor drive.  
Note: When power up the motor drive, use adjustable AC power source (ex. AC 
autotransformer) to charge the drive at 70% –80% of rated voltage for 30 minutes (do 
not run the motor drive). Then charge the drive at 100% of rated voltage for an hour 
(do not run the motor drive). By doing these, restore the performance of electrolytic

 capacitor before starting to run the motor drive. Do NOT run the motor drive at 100% 
rated voltage right away. 
 Pay attention to the following when tr ansporting and installing this package 
(including wooden crate and wood stave). 
1 If you need to deworm the wooden crate,  do not use fumigation or you will 
damage the drive. Any damage to the drive caused by using fumigation 
voids the warranty. 
2 Use other methods, such as heat treatment or any other non-fumigation 
treatment, to deworm the wood packaging material. 
3 If you use heat treatment to deworm, leave the packaging materials in an 
environment of over 56°C for a minimum of thirty minutes. 
 Connect the drive to a three-phase three-wire or three-phase four-wire Wye system 
to comply with UL standards.  
 If the motor drive produces a leakage current of over 3.5mA AC or over 10mA 
DC on the Protective Earthing conductor, the minimum specifications required of 
the Protective Earthing conductor to be installed have to comply with the 
national, local laws and regulations or follow IEC61800-5-1 to do grounding.

 1-2 After receiving the AC motor drive, check for the following: 
1. Inspect the unit after unpacking to ensure that it was not damaged during shipment. Make sure that 
the part number printed on the package matches the part number indicated on the nameplate. 
2. Make sure that the mains voltage is within the range indicated on the nameplate. Install the AC motor 
drive according to the instructions in this manual. 
3. Before applying power, make sure that all devices, including mains power, motor, control board and 
digital keypad, are connected correctly. 
4. When wiring the AC motor drive, make sure that the wiring of  input terminals “R/L1, S/L2, T/L3” and 
output terminals “U/T1, V/T2, W/T3” are correct to prevent dama ge to the drive. 
5. When power is applied, use the digital keypad (KPMS-LE01) to select the language and set 
parameters. When executing a trial run, begin with a low speed and then gradually increase the 
speed to the desired speed.

1 The drive contains Varistors / MOVs that are connected from p hase to phase and from phase to 
ground to prevent the drive from unexpected stop or damage caus ed by mains surges or voltage 
spikes. Because the Varistors / MOVs from phase to ground are connected to ground with the RFI 
jumper, removing the RFI jumper disables the protection. 
2 In models with a built-in EMC filter, the RFI jumper connects the filer capacitors to ground to form a 
return path for high frequency noise in order to isolate the no ise from contaminating the mains power. 
Removing the RFI jumper strongly reduces the effect of the buil t-in EMC filter. Although a single drive 
complies with the international standards for leakage current, an installation with several drives with 
built-in EMC filters can trigger the RCD. Removing the RFI jump er helps, but the EMC performance of 
each drive is no longer guaranteed.  
Frame A–F  Screw Torque: 4–6 kg-cm / [3.5–5.2 lb-in.] / [0.39–0.59 Nm] 
Loosen the screw and remove the RFI jumper (as shown below).  
Tighten the screw again after you remove the RFI jumper.  
 
Frame B–F  (model with built-in EMC filter)  
Remove the RFI jumper with a slotted screwdriver (as shown belo w).

 1-6 Isolating main power from ground: 
When the power distribution syst em for the drive is a floating ground system (IT Systems) or an 
asymmetric ground system (Corner Grounded TN Systems), you must  remove the RFI jumper. Removing 
the RFI jumper disconnects the internal capacitors from ground to avoid damaging the internal circuits and to reduce the ground leakage current. 
Important points regarding ground connection  
 To ensure the safety of personnel, proper operation, and to re duce electromagnetic radiation, you 
must properly ground the motor and drive during installation.  
 The diameter of the grounding cables must comply with the local safety regulations. 
 You must connect the shielded cable to the motor drive’s ground to meet safety regulations. 
 Only use the shielded cable as the ground for equipment when the aforementioned points are met. 
 When installing multiple drives, do not connect the grounds of  the drives in series but connect each 
drive to ground. The following pictures show the correct and wr ong ways to connect the grounds. 
  
Pay particular attention to the following points:   Do not remove the RFI jumper while the power is on. 
 Removing the RFI jumper also cuts the capacitor conductivity of the surge absorber to ground and the 
built-in EMC filter capacitors. Compliance with the EMC specifi cations is no longer guaranteed. 
 Do not remove the RFI jumper if the mains power is a symmetric al grounded power system in order to 
maintain the efficiency for EMC circuit. 
 Remove the RFI jumper when conducting high voltage tests. When conducting a high voltage test to 
the entire facility, disconnect the mains power and the motor i f the leakage current is too high. 
Floating Ground System (IT Systems) 
A floating ground system is also called an IT system, an ungrounded system, or a high impedance/ resistance (greater than 30 Ω) grounded system. 
 Remove the RFI jumper to disconnect the ground cable from the internal filter capacitor and surge 
absorber. 
 Do not install an external RFI/EMC filter. The external EMC filter passes through a filter capacitor and 
connects power input to the ground. This is very dangerous and damages the motor drive. 
 In situations where EMC is required, use an EMC filter specifi cally for IT system if necessary. 
Disconnecting the ground cable from the filter prevents damage to the motor drive but compliance 
with EMC is no longer guaranteed. 
 In situations where EMC is required, check for excess electromagnetic radiation affecting nearby 
low-voltage circuits. In some situations, the adapter and cable  naturally provide enough suppression. 
If in doubt, install an extra electrostatic shielded cable on t he power supply side between the main 
circuit and the control terminals to increase shielding.

 1-7 Asymmetric Ground System (Corner Grounded TN Systems)  
Caution:  Do not remove the RFI jumper while power to the input terminal  of the drive is ON. 
In the following four situations, you must remove the RFI jumpe r. This is to prevent the system from 
grounding through the RFI and filter capacitors and damaging th e drive. 
You must remove the RFI jumper for an asymmetric ground system  
1. Grounding at a corner in a triangle configuration

 2. Grounding at a midpoint in a polygonal 
configuration

You can use the RFI jumper for a symmetrical grounding power sy stem  
In a situation with a symmetrical grounding power system, you
can use the RFI jumper to maintain the effect of the built-in EMC filter and surge absorber. For example, the diagram onthe right is a symmetrical grounding power system.

 Prevent fiber particles, scraps of paper, shredded wood, sawdust, metal particles, etc. from adhering 
to the heat sink. 
 Install the AC motor drive in a metal cabinet. When installing one drive below another one, use a metal separator between the AC motor drives to prevent mutual heating and to prevent the risk of fire 
accident. 
 Install the AC motor drive in a Pollution Degree 2 environment with clean and circulating air. A clean 
and circulating environment means air without polluting substances and dust. 
 Mount the drive in an IP54 cabinet in order to maintain the Pollution Degree 2 or in a pollution- 
controlled environment. When installing the AC motor drive in a Pollution Degree 2 ( IEC/EN 
60664-1 ) environment,  only nonconductive pollution occurs for the electrical equipment in the 
cabinet and thermostatic chamber and temporary conductivity caused by condensation is expected. 
The appearances shown in the following figures are for reference only. The actual motor drives may look

 4-2 After removing the front cover, verify that the power and contr ol terminals are clearly noted. Read the 
following precautions before wiring. 
 
  Turn off the AC motor drive power  before doing any wiring. A charge with 
hazardous voltages may remain in the DC bus capacitors even aft er the power has 
been turned off for a short time. Measure the remaining voltage with a DC voltmeter 
on +1/DC+ and DC- before doing any wiring. For your safety, do not start wiring 
before the voltage drops to a safe level (less than 25 V DC). Installing wiring with a 
residual voltage may cause personal injury, sparks and a short circuit. 
 Only qualified personnel familiar with AC motor drives are all owed to perform 
installation, wiring and commissioning. Make sure the power is turned off before 
wiring to prevent electric shock. 
 Make sure that power is only applied to the R/L1, S/L2, and T/L3 terminals. Failure 
to comply may result in damage to the equipment. The voltage an d current must be 
in the range indicated on the nameplate (refer to Section 1-1 N ameplate 
Information for details). 
 All units must be grounded directly to a common ground termina l to prevent 
damage from a lightning strike or electric shock and reduce noi se interference.  
 Tighten the screws of the main circuit terminals to prevent sp arks caused by screws 
loosened due to vibration.  
  For you safety, choose wires that comply with local regulations when wiring. 
 Check the following items after finishing the wiring: 
1. Are all connections correct? 2. Are there any loose wires? 3. Are there any short circuits between the terminals or to gro und?

Figure 4-1  
Table 4-1  
 Power input 
terminal Supply power according to the rated power 
specifications indicated in the manual (refer to Chapter 9 Specification). 
NFB or fuse There may be a large inrush current during 
power on. Refer to Section 7-2 NFB to select a 
suitable NFB or Section 7-3 Fuse Specification Chart. 
Electromagnetic 
contactor Switching the power ON/OFF on the primary side of the electromagnetic contactor can turn the drive ON/OFF, but frequent switching can cause machine failure. Do not switch ON/OFF more than once an hour.  
Do not use the electromagnetic contactor as the 
power switch for the driv e; doing so shortens the 
life of the drive.  
Refer to Section 7-2 Magnetic Contactor / Air 
Circuit Breaker to select the electromagnetic 
contactor that meets your requirement. 
AC reactor 
(input terminal) When the main power supply capacity is greater 
than 500 kVA, or when it switches into the phase capacitor, the instantaneous peak voltage and current generated may destroy the internal circuit 
of the drive. 
It is recommended that you install an input side 
AC reactor in the drive. This also improves the power factor and reduces power harmonics. The wiring distance should be within 10 m. Refer to 
Section 7-4 AC/DC Reactor for details.  
Zero phase 
reactor Used to reduce radiated interference, especially 
in environments with audio devices, and reduce input and output side interference. 
The effective range is AM band to 10 MHz. Refer 
to Section 7-5 Zero Phase Reactors for details. 
EMC filter Can be used to reduce electromagnetic 
interference. Refer to Section 7-6 EMC Filter for 
details. 
Brake module  
&  
Brake resistor 
(BR) Used to shorten the deceleration time of the 
motor. Refer to Section 7-1 Brake Resistors and 
Brake Units Used in AC Motor Drives for details. 
AC reactor  
(output terminal) The motor cable length affects the size of the 
reflected wave on the motor end. It is 
recommended that you install an AC output 
reactor when the motor wiring length exceeds the value listed in Section 7-4.

  Tighten the screws in the main circuit terminal to prevent sparks caused by screws 
loosened due to vibration. 
 If necessary, use an inductive filter only at the motor output terminals U/T1, V/T2, 
W/T3 of the AC motor drive. DO NOT use phase-compensation capacitors or L-C 
(Inductance-Capacitance) or R-C (Resistance-Capacitance), unless approved by Delta. 
 DO NOT connect phase-compensation capacitors or surge absorbers at the output 
terminals of AC motor drives. 
 DO NOT connect brake resistors directly to +1/DC+ to DC-, +2/B1 to DC- to prevent 
damage to the drive or to the brake resistors. 
 Ensure proper insulation of the main circuit wiring in accordance with the relevant 
safety regulations.
 
 Main input power terminals 
 R/L1, S/L2 and T/L3 have no phase-sequence requirement; they can be connected 
in any sequence. 
 Add a magnetic contactor (MC) to the power input wiring to cut off power quickly 
and reduce malfunctions when the AC motor drive protection function activates. Both ends of the MC should have an R-C surge absorber. 
 Use voltage and current within the specifications in Chapter 09. Refer to Chapter 09 
Specifications for details. 
 Although the leakage current of one single MS300 drive is less than 10
DC mA, 
electric shock may still occur due to the leakage current from other equipment such as motors and leads. Therefore, it is recommended that you install one of the followings to prevent danger caused by electric shock. 1. Use a copper wire with a cross-section of 10 mm
2 or above or an aluminum wire 
of 16 mm2 as the connection between the casing and the ground. 
2. Install an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB). 
 Due to the high frequency current of the leakage current of the AC motor drive, 
select a Type B ELCB specifically for the drive when using an ELCB. For tripping or malfunctions on the usage of ELCB, refer to Section 7-8 Capacitive Filter for details. The power system of the AC motor drive affects the power factor, so select a MCCB with larger capacity. 
 Use shielded wire or conduit for the power wiring and ground the two ends of the 
shielding or conduit. 
 DO NOT run and stop the AC motor drives by turning the power ON and OFF. Run 
and stop the AC motor drives by sendi ng the RUN and STOP commands through 
the control terminals or the keypad. If you still need to run and stop the AC motor drives by turning the power ON and OFF, do so no more often than ONCE per hour. 
 To comply with UL standards, connect the drive to a three-phase three-wire or 
three-phase four-wire Wye system type of mains power system. 
Output terminals of the main circuit 
 Use well-insulated motors to prevent any electric leakage from motors. 
 When the AC drive output terminals U/T1, V/T2, and W/T3 are connected to the 
motor terminals U/T1, V/T2, and W/T3 respectively, the FWD LED indicator on the digital keypad is ON. This means the AC motor drive executes running forward, and the motor rotates counterclockwise (viewed from the shaft end of the motor, as shown in Figure 5-1).

 5-3On the contrary, when the REV LED indicator lights, the AC motor drive executes 
running in reverse, and the motor rotates in an opposite direction to Figure 5-1. If the AC motor drive executes running forward but the motor rotates in a reverse direction, exchange any two of the U/T1, V/T2 and W/T3 motor leads. 
  
Figure 5-1  
Terminals for connecting DC reactor, external brake resistor and DC circuit 
 Use the terminals, as shown in Figure 5-2, to connect a DC reactor to improve the 
power factor and reduce harmonics. A jumper is connected to these terminals at the factory. Remove that jumper before connecting to a DC reactor. 
 Tighten the jumper if a DC reactor is not connected and DC+/+1 and +2/B1 
terminals are used for common DC bus or brake resistors in order to prevent the AC motor drive from losing power and damage to the terminals. If the jumper is missing 
due to wiring, refer to the recommended main circuit terminal wire gauge mentioned in Section 5-2 to short-circuit the DC+/+1 and +2/B1 terminals. 
 
Figure 5-2  
 Install an external brake resistor for applications in frequent deceleration to stop, 
short deceleration time (such as high frequency operation and heavy load operation), too low braking torque, or increased braking torque.
 
 
Figure 5-3  
 Connect the external brake resistor to +2/B1, B2 terminals of the AC motor drives. 
 DO NOT connect two ends of the brake resistor directly to DC+/+1 and DC-, +2/B1 
to DC- to prevent damage to the drive and to the brake resistor. 
 When connecting DC+/+1 and DC- in common DC bus applications, refer to 
Section 5-2 (Main Circuit Terminal Specifications) for the wiring terminal specification and the wire gauge information.

 6-2  Analog input terminals (AVI, ACI, ACM) 
 Analog input signals are easily affected by external noise. Use shielded wiring and 
keep it as short as possible (less than 20 m) with proper grounding. If the noise is 
inductive, connecting the shield to the ACM terminal can reduce interference. 
 Use twisted-pair wire for weak analog signals. 
 If the analog input signals are affected by noise from the AC motor drive, connect a 
capacitor and a ferrite core as shown in Figure 6-1.

Wiring precautions: 
1. The factory default is +24 V DC/S1/S2 short-circuited by jumper, as shown in Area 1 in Figure 6-6.  
Refer to Figure 4-2 in Chapter 4 WIRING for details. 
2. Use the +24 V DC power supply of the safety function (as shown in Area 2 in Figure 6-7) for STO only.  
Do NOT use it for other purposes. 
3. The RELAY terminal uses the PCB terminal block (as shown in Area 3 in Figure 6-6): 
 Tighten the wiring with a 3.5 mm width and 0.6 mm thickness slotted screwdriver. 
 The ideal length of stripped wire at the connection side is 6–7 mm. 
 When wiring bare wires, ensure that they are perfectly arranged to go through the wiring holes. 
4. The Control terminal uses the push-in spring terminal block (as shown in Area 4 in Figure 6-6): 
 Tighten the wiring with a 2.5 mm width and 0.4 mm thickness slotted screwdriver. 
 The ideal length of stripped wire at the connection side is 9 mm. 
 When wiring bare wires, ensure that they are perfectly arranged to go through the wiring holes.

*1 Calculation for 125% brake torque: (kW)*125%*0.8; where 0.8 is motor efficiency. 
Because of the limited resistor power, the longest operation ti me for 10% ED is 10 seconds (ON: 10 sec. / OFF: 90 sec.).  
*2 The calculation of the brake resistor is based on a four-pole motor (1800 rpm).  
*3 For heat dissipation , a resistors of 400 W or lower should be fixed to the frame and maintain the surface temperature 
below 250°C; a resistor of 1000 W and above should maintain the surface temperature below 350°C.  
(If the surface temperature is higher than  the temperature limit, install extra cooli ng or increase the size of the resistor.)

 7-4NOTE 
1. Select the resistance value, power and brake usage (ED %) according to Delta rules.  
Definition for Brake Usage ED% 
 
Figure 7-1-1  
For safety, install a thermal overload relay (O.L) between the brake unit and the brake resistor in 
conjunction with the magnetic contactor (MC) befor e the drive for additional protection. The thermal 
overload relay protects the brake resistor from damag e due to frequent or continuous braking. Under such 
circumstances, turn off the power to prevent dam age to the brake resistor, brake unit and drive.  
NOTE: Never use it to disconnect the brake resistor. 
 
Figure 7-1-2  
2. Any damage to the drive or other equipment caused by  using brake resistors and  brake modules that are 
not provided by Delta voids the warranty. 
3. Consider environmental safety factors when installing the brake resistors. If you use the minimum 
resistance value, consult local dealers for the power calculation. 
4. When using more than two brake units, the equivalent  resistor value of the parallel brake unit cannot be 
less than the value in the column “Min. Resistor Value ( Ω)”. Read the wiring information in the brake unit 
instruction sheet thoroughly prior to operation. Visit the following links to get the instruction sheets for the 
wiring in the brake unit:

5. The selection tables are for normal usage. If the AC motor drive requires frequent braking, increase the 
Watts by two to three times. 
6. Thermal Overload Relay (TOR):  
Thermal overload relay selection is based on its over load capacity. A standard braking capacity of the 
MS300 is 10% ED (Tripping time=10 s). As shown in the figure below, a 460V, 1kw MS300 required the 
thermal relay to take 260% overload capacity for 10 seconds (hot starting) and the braking current is 24A. 
In this case, select a thermal overload relay rated at 10 A (10 * 260% = 26 A > 24 A). The property of each 
thermal relay may vary among different manufacturers . Carefully read the specification before using it.

 7-12 7-4 AC / DC Reactor 
AC Input Reactor 
Installing an AC reactor on the input side of an AC motor drive can increase line impedance, improve 
the power factor, reduce input current, increase system capacity, and reduce interference generated from 
the motor drive. It also reduces momentary voltage surges or abnormal current spikes from the mains power, further protecting the drive. For example, when the main power capacity is higher than 500 kVA, or 
when using a phase-compensation capacitor, momentary voltage and current spikes may damage the AC motor drive’s internal circuit. An AC reactor on the input side of the AC motor drive protects it by 
suppressing surges. 
Install an AC input reactor in series between the main power and the three input phases R S T, as 
shown in the figure below: 
  
Figure 7-4-1  
AC Output Reactor 
When using drives in long wiring output application,  ground fault (GFF), over-current (OC) and motor 
over-voltage (OV) often occur. GFF and OC cause e rrors due to the drive's self-protective mechanism; 
over-voltage damages motor insulation. 
The excessive length of the output wires makes the grounded stray capacitance too large, increase 
the three-phase output common mode current, and the reflected wave of the long wires makes the motor dv / dt and the motor terminal voltage too high. Thus, installing a reactor on the drive’s output side can increases the high-frequency impedance to reduce the dv / dt and terminal voltage to protect the motor. 
Install an AC output reactor in series between the three output phases U V W and the motor, as 
shown in the figure below:

 7-13 DC Reactor 
A DC reactor can also increase line impedance, im prove the power factor, reduce input current, 
increase system power, and reduce interference generated  from the motor drive. A DC reactor stabilizes 
the DC bus voltage. Compared with an AC input reactor, a DC reactor is in smaller size, lower price, and 
lower voltage drop (lower power dissipation). 
Install a DC reactor between terminals +1 and +2. Remove the jumper, as shown in the figure below, 
before installing a DC reactor. 
Note: 115V models have no DC choke.

 7-32 The Motor Cable Length 
1. Consequence of leak age current on the motor 
If the cable length is too long, the stray capacitance between cables increases and may cause 
leakage current. In this case, It activates the over-current protection, increases leakage current, or 
may affect the current display. The worst case is t hat it may damage the AC motor drive. If more than 
one motor is connected to one AC motor drive, the total wiring length should be the sum of the wiring length from AC motor drive to each motor.  
For the 460V models AC motor drive, when you install an overload thermal relay between the 
drive and the motor to protect the motor from overheating, the connecting cable must be shorter than 50 m; however, an overload thermal relay malfunction may still occur. To prevent the malfunction, install an output reactor (optional) to the drive or lower the carrier frequency setting (see Pr.00-17 Carrier Frequency). 
2. Consequence of the su rge voltage on the motor 
When a motor is driven by a PWM-type AC motor drive, the motor terminals experience surge 
voltages (dv/dt) due to power transistor conversion of AC motor drive. When the motor cable is very long (especially for the 460V models), surge voltages (dv/dt) may damage the motor insulation and bearing. To prevent this, follow these rules: 
a. Use a motor with enhanced insulation. 
b. Reduce the cable length between the AC motor drive and motor to suggested values. 
c. Connect an output reactor (optional) to the output terminals of the AC motor drive. 
Refer to the following tables for the suggested motor shielded cable length. For drive models < 
480V, use a motor with a rated voltage ≤  500 V
AC and an insulation level ≥ 1.35 kV p-p in accordance 
with IEC 60034-17. For the 575V drive model, use a motor with a rated voltage ≤ 600 V AC and an 
insulation level ≥ 1.79 kV p-p in accordance with IEC 60034-25.

frequency (Pr.00-17=4). If you use it for > 4 kHz carr ier frequency, you may need to reduce the motor cable 
length to prevent over-current protection caused by large leakage current, depending on the actual on-site 
situations.

 7-35 7-5 Zero Phase Reactors 
You can also suppress interference by installing a zero phase reactor at the main input or the motor 
output of the drive, depending on the location of the interference. Delta provides two types of zero phase 
reactors to solve interference problems. 
A. Casing with mechanical fixed part 
Used for the zero phase reactor at the main input/motor output. It withstands large current load and is 
used for high frequencies. You can get higher impedance by increasing the number of turns.

B. Casing without mechanical fixed part 
Adopts nanocrystalline core developed by VAC○R, and has high initial permeability, high saturation 
induction density, low iron loss and perfect temperature characteristic. If the zero phase reactor does not 
need to be fixed mechanically, use this solution.

 7-36 Installation 
During installation, pass the cable through at least one zero phase reactor. Use a suitable cable type 
(pressure endurance, current endurance, insulation class, and wire gauge) so that the cable passes 
easily through the zero phase reactor. Do not pass the grounding cable through the zero phase reactor; only pass the motor wire and power cable through the zero phase reactor. With longer motor cables the zero-phase reactor can effectively reduce interference at the motor output. Moreover, pay extra attention to the large leakage current due to long cable length. This may cause temperature rise in the zero phase reactor. Install the zero phase reactor as close to the output of the drive as possible. Figure 7-5-3 below shows the installation diagram for a single turn zero phase reactor. If the wire diameter allows several turns, Figure 7-5-4 shows the installation of a multi-turn zero phase reactor. The more turns, the better the noise suppression effect. 
 
Figure 7-5-3 Single turn wiring diagram for shielding wire with a zero phase reactor  
  
Figure 7-5-4 Multi-turn zero phase reactor  
Installation Precaution 
Install the zero phase reactor at the drive’s output terminal (U/T1, V/T2, W/T3). After the zero phase 
reactor is installed, it reduces the electromagnetic radiation and load stress emitted by the wiring of the 
drive. The number of zero phase reactors required for the drive depends on the wiring length and the drive voltage. 
The normal operating temperature of the zero phase reactor should be lower than 85°C (176°F). 
However, when the zero phase reactor is saturated, its temperature may exceed 85°C (176°F). In this case, increase the number of zero phase reactors to avoid saturation. The following are reasons that might cause saturation of the zero phase reactors: the drive wiring is too long; the drive has several sets of loads; the wiring is in parallel; or the drive uses high capacitance wiring. If the temperature of the zero phase reactor exceeds 85°C (176°F) during the operation of the drive, increase the number of zero phase reactors.

Use EMC filters to enhance the EMC performance for the environment and machines and to comply 
with EMC regulations, further reducing EMC problems.  If you purchase a motor drive without a built-in 
EMC filter, it is recommended that you select the EMC filters as shown below. For some motor drive 
models, you need to work with zero phase reactors to be compliant with EMC regulations. Refer to the table and figure below for the recommended model, setting method, and maximum motor cable length of the EMC filter and zero phase reactor.

 7-62 7-13 Mounting Adapter Plate 
The mounting adapter plate is to change the wiring method for the ME300/MS300/MH300 series to 
provide you a flexible installation. It changes the wiring method from the “bottom-mains input/ 
bottom-motor output" to the “top-mains input/bottom-motor output" for ME300/MS300/MH300. Therefore, you can use the mounting adapter plate to change the drive from VFD-E/VFD-EL series to ME300/ MS300/MH300 series without changing the original  wiring method and fixing hole. The following table 
shows the correspondences.

 10-6 Follow the process below to set the user-defined application selection (Pr.13-00=1). 
           
1. Use Pr.13-01–Pr.13-50 to set the user-defined parameters in sequence according to your 
requirement. The default setting 0.00 means there is no user-defined parameter. Press ENTER to set the corresponding parameters for Pr.13-01– Pr.13-50. 
2. The setting method of user-defined parameters is the same as that for non-user-defined 
parameters. You can use Up and Down keys or left shift key to speed up the settings. Example:  Setting Pr.13-01 to the user-defined parameter 04-00. First, press ENTER at Pr.13-01 to enter the setting page. Then, long press MODE to enable the left shif t key to start the setting. The 
setting process shows as follows. 
 
NOTEYou must set Pr.13-01, 02……50 in sequence, or the display shows  “Err”. 
3. After finishing the setting, press MODE to return to the APP page, and then press ENTER. The 
keypad displays “USEr”. After you press ENTER again, the corres ponding parameter that you 
set appears. Example:  If you set Pr.13-01 as the user-defined parameter Pr.04-00, and Pr.13-02 as Pr.04-01, the parameters you set appear when you press ENTER at the “USEr” pa ge. 
 
 
 
 Set Pr.13-00=1 to enable the 
user-defined application selection. Set Pr.13-01–Pr.13-50 user-defined parameters in sequence. (If Pr.13-00≠1, the setting is 
invalid.) After finishing setting, press 
MODE to display the APP page, and then press ENTER to display the USEr page. Press ENTER again to display the user-defined 
parameters. 
Use Up and Down keys to 
select the user-defined 
parameters, and press ENTER to check and set the setting. To change a user-defined parameter, return to Pr.13-01–Pr.13-50 to modify the setting value. To remove a user-defined parameter, return to Pr.13-01–Pr.13-50 and set the parameters as 0.00 from the last defined parameter in sequence.

 10-7 4. To remove a set user-defined parameter, remove from the last defined parameter (set to 0.00) 
first, or the display shows “Err”. For example, if there are five user-defined parameters (Pr.13-01, 
13-02…13-05), to remove Pr.13-02, you must remove Pr.13-05 firs t, then 13-04, then 13-03, 
and then 13-02. 
  
D. Parameter setting 
D-1. Unsigned parameter 
(Parameter setting range ≥  0; for example, Pr.01-00)  
1. Without using the left shift key: Use Up and Left/Down key t o select and adjust the parameters. 
Then, press ENTER to start the parameter settings. 
2. Using the left shift key: Long press MODE for two seconds un til the last digit of the parameter 
value starts to blink. Increase the value by pressing the Up ke y. The value goes back to 0 after 
9. 
3. Press left/down key to shift the blinking cursor one digit to the left, and increase the value by 
pressing the Up key. 
4. After you finish setting the parameter, the left shift key function is not disabled automatically until 
you disable it manually by pressing MODE for two seconds. 
Example:  
The default setting for Pr.01-00 is 60.00. Long pressing MODE for two seconds enables the left shift function. The process for pressing the Left/Down key shows as follows:
 
 
The upper limit for Pr.01-00 is 599.00. If you set a value grea ter than 599.00, “Err” appears after 
you press ENTER, and then the keypad shows the upper limit (599.00) for a second to remind you of the incorrect setting. The setting value remains as the original set value and the cursor 
returns to the last digit.
 
D-2. Minus-signed parameter setting status 1 
(Parameter setting range can be < 0; for example, Pr.03-03)  
1. Without using the left shift key: Use Up and Left/Down key t o select and adjust the parameters. 
Then, press ENTER to start the parameter settings. 
2. Using the left shift key: Long press MODE for two seconds un til the last digit of the parameter 
value starts to blink. Increase the value by pressing the Up ke y. The value goes back to 0 after 
9. 
3. Press left/down key to shift the blinking cursor one digit to the left, and increase the value by 
pressing the Up key. When you shift to the first digit and pres s the Up key, the digit “0” changes 
to “-” (minus).

 10-8 Example:  
The default setting for Pr.03-03 is 0.0. Long pressing MODE for two seconds enables the left shift function. The process for pressing the Left/Down key shows as follows: 
 
The upper limit for Pr.03-03 is 100.0 and lower limit is -100.0 . If you set a value greater than 
100.0 or less than -100.0, “Err” appears after you press ENTER,  and then the keypad shows the 
upper limit (100.0) or lower limit (-100.0) for a second to rem ind you of the incorrect setting. The 
setting value remains as the original set value, and the cursor returns to the last digit. 
D-3. Minus-signed parameter setting status 2 
(Parameter setting range can be < 0, and the lower limit is ≤ - 100.00 with two decimal 
places; for example, Pr.03-74) 
1. Without using the left shift key: Use Up and Left/Down key t o select and adjust the parameters. 
Then, press ENTER to start the parameter settings. 
2. Using the left shift key: Long press MODE for two seconds un til the last digit of the parameter 
value starts to blink. Increase the value by pressing the Up ke y. The value goes back to 0 after

3. Press the left/down key to shift the blinking cursor one dig it to the left, and increase the value by 
pressing the Up key. When you shift to the first digit and pres s the Up key, the digit “0” changes 
to “-” (minus). 
4. For parameter values with three digits and two decimal places and a positive/negative setting 
range (Pr.03-74, -100.00–100.00%), the keypad only displays four digits (-100.0 or 100.0). Example:  The default setting for Pr.03-74 is -100.0. If you increase the parameter value by 0.01, the display shows -99.99, with four digits only. Long pressing MODE for two seconds enables the left shift function. The process for pressing the Left/Down key shows as follows: 
 
The upper limit for Pr.03-74 is 100.00 and lower limit is -100.00. If you set a value greater 
than 100.0 or less than -100.0, “Err” appears after you press E NTER, and then the keypad 
shows the upper limit (100.0) or lower limit (-100.0) (only one  decimal place is displayed) for a 
second to remind you of the incorrect setting. The setting value remains as the original set value, and the cursor returns to the last digit.

 From the table, you see that the PWM carrier frequency has significant influences on the 
electromagnetic noise, the AC motor drive heat dissipation, and the motor acoustic noise. Therefore, if the surrounding noise is greater than the motor noise, lower the carrier frequency to reduce the temperature rise. Although the motor has quiet operation in the higher carrier frequency, consider the entire wiring and interference. 
 When the carrier frequency is higher than the default, decrease the carrier frequency to protect 
the drive. Refer to Pr.06-55 for the related setting and details.

The displayed units for the control frequency F page, user-defined (Pr.00-04 = d10, PID feedback) and Pr.00-26. 
 
 You must convert the setting value to decimal when using the keypad to set parameters. 
Example: Assume that the user-defined unit is inWG and user-defined decimal place is the third 
decimal point. According to the information above, the corresponding unit to inWG is 01Axh (x is the set decimal point), and the corresponding unit to the third decimal place is 0003h, then inWG and the third de cimal point displayed in hexadecimal is

 When Pr.00-26 is NOT set to 0, the user-defined value is enabled. After selecting the displayed 
unit and number of decimal places with Pr.00-25, the setting value of Pr.00-26 corresponds to Pr.01-00 (drive ’s maximum operating frequency). 
Example: When the frequency set in Pr.01-00 = 60.00 Hz, the maximum user-defined value for 
Pr.00-26 is 100.0%. This also means that Pr.00-25 is set at 33 (0021h) to select % as the unit. 
Note: Set Pr.00-25 before using Pr.00-26. After you finish setting, when Pr.00-26 is not 0, the 
displayed unit on the keypad shows correctly according to Pr.00-25 settings.

 You usually set the V/F curve according to the motor’s allowable loading characteristics. Pay 
special attention to the motor’s heat dissipation, dynamic balance, and bearing lubrication when 
the loading characteristics exceed the loading limit of the motor. 
 There is no limit for the voltage setting, but a high voltage at a low frequency may cause motor 
damage, overheating, and trigger the stall prevention or the ov er-current protection; therefore, 
use low voltage at low frequency to prevent motor damage or dri ve error. 
 The diagram below shows the V/F curve for motor 1. You can use  the same V/F curve for motor 2, 
motor 3, and motor 4. For multi-motor selections, refer to the multi-function input terminal (Pr.02-01–Pr.02-07) settings 83 and 84.

time (Pr.01-20, Pr.01-21) are the time to accelerate from 0.00 Hz to the JOG frequency (Pr.01-22). 
You cannot execute the JOG command when the AC motor drive is r unning. When the JOG 
command is executing, other operation commands are invalid.

 This function does not require the external terminal switching function; it switches the 
acceleration and deceleration time automatically according to t he Pr.01-23 setting. If you set the 
external terminal, the external terminal has priority over Pr.0 1.23. 
 When using this function, set the S-curve acceleration time to  0 if the fourth acceleration time is 
short. 
a. If Pr.01-02=10 s, Pr. 01-18=6 s, then the acceleration time is 3 s for 0–40 Hz and 5 s for

and you can combine them. Pr.01-28 does not need to be greater than Pr.01-29; Pr.01-30 does 
not need to be greater than Pr.01-31; Pr.01-32 does not need to  be greater than Pr.01-33. You 
can set Pr.01-28–01-33 as you required. There is no size  distinction among these six parameters.  
 These parameters set the skip frequency ranges for the AC motor drive. You can use this function 
to avoid frequencies that cause mechanical resonance. The skip frequencies are useful when a 
motor has resonance vibration at a specific frequency bandwidth . Skipping this frequency avoids 
the vibration. There are three frequency skip zones available.

 If the load of the motor is a variable torque load (torque is in direct proportion to the rotating 
speed, such as the load of a fan or a pump), the load torque is  low at low rotating speed. You can 
decrease the input voltage appropriately to make the magnetic field of the input current smaller 
and reduce flux loss and iron loss for the motor to increase ef ficiency. 
 When you set the V/F curve to high power, it has lower torque at low frequency, and the drive is 
not suitable for rapid acceleration and deceleration. Do NOT us e this parameter for rapid 
acceleration and deceleration.

acceleration and deceleration to effectively reduce the mechani cal vibration during the load 
start-up and stop and make the auto-tuning process more easier.  It does not stall during 
acceleration and does not need a brake resistor during decelera tion to stop. It can also improve

If the drive is in stop status, enable this terminal to make the drive enter the fire mode to force the drive to run according to Pr.06-80 settings. (Refer to Pr.06-80, 06-81, 06-88 for details) 
59 Enable fire mode (without RUN command) When fire occurs, enable this terminal to make the drive enter the fire mode. If the drive is in stop status, enable this terminal to make the drive enter the fire mode, but the drive does not run. If the drive is in running status, enable this terminal to run the drive according to Pr.06-80 settings. (Refer to Pr.06-80, 06-81, 06-88 for details) 
70 Force auxiliary frequency return to 0 Forces the auxiliary frequency return to 0 when using this 
function. PID keeps operating if PID is the master frequency. When Pr.00-35 ≠ 0, the master and auxiliary frequencies are 
enabled, and then selecting this function with the terminal effectively forces the auxiliary frequency return to 0. 
71 Disable PID function, 
force PID output return to 0 When the master and auxiliary frequencies are enabled and when using the PID function, ON: PID does not operate, returns the integral value to 0, and forces the PID output return to 0. 
72 Disable PID function, retain the output value before disabled When the master and auxiliary frequencies are enabled, and the PID function is enabled, ON: PID does not operate, and its output value remains the same as the value before it was disabled. 
73 Force PID integral gain return to 0, disable integral ON: PID continues to operate, disables the integral control, and returns the integral value to 0. 
74 Reverse PID feedback  ON: PID negative feedback becomes positive feedback, or PID positive feedback becomes negative feedback. 
81 Simple positioning zero point position signal input Use this function as the trigger terminal for simple positioning with Pr.02-78–Pr.02-80. This function is just a simple positioning, so you must verify the positioning accuracy. Refer to Pr.02-80 for details. 
82 OOB loading balance detection You can use the OOB (Out Of Balance Detection) function with  the PLC program in the washing machine system. ON: it receives the Δθ  value according to Pr.07-46 (OOB Sampling 
Time) and Pr.07-47

 12.1-03-1 03 Analog Input / Output Parameters        You can set this parameter during operation. 
  Analog Input Selection (AVI) 
     Default: 1 
  Analog Input Selection (ACI) 
     Default: 0 
  Settings 0: No function       
  1: Frequency command      
  2: Torque command (torque limit under speed mode)      
  3: Torque compensation command       
  4: PID target value      
  5: PID feedback signal      
  6: Thermistor (PTC) input value      
  7: Positive torque limit      
  8: Negative torque limit      
  9: Regenerative torque limit      
  10: Positive / negative torque limit      
  11: PT100 thermistor input value      
  12: Auxiliary frequency input      
  13: PID compensation value      
 When you use analog input as the PID reference target input, you must set Pr.00-20 to 2 
(external analog input). 
Setting method 1: Pr.03-00–03-01 set 1 as PID reference target input. Setting method 2: Pr.03-00–03-01 set 4 as PID reference target input. 
If the setting value 1 and setting value 4 exist at the same time, the AVI input has highest priority to become the PID reference target input value.
 
 When you use analog input as the PID compensation value, you must set Pr.08-16 to 1 (source of 
PID compensation value is analog input). You can see the compensation value with Pr.08-17. 
 When using the Frequency command, the corresponding value for 0–10 V / 4–20 mA is 
0–maximum operation frequency (Pr.01-00). 
 When using the torque command, the corresponding value for 0–10 V / 4–20 mA is 0–maximum 
output torque (Pr.11-27). 
 When using torque compensation, the corresponding value for 0–10 V / 4–20 mA is 0–the motor’s 
rated torque. 
 If the settings for Pr.03-00–Pr.03-01 are the same, the AVI input has priority over the ACI input. 
  Analog Input Bias (AVI) 
          Default: 0

 12.1-03-2   Analog Input Bias (ACI) 
          Default: 0 
  Settings -100.0–100.0 % 
 Sets the corresponding ACI current for the external analog input 0. 
  Positive / Negative Bias Mode (AVI) 
  Positive / Negative Bias Mode (ACI) 
          Default: 0 
  Settings 0: No bias 
   1: Lower than or equal to bias 
   2: Greater than or equal to bias 
   3: The absolute value of the bias voltage while serving as the center  
   4: Bias serves as the center 
 Using negative bias to set the frequency greatly reduces the noise interference. In a noisy 
environment, do NOT use signals less than 1 V to set the drive’s operation frequency. 
  Reverse Setting when Analog Signal Input is Negative Frequency  
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Negative frequency input is not allowed. The digital keypad or external 
terminal controls the forward and reverse direction. 
   1: Negative frequency input is allowed. Positive frequency = run in a forward 
direction; negative frequency = run in a reverse direction. The digital 
keypad or external terminal control cannot change the running direction.  
 Use this parameter only for AVI or ACI analog input. 
 Requirements for negative frequency (reverse running) 
1. Pr.03-10 = 1 2. Bias mode = Bias serves as the center 3. Corresponded analog input gain < 0 (negative); this makes the input frequency negative. 
In using the analog input addition function (Pr.03-18=1), when the analog signal is negative after the addition, you can set this parameter to allow or not allow the reverse running. The result after adding depends on the “Requirements for negative frequency (reverse running)”.

 12.1-06-1 06 Protection Parameters (1)                 You can set this parameter during operation.  
  Low Voltage Level 
    Default: 180.0 / 360.0 / 450.0 
  Settings  115V / 230V series: 150.0–220.0 V DC   
   460V series:: 300.0–440.0 V DC   
   575V series:: 375.0–550.0 V DC  
 Sets the Low Voltage (LV) level. When the DC bus voltage is lower than Pr.06-00, a LV fault is 
triggered, and the drive stops output then the motor coasts to a stop. 
 If the LV fault is triggered during operation, the drive stops output and the motor coasts to a stop. 
There are three LV faults, LvA (LV during acceleration), Lvd (LV during deceleration), and Lvn (LV 
in constant speed) that are triggered according to the status of acceleration or deceleration. You must press RESET to clear the LV fault. The drive automatically restarts if set to restart after momentary power loss (refer to Pr.07-06 Restart after Momentary Power Loss and Pr.07-07 Allowed Power Loss Duration for details). 
 If the LV fault is triggered when the drive is in STOP status, the drive displays LvS (LV during 
stop), which is not recorded, and the drive restarts automatically when the input voltage is higher than the LV level of 30 V (230V series), 60 V (460V series) or 75V (575 series). 
 
  Over-voltage Stall Prevention 
  Settings 0: Disabled                                Default: 380.0 / 760.0 / 975.0 
   115V / 230V: 0.0–390.0 V DC 
   460V: 0.0–780.0 V DC 
   575V: 0.0–1000.0 V DC 
 Setting Pr.06-01 to 0.0 disables the over-voltage stall prevention function (connected with braking 
unit or brake resistor). Use this setting when braking units or brake resistors are connected to the drive. 
 Setting Pr.06-01 to a value > 0.0 enables the over-voltage stall prevention. This setting refers to 
the power supply system and loading. If the setting is  too low, then over-voltage stall prevention is 
easily activated, which may increase deceleration time. 
 Related parameters: 
Pr.01-13, Pr.01-15, Pr.01-17, Pr.01-19 Deceleration Time 1–4, Pr.02-13 Multi-function Output 1 (Relay 1), Pr.02-16–Pr.02-17 Multi-function Output 2–3 (MO1, MO2), and Pr.06-02 Selection for Over-voltage Stall Prevention.

 12.1-06-2   Selection for Over-voltage Stall Prevention  
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Traditional over-voltage stall prevention 
   1: Smart over-voltage stall prevention 
 Use this function when you are unsure about the load inertia. When stopping under normal load, 
the over-voltage does not occur during deceleration and meet the deceleration time setting. 
Sometimes it may not stop due to over-voltage during decelerating to STOP when the load regenerative inertia increases. In this case, the AC motor drive extends the deceleration time automatically until the drive stops. 
 When you set Pr.06-02 to 0, during deceleration the motor exceeds the synchronous speed due 
to load inertia. In this case, the motor becomes an electrical generator. The DC bus voltage may exceed its maximum allowable value due to motor regeneration in some situations, such as motor’s loading inertia being too high or drive’s deceleration time being set too short. When you enable traditional over-voltage stall prevention and the DC bus voltage detected is too high, the drive stops decelerating (output frequency remains unchanged) until the DC bus voltage drops below the setting value.  
 
 When you set Pr.06-02 to 1 to use smart over-voltage stall prevention during deceleration, the 
drive maintains the DC bus voltage when decelerating and prevents the drive from OV.

 12.1-06-3  When you enable the over-voltage stall prevention, the drive’s deceleration time is longer than 
the setting. If you encounter any problem with the deceleration time, refer to the following guides 
for troubleshooting. 
1. Increase the deceleration time to a proper value. 2. Install a brake resistor (refer to Section 7-1 Brake Resistors and Brake Units Used in AC 
Motor Drives for details) to dissipate the electrical energy that is generated from the motor.

  Over-current Stall Prevention during Acceleration 
    Default: 120 / 180 
  Settings Normal load: 0–150%  
(100% corresponds to the rated current of the drive) 
   Heavy load: 0–200%  
(100% corresponds to the rated current of the drive) 
 In heavy load (Pr.00-16=1), if the DC voltage is higher than the 875 V DC (575V series), 700 V DC 
(460V series) or 350 V DC (230 series), the maximum value for Pr.06-03 is 185%.  
 If the motor load is too large or the drive’s acceleration time is too short, the output current of the 
drive may be too high during acceleration, and it may cause motor damage or trigger the drive’s protection functions (OL or OC). Use this parameter to prevent these situations. 
 During acceleration, the output current of the drive may increase abruptly and exceed the setting 
value of Pr.06-03. In this case, the drive stops accelerating and keeps the output frequency constant, and then continues to accelerate until the output current decreases. 
 When you enable the over-current stall prevention, the drive’s acceleration time is longer than the 
setting. 
 When the over-current stall prevention occurs because the motor capacity is too small or 
operates in the default, decrease the Pr.06-03 setting value. 
 If you encounter any problem with the acceleration time, refer to the following guides for 
troubleshooting. 
1. Increase the deceleration time to a proper value. 2. Set Pr.01-44 Auto-Acceleration and Auto-Deceleration Setting to 1, 3 or 4. 
(auto-acceleration) 
3. Related parameters: Pr.01-12, 01-14, 01-16, 01-18 (Acceleration Time 1–4), Pr.01-44

 This is a protection for the drive to decrease output frequency automatically when the motor 
overloads abruptly during constant motor operation. 
 If the output current exceeds the setting value for Pr.06-04 when the drive is operating, the drive 
decelerates according to the Pr.06-05 setting to prevent the motor from stalling. If the output 
current is lower than the setting value for Pr.06-04, the drive accelerates (according to Pr.06-05) again to the setting frequency.

        Default: 2 
  Settings 0: Inverter motor (with external forced cooling) 
   1: Standard motor (motor with fan on the shaft) 
   2: Disable 
 Prevents self-cooled motor from overheating under low speed. Use an electronic thermal relay to 
limit the drive’s output power. 
 Setting the parameter to 0 is suitable for an inverter motor (motor fan using an independent 
power supply). For this kind of motor, there is no significant  correlation between cooling capacity 
and motor speed. Therefore, the action of electronic thermal relays remains stable in low speed 
to ensure the load capability of the motor in low speed. 
 Setting the parameter to 1 is suitable for standard motor (motor fan is fixed on the rotor shaft). For 
this kind of motor, the cooling capacity is lower in low speed; therefore, the action of an electronic thermal relay reduces the action time to ensure the life of motor. 
 When the power is cycled frequently, if the power is switched OFF, the electronic thermal relay 
protection is reset; therefore, even setting the parameter to 0 or 1 may not protect the motor well. If there are several motors connected to one drive, install an electronic thermal relay in each motor. 
  Electronic Thermal Relay Action Time 1 (Motor 1) 
  Electronic Thermal Relay Action Time 2 (Motor 2) 
        Default: 60.0

 Set the parameter to 150% of motor rated current and use with the setting of Pr.06-14 and 
Pr.06-28 to prevent motor damage due to overheating. When it reaches the setting, the drive displays “EoL1 / EoL2”, and the motor coasts to stop. 
 Use this parameter to set the action time of the electronic thermal relay. It works based on the I2t 
characteristic curve of electronic thermal relay, the output frequency and current of the drive, and the operation time to prevent the motor from overheating.

 12.1-06-8  The action of the electronic thermal relay depends on the settings for Pr.06-13 and Pr.06-27. 
1. Pr.06-13 or Pr.06-27 is set to 0 (using inverter motor): 
When the output current of the drive is higher than 150% of the motor rated current (refer to 
the motor rated current % corresponded to the motor rated frequency in the motor cooling curve with independent fan), the drive starts to count the time. The electronic thermal relay acts when the accumulated time exceeds Pr.06-14 or Pr.06-28. 
2. Pr.06-13 or Pr.06-27 is set to 1 (using standard motor): 
When the output current of the drive is higher than 150% of the motor rated current (refer to the motor rated current % corresponded to the motor rated frequency in the motor cooling curve with shaft-fixed fan), the drive starts to count the time. The electronic thermal relay acts when the accumulated time exceeds Pr.06-14 or Pr.06-28. The actual electronic thermal relay action time adjusts according to the drive output current (shown as the motor loading rate %). The action time is short when the current is high, and the action time is long when the current is low. Refer to the following diagram.
 
 
  Temperature Level Overheat (OH) Warning 
        Default: Depending on the

Pr.06-15 setting, the oH1 fault displays and the warning remains but it does not affect the drive operation. 
 Use this parameter to check the motor overheat in advance in order to take
 precautionary  
measures to decrease the temperature and maintain the motor’s normal operation. 
 If you set the temperature 5ºC higher than the maximum setting value for Pr.06-15, IGBT

Take the standard PTC thermistor as an example: if the protection level is 1330 Ω, the actual 
voltage between +10V-ACM is 10.5 V and divider resistance R1 is 4.4k Ω. 
 
Refer to the following calculation when Pr.06-30 is set to 23% and motor temperature overheating 
protection level is 1330 Ω: 
1330//20000 = (1330*20000) / (1330+20000) = 1247.07 10.5 * 1247.07 / (4400+1247.07) = 2.32 (V) ≒ 2.3 (V) 
Pr.06-30  = 2.3 / 10 V * % = 23%

Chapter 12 Descriptions of Parameter Settings MS300  
 12.1-06-21 Refer to the Section 9-7 Derating for Ambient Temperature, Altitude and Carrier Frequency for the 
carrier frequency derating level.  
Take VFD9A0MS43ANSAA in normal load as an example: ambient temperature 50°C, UL 
open-type, and independent installation. When the carrier frequency is set to 10 kHz, it corresponds to 55% of the rated output current. In the same condition for ambient temperature 40°C, it corresponds to 75% of rated output current. When the output current is higher than this value, it automatically decreases the carrier frequency according to the ambient temperature, output current and overload time. At this time, the overload capacity of the drive is 150% of the rated current. 
 Setting 1:  
When the operating point exceeds the derating curve 1, the carrier frequency is the setting 
value. Select this mode if the change of carrier frequency and motor noise caused by ambient temperature and frequent overload are not allowed. (Refer to Pr.00-17.) 
Refer to Section 9-7 Derating for Ambient Temperature, Altitude and Carrier Frequency  for 
the rated current derating level. Take VFD9A0MS43ANSAA in normal load as an example. If you need to maintain the carrier frequency at 10 kHz, decrease the rated current to 55%. The OL protection executes when the current is 120% * 55% = 66% for one minute; therefore, you must operate using the values within the derating curve to keep the carrier frequency constant. 
 Setting 2:  
The protection method and action are the same as setting value 0, but it disables the current 
limit when output current is the derating ratio ×120% (default value) in normal load and when the output current is the derating ratio ×180% (default value) in heavy load.  The advantage is that it provides a higher starting output current when the carrier frequency setting is higher than the default. However, the carrier frequency derates easily when it overloads.  Example: when Pr.06-55 = 0 or 1, over-current stall prevention level = Ratio * Pr.06-03. When Pr.06-55 = 2, the over-current stall prevention level = Pr.06-03. 
 Use this parameter with Pr.00-16 and Pr.00-17. 
 The ambient temperature also affects the derating. Refer to Section 9-7-1 Derating Curve for 
Ambient Temperature and Altitude. 
Take VFD9A0MS43ANSAA in normal load as an example: ambient temperature 50°C, UL 
open-type, and independent installation. When the carrier frequency is set to 10 kHz, it corresponds to 55% of the rated output current. If used for ambient temperature 60°C, it corresponds to 55% * 75% of the rated output current.

 12.1-06-22   PT100 Level 1 Frequency Protection 
        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 Hz 
  PT100 Activation Level 1 Protection Frequency Delay Time 
        Default: 60  
  Settings 0–6000 sec. 
 PT100 operation instructions 
1. Use voltage type analog input (AVI, ACI voltage 0–10 V) and select PT100 mode. 
2. Select one of the voltage type analog inputs below:  
(a) Pr.03-00 =11, (b) Pr.03-01 = 11 and Pr.03-29 = 1 
3. When selecting Pr.03-01 = 11 and Pr.03-29 = 1, you must switch AFM to 0–10 V. 4. The AFM outputs constant voltage or current, then Pr.03-20 = 23. You must switch ACM to 
0–20 mA, and set AFM output level to 45% (Pr.03-32 = 45%) of 20 mA = 9 mA. 
5. Use Pr.03-32 to adjust the constant voltage or constant current of the AFM output; the 
setting range is 0.00–100.00%.
 
6. There are two types of action levels for PT100. The diagram below shows the PT100 
protection action.  
 
 When Pr.06-58 = 0.00 Hz, PT100 function is disabled. 
Case: When using PT100, if the motor temperature is higher than 135°C (275 °F), the drive starts to 
count the delay time for auto-deceleration (Pr.06-59). The drive decreases the motor frequency to the setting for Pr.06-58 when it reaches the delay time count value. The drive operates at the frequency set for Pr.06-58 until the motor temperature is lower than 135°C (275 °F). If the motor 
temperature is higher than 150°C (302 °F), the drive automatically decelerates to STOP and 
displays the warning “oH3”.

 12.1-06-23 Set up process:  
1. Switch AFM to 0–20 mA on the control board.  
2. Wiring: 
Connect external terminal AFM to “+” Connect external terminal ACM to “-“  Connect AFM and AVI to “short circuit” 
3. Pr.03-00 = 11, Pr.03-20 = 23, Pr.03-32 = 45% (9 mA) 4. Refer to the RTD temperature and resistance comparison table 
Temperature = 135°C, resistance = 151.71 Ω , input current: 9 mA, voltage: about 1.37 V
DC 
Temperature = 150°C, resistance = 157.33 Ω , input current: 9 mA, voltage: about 1.42 V DC 
5. When the RTD temperature > 135°C, the drive decelerates to the specified operation 
frequency automatically. Then, Pr.06-56 = 1.37 V and Pr.06-58 = 10 Hz. (When Pr.06-58 = 0, it disables the specified operation frequency.) 
6. When RTD temperature > 150°C, the drive outputs a fault, decelerates to STOP, and 
displays the warning “oH3”. Then, Pr.06-57 = 1.42 V and Pr.06-29 = 1 (fault and ramp to stop). 

 12.1-07-1 07 Special Parameters                     You can set this parameter during operation. 
  Software Brake Chopper Action Level 
        Default: 370.0 / 740.0 / 950.0 
  Settings 115V / 230V models : 350.0–450.0 V DC                             
   460V models : 700.0–900.0 V DC 
   575V models : 875.0–1000.0 V DC 
 Sets the DC bus voltage at which the brake chopper is activated. Choose a suitable brake 
resistor to achieve the optimal deceleration performance. Refer to Chapter 7 Optional 
Accessories for information about brake resistors.
  DC Brake Current Level  
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0–100% 
 Sets the level of the DC brake current output to the motor at start-up and stop. When setting the 
DC brake current, the rated current (Pr.00-01) is 100%. It is recommended that you start with a low DC brake current level and then increase until you reach the proper holding torque. However, the DC brake current cannot exceed the motor’s rated current to prevent the motor from burnout. Therefore, DO NOT use the DC brake for mechanical retention, otherwise injury or accident may occur.
 DC Brake Time at Start-up 
        Default: 0.0 
  Settings 0.0–60.0 sec. 
 The motor may continue rotating due to external forces or the inertia of the motor itself. If you use 
the drive with the motor rotating, it may cause motor damage or trigger drive protection due to over-current. This parameter outputs DC current, generating torque to force the motor stop to get a stable start before motor operation. This parameter determines the duration of the DC brake current output to the motor when the drive starts up. Set this parameter to 0.0 to disable the DC brake at start-up. 
  DC Brake Time at STOP 
        Default: 0.0 
  Settings 0.0–60.0 sec. 
 The motor may continue rotating after the drive stops output due to external forces or the inertia 
of the motor itself. This parameter outputs DC current, generating torque to force the motor stop after the drive stops output to make sure that the motor stops. 
 This parameter determines the duration of the DC Brake current output to the motor when 
braking. To enable the DC brake at STOP, you must set Pr.00-22 (Stop Method) to 0 (ramp to stop). Set this parameter to 0.0 to disable the DC brake at stop. 
 Related parameters: Pr.00-22 Stop Method, Pr.07-04 DC Brake Frequency at STOP.

 12.1-07-2   DC Brake Frequency at STOP 
        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 0 Hz 
 Determines the start frequency of the DC brake before the drive ramps to stop. When this setting 
is less than Pr.01-09 (Start-up Frequency), the start frequency for the DC brake begins at the 
minimum frequency. 
 
 Use the DC brake before running the motor when the load is movable at stop, such as with fans 
and pumps. The motor is in free running status and in unknown rotation direction before the drive starts up. Execute the DC brake before you start the motor. 
 Use the DC Brake at STOP when you need to brake the motor quickly or to control the positioning, 
such as with cranes or cutting machines. 
 Voltage Increasing Gain 
        Default: 100 
  Settings 1–200% 
 When using speed tracking, adjust Pr.07-05 to slow down the increasing voltage gain if there are 
errors such as oL or oc; however, the speed tracking time will be longer. 
  Restart after Momentary Power Loss 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Stop operation 
   1: Speed tracking by the speed before the power loss 
   2: Speed tracking by the minimum output frequency 
 Determines the operation mode when the drive restarts from a momentary power loss. 
 The power system connected to the drive may power off momentarily for many reasons. This 
function allows the drive to keep outputting voltages after the drive is repowered and does not cause the drive to stop. 
 1: Frequency tracking begins before momentary power loss and accelerates to the master 
Frequency command after the drive output frequency and motor rotator speed are synchronous.  Use this setting when there is a lot of inertia with little resistance on the motor load. For example, in equipment with a large inertia flywheel, there is NO need to wait until the flywheel stops completely after a restart to execute the operation command; therefore, it saves time.

 12.1-07-3  2: Frequency tracking starts from the minimum output frequency and accelerates to the master 
Frequency command after the drive output frequency and motor rotator speed are synchronous. 
Use this setting when there is little inertia and large resistance. 
 In PG control mode, the AC motor drive executes the speed tracking function automatically 
according to the PG speed when this setting is NOT set to 0. 
  Allowed Power Loss Duration 
        Default: 2.0 
  Settings 0.0–20.0 sec. 
 Determines the maximum time of allowable power loss. If the duration of a power loss exceeds 
this parameter setting, the AC motor drive stops output after the power recovers. 
 Pr.07-06 is valid when the maximum allowable power loss time is ≤ 20 seconds and the AC motor 
drive displays “LU”. If the AC motor drive is powered off due to overload, even if the maximum 
allowable power loss time is ≤ 20 seconds, Pr.07-06 is invalid after the power recovers. 
  Base Block Time 
        Default: 0.5 
  Settings 0.0–60.0  sec. 
 When momentary power loss is det ected, the AC motor drive blocks its output and then waits for 
a specified period of time (determined by Pr.07-08, called Base Block Time) before resuming 
operation. Set this parameter to the time that allows the residual voltage at the output side to decrease to 0 V before activating the drive again.

  Current Limit of Speed Tracking 
        Default: 100 
  Settings 20–200% 
 The AC motor drive executes speed tracking only when the output current is greater than the 
value set in Pr.07-09. 
 The maximum current for speed tracking affects the synchronous time. The larger the parameter 
setting, the faster the synchronization occurs. However, if the parameter setting is too large, the 
overload protection function may be activated. 

 12.1-07-5   Restart after Fault Action 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Stop operation 
   1: Speed tracking by current speed 
   2: Speed tracking by minimum output frequency 
 In PG control mode, the AC motor drive executes the speed tracking function automatically 
according to the PG speed when this setting is NOT set to 0. 
 Faults include: bb, oc, ov, occ. To restart after oc, ov, occ, you can NOT set Pr.07-11 to 0.  
  Number of Times of Restart after Fault  
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0–10 
 After fault (allowed fault: oc, ov, occ) occurs, the AC motor drive can reset and restart 
automatically up to 10 times. If Pr.07-11 is set to 0,  the drive resets or restarts automatically after 
faults occur. The drive starts according to the Pr.07-10 setting after restarting after fault. 
 If the number of faults exceeds the Pr.07-11 setting, the drive does not reset and restart until you 
press “RESET” manually and execute the operation command again. 
  Speed Tracking during Start-up 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Disable 
   1: Speed tracking by the maximum output frequency 
   2: Speed tracking by the motor frequency at start-up 
   3: Speed tracking by the minimum output frequency 
 Speed tracking is suitable for punch, fans and other large inertia loads. For example, a 
mechanical punch usually has a large inertia flywheel, and the general stop method is coast to 
stop. If it needs to be restarted again, the flywheel may take 2–5 minutes or longer to stop. This parameter setting allows you to start the flywheel operating again without waiting until the flywheel stops completely. 
 In PG control mode, the AC motor drive executes the speed tracking function automatically 
according to the PG speed when this setting is NOT set to 0. 
  dEb Function Selection 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Disable 
   1: dEb with auto-acceleration / auto-deceleration, the drive does not output 
the frequency after the power is restored. 
   2: dEb with auto-acceleration / auto-deceleration, the drive outputs the 
frequency after the power is restored. 
3: dEb low-voltage control, then the drive’s voltage increases to 350 V DC / 700 
VDC and ramps to stop after low frequency 
4: dEb high-voltage control of 350 V DC / 700 V DC, and the drive ramps to stop

 12.1-07-6  dEb (Deceleration Energy Backup) lets the motor decelerate to stop when momentary power loss 
occurs. When the power loss is instantaneous, use this function to let the motor decelerate to 
zero speed. If the power recovers at this time, the drive restarts the motor after the dEb return time.  
 Lv return level: Default value depends on the drive power model.  
Models for frame A, B, C, D = Pr.06-00 + 75 V (575V series) / 60 V (460V series) / 30 V (230V series) Models for frame E and above = Pr.06-00 + 80 V / 40 V (230V series) 
 Lv level: Default is Pr.06-00. 
 During dEb operation, other protection, such as ryF, ov, oc, occ, and EF may interrupt it, and 
these error codes are recorded. 
 The STOP (RESET) command does not work during the dEb auto-deceleration, and the drive 
continues decelerating to stop. To make the drive coast to stop immediately, use another function (EF) instead. 
 The B.B. function does not work  when executing dEb. The B.B. function is enabled after the dEb 
function finishes. 
 Even though the Lv warning does not display during dEb operation, if the DC bus voltage is lower 
than the Lv level, MO = 10 (Low voltage warning) still operates.  
 The following explains the dEb action:  
When the DC bus voltage drops below the dEb setting level, the dEb function starts to work (soft start relay remains closed), and the drive executes auto-deceleration.  
 
 Situation 1: Momentary power loss, or too low and unstable power voltage, or power supply sliding 
down because of sudden heavy load  
Pr.07-13 = 1 and power recovers 
When the power recovers and DC bus voltage exceeds the dEb return level, the drive linearly decelerates to 0 Hz and stops. The keypad displays the “dEb” warning until you manually reset it, so you can see the reason for the stop.

 12.1-07-7  Situation 2: Momentary power loss, or too low and unstable power voltage, or power supply sliding 
down because of sudden heavy load 
Pr.07-13 = 2 and power recovers 
During the dEb deceleration (includes 0 Hz run), if the power recovers to a voltage higher than dEb 
return level, the drive maintains the frequency for three seconds and then accelerates again. The “dEb” warning on the keypad is automatically cleared. 
  
 
 Situation 3:  Unexpected power shut down or power loss 
Pr.07-13 = 1 and power does not recover 
The keypad displays the “dEb” warning and the drive stops after decelerating to the lowest 
operating frequency. When the DC bus voltage is lower than the Lv level, the drive disconnects the soft start relay until the power completely runs out.

 12.1-07-8  Situation 4: Unexpected power shut down or power loss  
           Pr.07-13 = 2 and power does not recover 
The drive decelerates to 0 Hz. The DC bus voltage continues to decrease until the voltage is lower 
than the Lv level, and then the drive disconnects the soft start relay. The keypad displays “dEb” warning until the drive completely runs out of power.  
 Situation 5: Pr.07-13 = 2 and power recovers after the DC bus voltage is lower than the Lv level. 
The drive decelerates to 0 Hz. The DC bus voltage continues to decrease until the voltage is lower than the Lv level, and then the drive disconnects the soft start relay. The soft start relay closes again after the power recovers and the DC bus voltage is higher than the Lv return level. When the DC bus voltage is higher than the dEb return level, the drive maintains the frequency for three seconds and starts to accelerate linearly. The “dEb” warning on the keypad is automatically cleared.

 12.1-07-10   Automatic Energy-saving Setting 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Disable  
   1: Enable 
 When energy-saving is enabled, the motor acceleration/deceleration operates with full voltage. 
During constant speed operation, it automatically calculates the best voltage value according to 
the load power. This function is not suitable for fluctuating loads or loads which are nearly full during operation. 
 When the output frequency is constant (that is, constant operation), the output voltage decreases 
automatically as the load decreases. Therefore, the drive operates with minimum multiplication of voltage and current (electric power) to reach the energy-saving.
  Energy-saving Gain 
        Default: 100 
  Settings 10–1000% 
 When Pr.07-21 is set to 1, use this parameter to adjust the energy-saving gain. The default is 
100%. If the result is not satisfactory, adjust it by decreasing the setting value. If the motor oscillates, then increase the setting value. 
 In certain applications such as high speed spindles, the temperature rise in the motor is a major 
concern. When the motor is not in working state, reduce the motor current to a lower level. Reduce this parameter setting to meet this requirement. 
  Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) Function 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Enable AVR 
   1: Disable AVR 
   2: Disable AVR during deceleration 
 The rated voltage of a 220V motor is usually 200 V AC, 60 Hz / 50 Hz, and the input voltage of the 
AC motor drive may vary from 180–264 V AC, 50 Hz / 60 Hz. Therefore, when the AC motor drive 
is used without the AVR function, the output voltage is the same as the input voltage. When the motor runs at the voltage exceeding 12–20% of the rated voltage, it causes higher temperatures, damaged insulation, and unstable torque output, which result in losses due to shorter motor lifetime. 
 The AVR function automatically regulates the output voltage of the AC motor drive to the motor’s 
rated voltage when the input voltage exceeds the motor’s rated voltage. For example, if the V/F curve is set at 200 V
AC, 50 Hz and the input voltage is at 200–264 V AC, then the drive 
automatically reduces the output voltage to the motor to a maximum of 200 V AC, 50 Hz. If the 
input voltage is at 180–200 V AC, the output voltage to motor is in direct proportion to the input 
voltage. 
 0: When the AVR function is enabled, the drive calculates the output voltage according to the 
actual DC bus voltage. The output voltage does NOT change when the DC bus voltage changes.

 12.1-07-11  1: When the AVR function is disabled, the drive calculates the output voltage according to the 
actual DC bus voltage. The output voltage changes with the DC bus voltage, and may cause 
insufficient current, over-current or oscillation. 
 2: The drive disables the AVR function only during deceleration to stop, and at this time, you can 
accelerate the braking to achieve the same result. 
 When the motor ramps to stop, disable the AVR function to shorten the deceleration time. Then, 
use with the auto-acceleration and auto-deceleration functions to make the motor’s deceleration more stable and quicker. 
  Torque Command Filter Time (V/F and SVC Control Mode) 
        Default: 0.050 
  Settings 0.001–10.000 sec.  
 When the time constant setting is too large, the control is stable but the control response is slow. 
When the time constant setting is too small, the control response is faster but the control may be unstable. For optimal setting, adjust the setting based on the control stability or the control response. 
  Slip Compensation Filter Time (V/F and SVC Control Mode) 
        Default: 0.100 
  Settings 0.001–10.000 sec. 
 Change the compensation response time with Pr.07-24 and Pr.07-25. 
 If you set Pr.07-24 and Pr.07-25 to 10 seconds, the compensation response time is the slowest; 
however, the system may be unstable if you set the time too short. 
  Torque Compensation Gain (V /F and SVC Control Mode) 
.  Torque Compensation Gain (Motor 2) 
  Torque Compensation Gain (Motor 3) 
  Torque Compensation Gain (Motor 4) 
        Default: 1 
  Settings IM: 0–10 (when Pr.05-33=0) 
   PM: 0–5000 (when Pr.05-33=1 or 2) 
 With a large motor load, a part of the drive output voltage is absorbed by the stator winding 
resistor; therefore, the air gap magnetic field is insufficient. This causes insufficient voltage at motor induction and results in excessive output curr ent but insufficient output torque. Auto-torque 
compensation can automatically adjust the output voltage according to the load and keep the air gap magnetic fields stable to get the optimal operation. 
 In the V/F control, the voltage decreases in direct proportion with decreasing frequency. The 
torque decreases at low speed because of a decreasing AC resistor and an unchanged DC resistor. The auto-torque compensation function increases the output voltage at low frequency to get a higher starting torque. 
 When the compensation gain is set too high, it may cause motor over-flux and result in a too large 
output current of the drive, motor overheating or trigger the drive’s protection function.

 12.1-07-12   Slip Compensation Gain (V/F and SVC Control Mode) 
  Slip Compensation Gain (Motor 2) 
  Slip Compensation Gain (Motor 3) 
  Slip Compensation Gain (Motor 4) 
       Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–10.00                             (Default value is 1 in SVC mode) 
 The induction motor needs constant slip to produce electromagnetic torque. It can be ignored at 
higher motor speeds, such as rated speed or 2–3% of slip. 
 However, during the drive operation, the slip and the synchronous frequency are in reverse 
proportion to produce the same electromagnetic torque. The slip is larger with the reduction of the 
synchronous frequency. Moreover, the motor may stop when the synchronous frequency decreases to a specific value. Therefore, the sl ip seriously affects the motor speed accuracy at 
low speed. 
 In another situation, when you use an induction mo tor with the drive, the slip increases when the 
load increases. It also affects the motor speed accuracy. 
 Use this parameter to set the compensation frequency, and reduce the slip to maintain the 
synchronous speed when the motor runs at the rated current in order to improve the accuracy of 
the drive. When the drive output current is higher than Pr.05-05 (No-load Current for Induction Motor 1 (A)), the drive compensates the frequency according to this parameter.  
 This parameter is set to 1.00 automatically when Pr.00-11 (Speed Control Mode) is changed from 
V/F mode to vector mode. Otherwise, it is automatically set to 0.00. Apply the slip compensation after load and acceleration. Increase the compensation value from small to large gradually; add the output frequency to the [motor rated slip x Pr.07-27 (Slip Compensation Gain)] when the motor is at the rated load. If the actual speed ratio is slower than expected, increase the parameter setting value; otherwise, decrease the setting value. 

   1: Fault and ramp to stop 
   2: Fault and coast to stop 
   3: No warning 
 Pr.07-29–Pr.07-31 set the allowable slip level/time and the over-slip treatment when the drive is 
running.

 12.1-07-13   Motor Oscillation Compensation Factor 
        Default: 1000 
  Settings 0–10000 
 If there are current wave motions which cause severe motor oscillation in some specific area, 
setting this parameter can effectively improve th is situation. (When running with high frequency or 
PG, set this parameter to 0. When the current wave motion occurs in low frequency and high 
power, increase the value for Pr.07-32.) 
  Auto-restart Interval of Fault 
        Default: 60.0 
  Settings 0.0–6000.0 sec. 
 When a reset/restart occurs after a fault, the drive uses Pr.07-33 as a timer and starts counting 
the number of faults within this time period. Within this period, if the number of faults does not exceed the setting for Pr.07-11, the counting clears and starts from 0 when the next fault occurs. 

 OOB Average Sampling Angle 
        Default: Read only 
  Settings Read only 
 You can use the OOB (Out Of Balance Detection) function with the PLC program in the washing 
machine system. When the multi-function input terminal Pr.02-01–02-07 is set to 82 (OOB loading balance detection), the Pr.07-48 (OOB Average Sampling Angle) Δθ value is set 
according to Pr.07-46 (OOB Sampling Time) and Pr.07-47 (Number of OOB Sampling Times).  
 The PLC or host controller determines the motor speed according to the Pr.07-48 (OOB Average 
Sampling Angle) Δθ value. When the Average Sampling Angle Δθ  value is large, the load is 
unbalanced. In this case, the PLC or host controller must decrease the Frequency command. Otherwise, increase the Frequency command to execute high speed operations when Pr.07-48 Δθ value is small. 
 Related parameters:

 12.1-08-2 3. Concept of PID control: 
Proportional gain (P):  
The output is proportional to input. With only a proportional gain control, there is always a steady-state error. 
Integral time (I):  
The controller output is proportional to the integral of the controller input. When an automatic control system is in a steady state and a steady-state error occurs, the system is called a System with Steady-state Error. To eliminate the steady-state error, add an “integral part” to the controller. The integral time controls the relation between the integral part and the error. The integral part increases over time even if the error is small. It gradually increases the controller output to eliminate the error until it is zero. This stabilizes the system without a steady-state error by using proportional gain control and integral time control. 
Differential control (D): 
The controller output is proportional to the differential of the controller input. During elimination of the error, oscillation or instability may occur. Use the differential control to suppress these effects by acting before the error. That is, when the error is near 0, the differential control should be 0. Use proportional gain (P) and differential control (D) to improve the system state during PID adjustment. 
4. Using PID control in a constant pressure pump feedback application:  
Set the application’s constant pressure value (bar) to be the set point of PID control. The pressure sensor sends the actual value as the PID feedback value. After comparing the PID set point and PID feedback, an error displays. The PID controller calculates the output by using proportional gain (P), integral time (I) and differential time (D) to control the pump. It controls the 
drive to use a different pump speed and achieves constant pressure control by using a 4
–20 mA 
signal corresponding to 0 –10 bar as feedback to the drive.

  Proportional Gain (P) 
        Default: 1.00

0.00–100.00 (When Pr.08-23 bit 1 = 1) 
 1.0: Kp gain is 100%; if the setting is 0.5, Kp gain is 50%. 
 Sets the proportional gain to determine the deviation response speed. The higher the 
proportional gain, the faster the response speed. E liminates the system deviation; usually used 
to decrease the deviation and get faster response speed. If you set the value too high, overshoot occurs and it may cause system oscillation and instability. 
 If you set the other two gains (I and D) to zero, proportional control is the only effective parameter.

  Integral Time (I) 
        Default: 1.00 
  Settings 0.00–100.00 sec. 
 Use the integral controller to eliminate the deviation during stable system operation. The integral 
control does not stop working until the deviation is zero. The integral is affected by the integral time. The smaller the integral time, the stronger the integral action. It is helpful to reduce overshoot and oscillation for a st able system. Accordingly, the speed to lower the steady-state 
deviation decreases. The integral control is often used with the other two controls for the PI controller or PID controller. 
 Sets the integral time of the I controller. When the integral time is long, there is a small I 
controller gain, with slower response and slow external control. When the integral time is short, there is a large I controller gain, with faster response and rapid external control.  
 When the integral time is too short, it may cause overshoot or oscillation for the output frequency 
and system.  
 Set Integral Time to 0.00 to disable the I controller.

 12.1-08-4   Differential Time (D) 
        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–1.00 sec. 
 Use the differential controller to show the sy stem deviation change, as well as to preview the 
change in the deviation. You can use the differential controller to eliminate the deviation in order 
to improve the system state. Using a suitable differential time can reduce overshoot and shorten 
adjustment time; however, the differential operation increases noise interference. Note that a too large differential causes more noise interference. In addition, the differential shows the change and the differential output is 0 when there is no change. Note that you cannot use the differential control independently. You must use it with the other two controllers for the PD controller or PID controller. 
 Sets the D controller gain to determine the deviation change response. Using a suitable 
differential time reduces the P and I controllers overshoot to decrease the oscillation for a stable system. A differential time that is too long may cause system oscillation. 
 The differential controller acts on the change in the deviation and cannot reduce the interference. 
Do not use this function when there is significant interference.

        Default: 100.0

 Defines an upper bound for the integral gain (I) and therefore limits the master frequency.  
The formula is: Integral upper bound = Maximum Operation Frequency (Pr.01-00) x (Pr.08-04%).  
 An excessive integral value causes a slow response due to sudden load changes and may 
cause motor stall or machine damage. If so, decrease it to a proper value. 

communications (Pr.08-00 = 7 or 8). 

        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Serial connection 
   1: Parallel connection 
 0: Use conventional PID control structure. 
1: The proportional gain, integral gain and differential gain are independent. You can customize 
the P, I and D value to fit your application. 
 Pr.08-07 determines the primary low pass filter time when in PID control. Setting a large time 
constant may slow down the drive’s response speed.  
 PID control output frequency is filtered with a primary low pass function. This function can filter a 
mix of frequencies. A long primary low pass time means the filter degree is high and a short 
primary low pass time means the filter degree is low.  
 Inappropriate delay time setting may cause system oscillation.  
 PI Control:  
Controlled only by the P action, so the deviation cannot be entirely eliminated. In general, to eliminate residual deviations, use the P + I controls. When you use the PI control, it eliminates the deviation caused by the targeted value changes and the constant external interferences. However, if the I action is too powerful, it delays the response when there is rapid variation. You can use the P action by itself to control the loading system with the integral components. 
 PD Control:  
When deviation occurs, the system immediately gener ates an operation load that is greater than 
the load generated only by the D action to restrain the deviation increment. If the deviation is small, the effectiveness of the P action dec reases as well. The control objects include 
applications with integral component loads, which are controlled by the P action only. Sometimes, if the integral component is functioning, the whole system may oscillate. In this case, use the PD 
control to reduce the P action’s oscillation and stabilize the system. In other words, this control is useful with no brake function’s loading over the processes. 
 PID Control:  
Use the I action to eliminate the deviation and the D action to reduce oscillation; then combine this with the P action for the PID control. Use the PID method for a control process with no deviations, high accuracy, and a stable system.

 12.1-08-8   PID Feedback Signal Filter Time 
        Default: 5.0 
  Settings 0.1–300.0 sec. 
 When the PID control function is normal, it should calculate the value within a period of time that 
is close to the target value. 
Refer to the PID control diagram for details. When executing PID feedback control, if |PID reference target value - detection value| > Pr.08-13 PID Feedback Signal Error Deviation Level and time exceeds Pr.08-14 setting, it is regarded as a PID control fault, and the multi-function output terminal setting 15 (PID feedback error) activates.

  PID Compensation Selection 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Parameter setting 
   1: Analog input 
 0: The setting for Pr.08-17 gives the PID compensation value. 
  PID Compensation 
        Default: 0 
  Settings -100.0–100.0% 
 The PID compensation value = maximum PID target value × Pr.08-17. For example, if the 
maximum operation frequency Pr.01-00 = 60 Hz, and Pr.08-17 = 10.0%, the PID compensation value increases the output frequency 6.00 Hz (60.00 Hz × 100.00% × 10.0% = 6.00 Hz).
 
  Sleep Mode Function Setting 
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: Refer to PID output command 
   1: Refer to PID feedback signal 
 0: The unit for Pr.08-10 and that for Pr.08-11 switch to frequency. The settings are between 
0.00–599.00 Hz. 
 1: The unit for Pr.08-10 and that for Pr.08-11 switch to percentage. The settings are between 
0.00–200.00%. 

        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–600.00 sec. 
 Refer to Pr.08-18 for more information. 
 PID Control Flag 
        Default: 2 
  Settings bit 0 = 1, PID running in reverse follows the setting for Pr.00-23. 
   bit 0 = 0, PID running in reverse refers to PID’s calculated value. 
   bit 1 = 1, two decimal places for PID Kp 
   bit 1 = 0, one decimal place for PID Kp 
 bit 0 = 1: PID running in reverse function is valid only when Pr.08-21=1. 
 bit 0 = 0: If the PID calculated value is positive, the direction is forward. If the PID calculated 
value is negative, the direction is reverse.  
 When the bit1 setting changes, the Kp gain does not change. For example: Kp = 6. When 
Pr.08-23 bit1 = 0, Kp = 6.0; when Pr.08-23 bit1 = 1, Kp = 6.00. 
 There are three scenarios for the sleep and wake-up frequency. 
1) Frequency Command (PID is not in use, Pr.08-00 = 0. Works only in VF mode) 
When the output frequency ≤ the sleep frequency and the drive reaches the preset sleep 
time, then the drive is in sleep mode (0 Hz). When the Frequency command reaches the 
wake-up frequency, the drive starts to count the wake-up delay time. When the drive reaches the wake-up delay time, it starts to catch up to reach the Frequency command value by the acceleration time. 
 
2) Internal PID Calculation Frequency Command (PID is in use, Pr.08-00 ≠ 0 and Pr.08-18=0.) 
When the PID calculation Frequency command reaches the sleep frequency, the drive starts 
to count the sleep time and the output frequency starts to decrease. If the drive exceeds the preset sleep time, then the drive is in sleep mode (0 Hz). If the drive does not reach the preset sleep time, it remains at the lower frequency limit (if there is a preset lower limit.), or it remains at the minimum output frequency set for Pr.01-07 and waits until it reaches the sleep time before going into sleep mode (0 Hz).  When the PID calculated Frequency command reaches the wake-up frequency, the drive starts to count the wake-up delay time. Once it reaches the wake-up delay time, the drive starts to catch up to reach the PID Frequency command value by the acceleration time.

 12.1-08-10   
3) PID Feedback Value Percentage (PID is in use, Pr.08-00 ≠ 0 and Pr.08-18 = 1) 
When the PID feedback value reaches the sleep level percentage, the drive starts to count 
the sleep time and the output frequency starts to decrease. If the drive exceeds the preset sleep 
time, then the drive is in sleep mode (0 Hz). If the drive does not reach preset the sleep time, it remains at the lower frequency limit (if there is a preset of lower limit.), or it remains at the minimum output frequency set for Pr.01-07 and waits until it reaches the sleep time before going into sleep mode (0 Hz). 
When the PID feedback value reaches the wake-up percentage, the drive starts to count the 
wake-up delay time. Once it reaches the wake-up delay time, the drive starts to catch up to reach the PID Frequency command value by the acceleration time.

 12.1-08-11   PID Output Command Limit (Reverse Limit) 
        Default: 100.0 
  Settings 0.0–100.0% 
 When PID enables the reverse direction, the PID output is a negative value, and the PID output 
value is limited by the setting for Pr.08-26. Use this function with Pr.08-21. 
  Acceleration / Deceleration Time for PID Command  
        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–655.35 sec. 
 0.00 seconds: Disables the PID acceleration/deceleration command, and the target value is 
equal to the PID command. 
 When this parameter is not set to 0.00 seconds: Enables the PID acceleration/deceleration 
command. For PID acceleration and deceleration, when the PID target value changes, the 
command value increment/decrement is executed according to this parameter. For example, if we set this parameter to 10.00 seconds, when PID target value changes from 0% to 100%, it takes 10 seconds for the PID command to change from 0% to 100%. In a similar way, when PID target value changes from 100% to 0%, it takes 10 seconds for the PID command to change from 100% to 0%.
 
  Frequency Base Corresponding to 100.00% PID  
        Default: 0 
  Settings 0: PID control output 100.00% corresponding to maximum operation 
frequency (Pr.01-00) 
   1: PID control output 100.00% corresponding to the input value of the 
auxiliary frequency 
 Valid only when you enable the master and auxiliary frequency functions.  
When Pr.08-29 = 0, PID control outputs 100.00% corresponding to the maximum operation frequency. When Pr.08-29 = 1, PID control outputs 100.00% corresponding to the auxiliary frequency. (The PID output frequency changes when the auxiliary frequency command changes.)

 Selects the target value source for the PID controller. 
 When Pr.08-65=0, the maximum operating frequency Pr.01-00 is 60 Hz, the error is 100%, and 
Pr.08-01=1.00, then the output frequency is ' ‟1” times the Pr.01-00 maximum operating 
frequency. Therefore, the output frequency = 60 * 100% * 1=60 Hz. Calculation formula:  Output frequency=Fmax (Pr.01-00) * error% ((PID reference value (Pr.00-20 / Pr.00-30) – PID feedback (Pr.08-00)) * Pr.08-01. 
 When Pr.08-65 ≠0, the internal calculation of the proportional gain reduces by 100 times, that is, 
when Pr.01-00 Fmax=60 Hz, error=100%, Pr.08-01=1.00, then the output frequency is ‟0.01” 
times the Pr.01-00 Fmax. Therefore, the output frequency=60 * 100% * 0.01=0.6 Hz. Calculation formula:  Output frequency=Fmax (Pr.01-00) * error% (( PID reference value (Pr.08-66) – PID feedback 
value (Pr.08-00)) * Pr.08-01 * 0.01.

 In some cases, it is only possible for the PID to control the set point and the feedback to the 
same status when the PID output frequency is negative (the motor runs in reverse). However, 
an excessively high reverse frequency is not allowed in some cases, and Pr.08-67 is used to determine the upper limit of the reverse frequency 
  PID Deviation Limit 
        Default: 0.00 
  Settings 0.00–100.00% 
 When Pr.08-68 is not set to 0, the PID deviation limit function is enabled. 
 When PID deviation ≤ PID deviation limit, PID stops adjusting, which means the PID output 
frequency maintains the value at last status. This function is effective for some closed-loop control applications.

 Reduces overshoot when overshoot occurs in the PID feedback at start-up. 
 When Pr.08-69 is not set to 0, the integral separation function is enabled. 
 The benchmark for the integral separation level is the PID error%. 
 The integral separation function activates only once at start-up.

 Use the smart start-up function to reduce overshoot when overshoot occurs in the PID 
feedback at start-up. The smart start-up activates only once at start-up. 
 When the smart start-up function is enabled, it starts with the Pr.08-71 frequency and Pr.08-72 
acceleration time (Pr.08-72 acceleration time is the time that it accelerates to Pr.08-71). When 
the PID deviation is smaller than Pr.08-70, it switches to the normal PID control (the smart start-up frequency is filled into the PID integral when switching to PID control to avoid discontinuous frequency).

3.4 Checksum 
(1) ASCII mode (LRC Check):  
LRC (Longitudinal Redundancy Check) is calculated by summing up the values of the bytes from 
ADR1 to the last data character then calculating the hexadecimal representation of the 
2’s-complement negation of the sum. 
For example, as shown in the above Section 3.3.(1), 
01H + 03H + 21H + 02H + 00H + 02H = 29H, the 2’s-complement negation of 29H is D7H. 
(2) RTU mode (CRC Check): 
CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check) is calculated by the following steps: Step 1: Load a 16-bit register (called CRC register) with FFFFH. 
Step 2:  Exclusive OR the first 8-bit byte of the command message with the low order byte of the 
16-bit CRC register, and put the result in the CRC register. 
Step 3:  Examine the LSB of CRC register.  
Step 4: If the LSB of CRC register is 0, shift the CRC register one bit to the right, fill MSB with 
zero, then repeat step 3. If the LSB of CRC register is 1, shift the CRC register one bit to 
the right, fill MSB with zero, Exclusive OR  the CRC register with the polynomial value 
A001H, then repeat step 3. 
Step 5:  Repeat step 3 and 4 until you perform eight shifts. This processes a complete 8-bit byte. 
Step 6:  Repeat step 2 through 5 for the next 8-bit byte of the command message. Continue doing 
this until all bytes are processed. The final contents of the CRC register are the CRC value. When transmitting the CRC value in the message, the upper and lower bytes of the CRC value must be swapped, that is, the lower order byte is transmitted first. 
The following is an example of CRC generation using C language.  The function takes two arguments: 
Unsigned char* data  a pointer to the message buffer 
Unsigned char length  the quantity of bytes in the message buffer 
The function returns the CRC value as a type of unsigned integer.

5. Exception response:  
When the drive is using the communication connection, if an error occurs, the drive responds 
to the error code and sets the highest bit (bit 7) of the command code to 1 (function code AND 
80H) then responds to the control system to signal that an error occurred. 
If the keypad displays “CE-XX” as a warning message, “XX” is the error code at that time. 
Refer to the table of error codes for communication error for reference. 
Example: 
ASCII mode:  RTU mode: 
STX ‘:’  Address 01H 
Address ‘0’  Function 86H

 12.1-09-12   Communication Response Delay Time 
        Default: 2.0 
  Settings 0.0–200.0 ms 
 If the host controller does not finish the transmitting/receiving process, you can use this 
parameter to set the response delay time after the AC motor drive receives communication 
command as shown in the following picture. 
 
  Communication Main Frequency  
        Default: 60.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 Hz 
 When you set Pr.00-20 to 1 (RS-485 communication input), the AC motor drive saves the last 
Frequency command into Pr.09-10 when there is abnormal power off or momentary power loss. When power is restored, the AC motor drive operates with the frequency in Pr.09-10 if there is no new Frequency command input. When a Frequency command of 485 changes (the Frequency command source must be set as Modbus), this parameter also changes.

 12.1-10-1 10 Speed Feedback Control Parameters  
 You can set this parameter during operation. 
In this parameter group, ASR is the abbreviation for Adjust Spe ed Regulator and PG is the 
abbreviation for Pulse Generator.  
  Encoder Type Selection 
               D e f a u l t: 0 
  Settings 0: Disabled 
   5: Pulse input (MI7) 
 When you use MI7 single-phase pulse input, you must use it wit h Pr.00-20=4, Pr.10-00=0 and 
Pr.10-16=5.  
 When you use MI7 single-phase puluse input as speed feedback, you must use it with 
Pr.10-00=5 and Pr.10-02=5. The drive calculates the MI7 single- phase pulse input speed when 
the control modes are VF, VFPG, SVC IM/PM FOC sensorless, and IM/PM TQC 
 The MS300 does not support the full position control pulse command input function. 
  Encoder Pulses per Revolution 
               D e f a u l t: 600 
  Settings 1–20000 
 This parameter sets the encoder pulses per revolution (PPR). I t is a feedback control signal 
source when using PG. The encoder sets the number of pulses for  the motor rotating through one 
rotation. The A/B phase cycle generates the pulse number. 
 This setting is also the encoder resolution. The speed control  is more accurate with higher 
resolution. 
 If you set this parameter incorrectly, it may cause motor stal l, drive over-current, or a permanent 
magnetic pole origin detection error for the PM motor in closed -loop control. When using the PM 
motor, you must perform the magnetic pole origin detection (Pr. 05-00 = 13) again if you modify 
the content of this parameter. 
  Encoder Input Type Setting

  Encoder Stall Level 
               D e f a u l t: 115 
  Settings 0–120% (0: Disable) 
 Determines the maximum encoder feedback signal allowed before a fault occurs; the maximum 
operation frequency Pr.01-00 = 100%. 
  Detection Time of Encoder Stall  
               D e f a u l t: 0.1 
  Settings 0.0–2.0 sec.

               D e f a u l t: 2 
  Settings 0: Warn and continue operation 
   1: Fault and ramp to stop 
   2: Fault and coast to stop  
 When the drive output frequency exceeds the encoder stall leve l (Pr.10-10), the drive starts to 
count the time. When the error time exceeds the encoder stall d etection time (Pr.10-11), the drive 
implements the encoder stall action. 
  Encoder Slip Range 
               D e f a u l t: 50 
  Settings 0–50% (0: Disable) 
  Detection Time of Encoder Slip

  Settings 0.0–10.0 sec. 
  Encoder Stall and Slip Error Action 
               D e f a u l t: 2 
  Settings 0: Warn and continue operation 
   1: Fault and ramp to stop 
   2: Fault and coast to stop  
 This parameter acts on the settings for Pr.10-13–Pr.10-15: 
When the value of (rotation speed – motor frequency) exceeds th e Pr.10-13 setting, and the 
detection time exceeds Pr.10-14; the drive starts to count the time. If the detection time exceeds 
Pr.10-14, the encoder feedback signal error occurs.

               D e f a u l t: 0 
  Settings 0: Disabled 
   5: Single-phase input (MI7) 
 When Pr.10-16=5, you cannot set Pr.10-02 to 5: Single-phase in put (MI7) for closed-loop control. 
 The setting steps when using the MI7 single-phase pulse input as the frequency command: 
1. Set Pr.00-20=4: Pulse input without direction command 
2. Set Pr.10-00=5: Pulse input (MI7) 3. Set Pr.10-01 to motor pulses per revolution (PPR) 4. Set Pr.10-16=5: Single-phase input (MI7) 5. Set Pr.00-04=22 (Pulse input frequency) to verify if the pul se input frequency is correct. 
  Electrical Gear A 
  Electrical Gear B 
               D e f a u l t: 100 
  Settings 1–65535 
 Rotation speed = pulse frequency / encoder pulses (Pr.10-01) *  electrical gear A / electrical gear

 12.1-10-4   FOC Bandwidth for Speed Observer 
        Default: 40.0 
  Settings 20.0–100.0 Hz 
 Setting the speed observer to a higher bandwidth could shorten  the speed response time but 
creates greater noise interference during the speed observation .   
  FOC Minimum Stator Frequency  
        Default: 2.0 
  Settings 0.0–10.0% fN 
 Sets the stator frequency lower limit in operation status. Thi s setting ensures the stability and 
accuracy of observer and avoids interferences from voltage, cur rent and motor parameters. fN is 
the motor rated frequency.  
  FOC Low Pass Filter Time Constant 
        Default: 50 
  Settings 1–1000 ms 
 Sets the low pass filter time constant of a flux observer at start-up. If you cannot activate the 
motor during high speed operation, lower the setting for this p arameter.  
  FOC Gain for Excitation Current Rise Time 
        Default: 100 
  Settings 33–100% Tr 
 Sets the drive’s excitation current rise time when it activates in open-loop torque mode. When the 
drive’s activation time is too long in torque mode, adjust this parameter to a shorter time value. Tr 
is the rotor time constant. 
  Upper Limit of Frequency Deviation 
               D e f a u l t: 20.00 
  Settings 0.00–200.00 Hz 
 Limits the maximum frequency deviation.  
 If you set this parameter too high, an abnormal feedback malfu nction occurs. 
 If the application needs a higher setting for Pr.10-29, note t hat a higher setting results in larger 
motor slip, which causes a PG Error (PGF3, PGF4). In this case,  you can set Pr.10-10 and 
Pr.10-13 to 0 to disable PGF3 and PGF4 detection, but you must make sure the MI7 wiring and 
application are correct; otherwise, it may lose the instant PG protection. Setting Pr.10-29 too high 
is not commonly done. 
  I/F Mode, Current Command  
               D e f a u l t: 40 
  Settings 0–150% rated current of the motor 
 Sets the current command for the drive in the low speed area (low speed area: Frequency 
command < Pr.10-39). When the motor stalls on heavy duty start-up or forward/reverse with load, increase the parameter value. If the inrush current is too high and causes oc stall, then decrease the parameter value.

 12.1-10-5   PM FOC Sensorless Speed Estimator Bandwidth 
               D e f a u l t: 5.00 
  Settings 0.00–600.00 Hz 
 Sets the speed estimator bandwidth. Adjust the parameter to in fluence the stability and the 
accuracy of the motor speed. 
 If there is low frequency vibration (the waveform is similar t o a sine wave) during the process, 
then increase the bandwidth. If there is high frequency vibrati on (the waveform shows extreme 
vibration and is like a spur), then decrease the bandwidth. 
  PM Sensorless Speed Estimator Low-pass Filter Gain 
               D e f a u l t: 1.00 
  Settings 0.00–655.35 
 Influences the response speed of the speed estimator. 
 If there is low frequency vibration (the waveform is similar t o a sine wave) during the process, 
then increase the gain. If there is high frequency vibration (t he waveform shows extreme 
vibration and is like a spur), then decrease the gain. 
  AMR (Kp) Gain 
        Default: 1.00 
  Settings 0.00–3.00 
 AMR (Ki) Gain 
        Default: 0.20 
  Settings 0.00–3.00 
  Frequency Point to Switch from I/F  Mode to PM Sensorless Mode 
               D e f a u l t: 20.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 Hz 
 Sets the frequency for the switch point from low frequency to high frequency. 
 Due to the weak back-EMF in the low frequency area, PM sensorl ess mode cannot estimate the 
accurate speed and position of the rotor. Thus, using I/F mode control is more suitable. In the 
medium-to-high frequency area, PM sensorless can accurately est imate the back-EMF, 
stabilizes and controls the motor with lower current. 
 If the switch point is too low and PM sensorless mode operates at a too low frequency, the motor 
does not generate enough back-EMF to let the speed estimator me asure the right position and 
speed of the rotor, and causes stall and oc when running at the switch point frequency. 
 If the switch point is too high, the drive easily runs in the frequency area of the I/F mode for a long 
time, which generates a larger current and cannot save energy. (If the current for Pr.10-31 is too 
high, the high switch point makes the drive continue to output with the setting value for Pr.10-31.)

               D e f a u l t: 20.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 Hz 
 Sets the switch point from high frequency to low frequency. 
 Due to the weak back-EMF in the low frequency area, PM sensorl ess mode cannot estimate the

does not generate enough back-EMF to let the speed estimator me asure the right position and 
speed of the rotor, and causes stall and oc when running at the switch point frequency. 
 If the switch point is too high, the drive easily runs in the frequency area of the I/F mode for a long 
time, which generates more current and cannot save energy. (If the current for Pr.10-31 is too 
high, the high switch point makes the drive continue to output with the setting value for Pr.10-31.) 
  Initial Angle Detection Pulse Value 
               D e f a u l t: 1.0 
  Settings 0.0–3.0 
 The angle detection is fixed to 3: Use the pulse injection met hod to start. The parameter 
influences the value of the pulse during the angle detection. The larger the pulse, the higher the accuracy of rotor’s position. A larger pulse might cause oc. 
 Increase the parameter when the running direction and the comm and are opposite during 
start-up. If oc occurs at start-up, then decrease the parameter . 
 Refer to Section 12-2 Adjustment & Application for detailed mo tor adjustment procedure. 
  Zero Voltage Time during Start-up 
         Default: 0.000  
  Settings 0.000–60.000 sec. 
 This parameter is valid only when the setting of Pr.07-12 (Speed Tracking during Start-up) = 0. 
 When the motor is in static state at start-up, this increases the accuracy when estimating angles. 
In order to put the motor in static state, set the three-phase of the drive output to the motor to 0 V. 
The Pr.10-49 setting time is the length of time for three-phase output at 0 V.  
 It is possible that even when you apply this parameter, the mo tor cannot go in to the static state 
because of inertia or some external force. If the motor does no t go into a complete static state in 
0.2 seconds, increase this setting value appropriately. 
 If Pr.10-49 is set too high, the start-up time is longer. If it is too low, then the braking performance 
is weak.

 12.1-10-7   Injection Frequency  
         Default: 500 
  Settings 0–1200 Hz 
 This parameter is a high frequency injection command in PM SVC control mode, and usually you 
do not need to adjust it. But if a motor’s rated frequency (for  example, 400 Hz) is too close to the 
frequency setting for this parameter (that is, the default of 500 Hz), it affects the accuracy of the 
angle detection. Refer to the setting for Pr.01-01 before you adjust this parameter. 
 If the setting value for Pr.00-17 is lower than Pr.10-51*10, t hen increase the frequency of the 
carrier frequency. 
 Pr.10-51 is valid only when Pr.10-53 = 2.

  Settings 115V / 230V series: 100.0 V 
   460V series: 200.0 V 
   575V series: 200.0 V 
   Note: The setting range varies depending on the voltage. 
 The parameter is the magnitude command for the high frequency injection signal in PM SVC 
control mode. 
 Increasing the parameter can increase the accuracy of the angle estimation, but the 
electromagnetic noise might be louder if the setting value is t oo high. 
 The system uses this parameter when the motor’s parameter is “ Auto”. This parameter 
influences the angle estimation accuracy. 
 When the ratio of the salient pole (Lq / Ld) is lower, increase Pr.10-52 to make the angle 
detection accurate. 
 Pr.10-52 is valid only when Pr.10-53 = 2.

  Settings 0: Disabled 
1: Force attracting the rotor to zero degrees  
2: High frequency injection 3: Pulse injection 
 Set to 2 for IPM; set to 3 for SPM. If these settings cause pr oblems, then set the parameter to 1.

In this parameter group, ASR stands for Adjust Speed Regulator.  
  System Control 
        Default: 0 
  Settings bit 0: Auto-tuning for ASR and APR 
   bit 3: Dead time compensation closed 
   bit 7: Save or do not save the frequency 
 bit 0 = 0: Pr.11-06–Pr.11-11 are valid and Pr.11-03–Pr.11-05 a re invalid. 
bit 7 = 0: Save the frequency before power is OFF. When power is ON again, the saved 
frequency is displayed. 
bit 7 = 1: Do not save the frequency before power is OFF. When power is ON again, 0.00 Hz is 
the displayed frequency.  
  Per-Unit of System Inertia 
        Default: 256 
  Settings 1–65535 (256 = 1 PU) 
 To get the system inertia per unit from Pr.11-01, you need to set Pr.11-00 to bit1 = 1 and execute 
continuous forward / reverse running. 
 When Pr.11-01 = 256, it is 1PU. So if you use a 2HP motor, the 2HP motor inertia is 0.00043 
kg-cm2 according to the table below. If Pr.11-01 = 10000 after tuning, the system inertia is (10000 
/ 256) x 0.00043 kg-cm2. 
 Perform the operation test with load based on the inertia afte r tuning. Run the motor in 
acceleration, deceleration, and steady speed and observe the va lues. If values between speed 
feedback and speed command are close, steady-state error is small and overshoot is less, then 
this inertia is a better one. 
 If the Iq current command from ASR has high-frequency glitch, then decrease the setting. If the 
response time of sudden loading is too slow, then increase the setting. 
 When using torque mode as the control mode, perform the tuning with speed mode first to see if 
the tuned inertia can work normally. After verifying with speed  mode, change the control mode to 
torque mode.

meet two needs: in the high-speed region of the estimator switc h point it has a high response, 
and in the low-speed region of the estimator switch point it ha s a lower response. The 
recommended switching point is higher than Pr.10-39. 
 A low setting does not cover Pr.10-39. If the setting is too high, high-speed range is too narrow.

  Settings 0–200% 
 This parameter is invalid when Pr.05-24 = 1. 
 This parameter is valid only when Pr.11-00 bit0 = 1. 
 After you estimate and set Pr.11-00 bit0=1 (auto-tuning), use Pr.11-13 to reduce overshoot. 
However, a shift of the curve may occur earlier. In this case, you can set Pr.11-13=0 first, and 
then increase the setting value to "a condition with best accel eration and without overshoot" 
when the acceleration time meets your application but overshoot occurs. 
 Increasing Pr.11-13 improves the overshoot of speed tracking, but an excessive value may 
reduce the transient response. 
 Increasing Pr.11-13 enhances the system stiffness in high-speed steady state and reduces the 
speed transient fluctuation at a sudden loading. 
 Ensure that you set the Pr.11-01 system inertia correctly to get excellent improvement of the 
speed response.

   2: Disable  
 Prevents self-cooled motor from overheating under low speed. U se an electronic thermal relay to 
limit the drive’s output power. 
 Setting the parameter to 0 is suitable for an inverter motor ( motor fan using an independent 
power supply). For this kind of motor, there is no significant  correlation between cooling capacity 
and motor speed. Therefore, the action of electronic thermal relays remains stable in low speed 
to ensure the load capability of the motor in low speed. 
 Setting the parameter to 1 is suitable for standard motor (motor fan is fixed on the rotor shaft). 
For this kind of motor, the cooling capacity is lower in low speed; therefore, the action of an electronic thermal relay reduces the action time to ensure the life of motor. 
 When the power is cycled frequently, if the power is switched OFF, the electronic thermal relay 
protection is reset; therefore, even setting the parameter to 0  or 1 may not protect the motor well. 
If there are several motors connected to one drive, install an electronic thermal relay in each 
motor.

characteristic curve of electronic thermal relay, the output fr equency and current of the drive, and 
the operation time to prevent the motor from overheating. 
 
 The action of the electronic thermal relay depends on the sett ings for Pr.14-80 and Pr.14-82 
1. Pr.14-80 or Pr.14-82 is set to 0 (using inverter motor): 
When the output current of the drive is higher than 150% of the motor rated current (refer to 
the motor rated current % corresponded to the motor rated frequency in the motor cooling curve with independent fan), the drive starts to count the time . The electronic thermal relay 
acts when the accumulated time exceeds Pr.14-81 or Pr.14-83. 
2. Pr.14-80 or Pr.14-82 is set to 1 (using standard motor): 
When the output current of the drive is higher than 150% of the motor rated current (refer to the motor rated current % corresponded to the motor rated frequency in the motor cooling curve with shaft-fixed fan), the drive starts to count the time . The electronic thermal relay acts 
when the accumulated time exceeds Pr.14-81 or Pr.14-83. The actual electronic thermal relay action time adjusts accordi ng to the drive output current 
(shown as the motor loading rate %). The action time is short w hen the current is high, and 
the action time is long when the current is low. Refer to the f ollowing diagram.

 12.2-5 12. Set up the related para meters for speed estimators 
  I/F Mode, Current Command  
               D e f a u l t: 40 
  Settings 0–150% rated current of the motor 
 Sets the current command for the drive in the low speed area (low speed area: Frequency 
command < Pr.10-39). When the motor stalls on heavy duty start-up or forward/reverse with load, 
increase the parameter value. If the inrush current is too high and causes oc stall, then decrease the parameter value. 
  PM FOC Sensorless Speed Estimator Bandwidth 
               D e f a u l t: 5.00 
  Settings 0.00–600.00 Hz 
 Sets the speed estimator bandwidth. Adjust the parameter to influence the stability and the 
accuracy of the motor speed. 
 If there is low frequency vibration (the waveform is similar t o a sine wave) during the process, 
then increase the bandwidth. If there is high frequency vibrati on (the waveform shows extreme 
vibration and is like a spur), then decrease the bandwidth. 
  PM Sensorless Speed Estimator Low-pass Filter Gain 
               D e f a u l t: 1.00 
  Settings 0.00–655.35 
 Influences the response speed of the speed estimator. 
 If there is low frequency vibration (the waveform is similar t o a sine wave) during the process, 
then increase the gain. If there is high frequency vibration (t he waveform shows extreme 
vibration and is like a spur), then decrease the gain. 
  Frequency Point to Switch from I/F Mode to PM Sensorless Mode 
               D e f a u l t: 20.00 
  Settings 0.00–599.00 Hz 
 Sets the frequency for the switch point from low frequency to high frequency. 
 Due to the weak back-EMF in the low frequency area, PM sensorl ess mode cannot estimate the 
accurate speed and position of the rotor. Thus, using I/F mode control is more suitable. In the medium-to-high frequency area, PM sensorless can accurately est imate the back-EMF, stabilizes 
and controls the motor with lower current. 
 If the switch point is too low and PM sensorless mode operates  at a too low frequency, the motor 
does not generate enough back-EMF to let the speed estimator me asure the right position and 
speed of the rotor, and causes stall and oc when running at the switch point frequency. 
 If the switch point is too high, the drive easily runs in the frequency area of the I/F mode for a long 
time, which generates a larger current and cannot save energy. (If the current for Pr.10-31 is too 
high, the high switch point makes the drive continue to output with the setting value for Pr.10-31.)

 12.2-6   Initial Angle Detection Pulse Value 
               D e f a u l t: 1.0 
  Settings 0.0–3.0 
 The angle detection is fixed to 3: Use the pulse injection met hod to start. The parameter 
influences the value of the pulse during the angle detection. The larger the pulse, the higher the 
accuracy of rotor’s position. A larger pulse might cause oc. 
 Increase the parameter when the running direction and the comm and are opposite during 
start-up. If oc occurs at start-up, then decrease the parameter . 
 Refer to Section 12-2 Adjustment & Application for detailed mo tor adjustment procedure. 
  Zero Voltage Time during Start-up 
         Default: 0.000  
  Settings 0.000–60.000 sec. 
 This parameter is valid only when the setting of Pr.07-12 (Speed Tracking during Start-up) = 0. 
 When the motor is in static state at start-up, this increases the accuracy when estimating angles. 
In order to put the motor in static state, set the three-phase of the drive output to the motor to 0 V. 
The Pr.10-49 setting time is the length of time for three-phase output at 0 V.  
 It is possible that even when you apply this parameter, the mo tor cannot go in to the static state 
because of inertia or some external force. If the motor does no t go into a complete static state in 
0.2 seconds, increase this setting value appropriately. 
 If Pr.10-49 is set too high, the start-up time is longer. If it is too low, then the braking performance 
is weak. 
  Injection Frequency  
         Default: 500 
  Settings 0–1200 Hz 
 This parameter is a high frequency injection command in PM SVC control mode, and usually you 
do not need to adjust it. But if a motor’s rated frequency (for  example, 400 Hz) is too close to the 
frequency setting for this parameter (that is, the default of 500 Hz), it affects the accuracy of the angle detection. Refer to the setting for Pr.01-01 before you adjust this parameter. 
 If the setting value for Pr.00-17 is lower than Pr.10-51*10, t hen increase the frequency of the 
carrier frequency. 
 Pr.10-51 is valid only when Pr.10-53 = 2.

  Settings 115V / 230V series: 100.0 V 
   460V series: 200.0 V 
   575V series: 200.0 V 
   Note: The setting range varies depending on the voltage. 
 The parameter is the magnitude command for the high frequency injection signal in PM SVC 
control mode. 
 
 Increasing the parameter can increase the accuracy of the angle estimation, but the 
electromagnetic noise might be louder if the setting value is t oo high. 
 The system uses this parameter when the motor’s parameter is “ Auto”. This parameter 
influences the angle estimation accuracy. 
 When the ratio of the salient pole (Lq / Ld) is lower, increase Pr.10-52 to make the angle 
detection accurate. 
 Pr.10-52 is valid only when Pr.10-53 = 2. 
 
 Angle Detection Method  
               D e f a u l t: 0 
  Settings 0: Disabled 
1: Force attracting the rotor to zero degrees  
2: High frequency injection 
3: Pulse injection 
 Set to 2 for IPM; set to 3 for SPM. If these settings cause pr oblems, then set the parameter to 1. 
 
13. Speed adjustment parameter 
  Torque Compensation Gain  
        Default: 1 
  Settings IM: 0–10 (when Pr.05-33=0) 
   PM Synchronous AC Motor: 0–5000 (when Pr.05-33=1 or 2) 
 With a large motor load, a part of the drive output voltage is  absorbed by the stator winding 
resistor; therefore, the air gap magnetic field is insufficient . This causes insufficient voltage at 
motor induction and results in excessive output current but insufficient output torque. Auto-torque 
compensation can automatically adjust the output voltage accord ing to the load and keep the air 
gap magnetic fields stable to get the optimal operation. 
 In the V/F control, the voltage decreases in direct proportion  with decreasing frequency. The 
torque decreases at low speed because of a decreasing AC resist or and an unchanged DC 
resistor. The auto-torque compensation function increases the o utput voltage at low frequency to 
get a higher starting torque. 
 When the compensation gain is set too high, it may cause motor  over-flux and result in a too large 
output current of the drive, motor overheating or trigger the d rive’s protection function.

 15-3 15-1 CANopen Overview  
 CANopen Protocol  
     CANopen is a CAN-based higher layer protocol, and was designed for motion-oriented 
machine control networks such as handling systems. Version 4.02 of CANopen (CiA DS301) is standardized as EN50325-4. The CANopen specifications cover the application layer and communication profile (CiA DS301), as well as a framework for programmable devices (CiA DS302), recommendations for cables and connectors (CiA DS303-1) and SI units and prefix representations (CiA DS303-2).

 15-4 NMT (Network Management Object)  
The Network Management (NMT) follows a Master/Slave structure for executing NMT service. A 
network has only one NMT master, and the other nodes are slaves. All CANopen nodes have a 
present NMT state, and the NMT master can c ontrol the state of the slave nodes. The following 
shows the state diagram of a node: 
 
(1) After power is applied, start in the auto-initialization state  (2) Automatically enter the pre-operational state
 
(3) (6) Start remote node (4) (7) Enter the pre-operational state (5) (8) Stop remote node (9) (10) (11) Reset node (12) (13) (14) Reset communication (15) Automatically enter the reset application state (16) Automatically enter the reset communication state

 15-5 SDO (Service Data Objects)  
Use SDO to access the Object Dictionary in every CANopen node using the Client/Server model. 
One SDO has two COB-IDs (request SDO and response SDO) to upload or download data between 
two nodes. There is no data limit for SDOs to transfer data, but it must transfer data by segment when the data exceeds four bytes with an end signal in the last segment. However, MS300 series does not support transferring data by segment. 
The Object Dictionary (OD) is a group of objects in a CANopen node. Every node has an OD in 
the system, and OD contains all parameters describing the device and its network behavior. The access path in the OD is the index and sub-index; each object has a unique index in the OD, and has a sub-index if necessary.

PDO (Process Data Objects)  
PDO communication can be described by the producer/consumer model. Each node of the 
network listens to the messages of the transmission node and distinguishes whether the message has to be processed or not after receiving the message. A PDO can be transmitted from one device to one another device or to many other devices. Every PDO has two PDO services: a TxPDO and an RxPDO. PDOs are transmitted in a non-confirmed mode. All transmission ty pes are listed in the 
following table 
Type Number PDO 
Cyclic Acyclic Synchronous Asynchronous RTR only

1–240 ○  ○   
241–251 Reserved 
252   ○  ○ 
253    ○ ○ 
254    ○  
255    ○  
 Type number 1–240 indicates the number of SYNC message between two PDO transmissions.  
 Type number 252 indicates the data is updated (but not sent) immediately after receiving SYNC.  
 Type number 253 indicates the data is updated immediately after receiving RTR.  
 Type number 254: Delta CANopen does not support this transmission format. 
 Type number 255 indicates the data is an asynchronous transmission. 
All PDO transmission data must be mapped to the index with Object Dictionary.

15-3-1 CANopen Control Mode Selection  
There are two control modes for CANopen: the DS402 standard (Pr.09-40=1) is the default, and the 
Delta’s standard setting (Pr.09-40=0). There are two control modes according to Delta’s standard. One is the old control mode (Pr.09-30=0); this control mode can only control the motor drive under the frequency control. The other mode is a new standard (Pr.09-30=1); this new control mode allows the motor drive to be controlled under all kinds of modes. The MS300 currently supports the speed mode. For torque, position and home mode, refer to MH300 series. The following table shows the 
control mode definitions:

 15-9 15-3-2 DS402 Standard Control Mode 
15-3-2-1 Related settings for an AC mo tor drive (following the DS402 standard)  
If you want to use the DS402 standard to control the motor drive, follow these steps: 
1. Wire the hardware (refer to Section 15-2 Wiring for CANopen). 
2. Set the operation source: set Pr.00-21 to 3 for CANopen communication card control. 3. Set the frequency source: set Pr.00-20 to 6. Choose the source for the Frequency command 
from the CANopen setting. 
4. Set DS402 as the control mode: Pr.09-40=1 5. Set the CANopen station: set Pr.09-36; the range is between 1–127. When Pr.09-36 = 0, the 
CANopen slave function is disabled. Note that if an error appears (station address error CAdE or CANopen memory error CFrE) when you finish the station setting, set Pr.00-02 = 7 to reset. 
6. Set the CANopen baud rate: set Pr.09-37 (CANBUS baud rate: 1 M (0), 500 K (1), 250 K (2), 
125 K (3), 100 K (4) or 50 K (5)). 
7. Set the multiple input functions to Quick Stop. You can also choose to enable or disable; the 
default setting is disabled. If it is necessary to enable the function, set MI terminal to 53 in one of the following parameters: Pr.02-01–02-07. Note that this function is available in DS402 only. 
 
15-3-2-2 The status of the motor drive (following t he DS402 standard) 
According to the DS402 definition, the motor drive is divided into 3 blocks and 9 
statuses as described below. 
3 blocks 
1. Power Disable: without PWM output 2. Power Enable: with PWM output 3. Fault: one or more errors have occurred.  
9 statuses 
1. Start: power on 2. Not Ready to Switch On: the motor drive is initiating. 3. Switch On Disable: occurs when the motor drive finishes initiating.  4. Ready to Switch On: warming up before running. 5. Switch On: the motor drive has the PWM output, but the reference command is not 
effective. 
6. Operation Enable: able to control normally. 7. Quick Stop Active: when there is a Quick Stop request, stop running the motor drive. 8. Fault Reaction Active: the motor drive detects conditions which might trigger error(s). 9. Fault: one or more errors have occurred in the motor drive.

 15-10  When the motor drive turns on and finishes the initiation, it remains in Ready to Switch On 
status. To control the operation of the motor drive, change to Operation Enable status. To do this, 
set the control word's bit0–bit3 and bit7 of the Index 6040H and pair with Index Status Word (Status Word 0X6041). The control steps and index definition are described below.

Set command 6040 = 0xE, and then set another command 6040 = 0xF. Then you can switch the 
motor drive to Operation Enable. The Index 605A determines the direction of the lines from Operation Enable when the control mode changes from Quick Stop Active. When the setting value is 1–3, both direction lines are active, but when the setting value of 605A is not 1–3, once the motor drive is switched to Quick Stop Active, it is not able to switch back to Operation Enable.

2. Switch to Operation Enable mode: set 6040 = 0xE, and then set 6040 = 0xF. 3. Set the target frequency: set target frequency for 6042. Since the operation unit of 6042 is rpm, 
a conversion is required. 
      s/minute) evolution n: rotation speed (rpm) (r 
p120f n× =   
P: number of poles of the motor (Pole) 
 f: rotation frequency (Hz) 
For example:  
Set 6042H = 1500 (rpm), if the number of poles for the drive is 4 (Pr.05-04, Pr.05-16, Pr.05-67 or Pr.05-73), then the motor drive's operation frequency is 1500 (120/4) = 50 Hz. The 6042 is defined as a signed operation. The plus or minus sign means to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise. 
4. To set acceleration and deceleration: use 604F (Acceleration) and 6050 (Deceleration). 
5. Trigger an ACK signal: in the speed control mode, control the bit 6–4 of Index 6040. It is 
defined below.

15-3-3-1 Various mode control method (following the Delta old standard)  
If you want to use the Delta old standard to control the motor drive, follow these steps: 
1. Wire the hardware (refer to Section 15-2 Wiring for CANopen ). 
2. Set the operation source: set Pr.00-21 to 3 for CANopen communication card control. 
3. Set the frequency source: set Pr.00-20 to 6. Choose the source for the Frequency command 
from the CANopen setting. 
4. Set Delta Standard (Old definition, only supports speed mode) as the control mode: Pr.09-40 
= 0 and Pr.09-30 = 0. 
5. Set the CANopen station: set Pr.09-36; the range is between 1–127. When Pr.09-36 = 0, the 
CANopen slave function is disabled. Note that if an error appears (station address error CAdE or CANopen memory error CFrE) when you finish the station setting, set Pr.00-02 = 7 to reset. 
6. Set the CANopen baud rate: set Pr.09-37 (CANBUS baud rate: 1 M (0), 500 K (1), 250 K (2), 
125 K (3), 100 K (4) and 50 K (5))  
15-3-3-2 The control method under speed mode  
1.  Set the target frequency: set 2020-02, the unit is Hz, with 2 decimal places. For example, 
1000 is 10.00 Hz. 
2.  Operation control: set 2020-01 = 0002H for running, and set 2020-01 = 0001H for stopping.

 15-15  15-3-5 Control DI / DO / AI / AO through CANopen  
To control the DO and AO of the motor drive through CANopen, follow these steps: 
1. Define the DO to be controlled by CANopen. For example, set Pr.02-13 = 50 to control RY1. 
2. Define the AO to be controlled by CANopen. For example, set Pr.03-20 = 20 to control AFM. 
3. Control the Index mapped by CANopen. To cont rol DO, use control Index 2026-41. To control AO, 
use control 2026-A1. To set RY1 as ON, set bit 0 of Index 2026-41 = 1, then RY1 outputs 1. To 
control AFM output = 50.00%, set Index 2026-A1 = 5000, then AFM outputs 50%. 
The following table shows the mapping of CANopen DI / DO / AI / AO:

 16-3  16-2  Notes Before Using a PLC  
1. The MS300 provides two communication serial ports that you c an use to download programs to 
the PLC (see Figure 16-1 below). 
2. Channel 1 (USB port) communication format is the same as cha nnel 2.  
3. Channel 2 has a preset communication format of 7, N, 2, 9600; you can change to ASCII in 
Pr.09-01 (transmission speed) and Pr.09-04 (communication proto col). 
4. The PLC preset is node 2; you can change the PLC node in Pr.09-35 (PLC address), but this 
address may not be the same as the drive’s address setting in P r.09-00 (communication 
address).  
 
Figure 16-1  
5. The host controller can simultaneously access data from the drive and the internal PLC, using 
the identifier for the node. For instance, if the drive node is  1 and the internal PLC node is 2, 
then the host controller command depends on the node address: 
 01 (node) 03 (read) 0400 (address) 0001 (1 data item), indicat ing that it must read the data 
in drive Pr.04-00.  
 02 (node) 03 (read) 0400 (address) 0001 (1 data item), indicat ing that it must read the data 
in internal PLC X0.  
6. The PLC program is disabled when uploading / downloading pro grams.   
7. Note that when using WPR commands to write parameters, you may modify values up to a 
maximum of 109 times; otherwise, after which a memory write error occurs. The  number of 
modifications depends on whether the parameter value has changed. If you do not change the value, it does not change the number of modifications; however, if the entered value is different from before, the number of modifications increases by one. 
8. When you set Pr.00-04 to 28, the displayed value is the value of PLC register D1043, as shown 
in Figure 16-2 below).

9. In the PLC Run and PLC Stop mode, you cannot set Pr.00-02 to the values 9 or 10, and cannot 
be reset to the default value.  
10. You can reset the PLC to the default value when you set Pr. 00-02 to 6.  
11. The corresponding MI function is disabled when the PLC writes to input contact X.  
12. When the PLC controls the drive operation, the control comm ands are entirely controlled by the 
PLC and are not affected by the setting for Pr.00-21.  
13. When the PLC controls the drive’s Frequency commands (FREQ commands), the Frequency 
commands are entirely controlled by the PLC, and are not affected by the setting for Pr.00-20 or the HAND ON / OFF configuration.  
14. When the PLC controls the drive operation, if the keypad ST OP setting is valid, this triggers 
a FStP error and causes the drive to stop.

Using the MS300 digital keypad to implement the PLC functions   When the PLC screen from the keypad is set to PLC0 (or “Disable” on KPC-CC01), the 
built-in PLC is disabled and you cannot use WPLSoft or ISPSoft to connect to it. 
 When the PLC screen from the keypad is set to PLC1 (or “PLC Ru n“ on KPC-CC01), 
the built-in PLC is enabled and you can use WPLSoft or ISPSoft to connect to it 
through Modbus. 
 When the PLC screen from the keypad is set to PLC2 (or “PLC St op” on KPC-CC01), 
the built-in PLC is enabled and you can use WPLSoft or ISPSoft to connect to it. 
However, the programs in the built-in PLC do not work. 
 When the built-in PLC is enabled (PLC1 or PLC2), you can switc h between PLC Run 
or PLC Stop through WPLSoft or ISPSoft.   
 The external terminal control method is the same as shown in Table 16-2 above.  
NOTE 
 When the input / output terminals (MI1–MI7, Relay, and MO) are included in the PLC program, these 
input / output terminals are used only by the PLC. For example,  when the PLC program controls Y0 
during PLC operation (PLC1 or PLC2), the corresponding output t erminal relay (RA / RB / RC) 
operates according to the program. At this time, the multifunct ional input / output terminal setting has 
no effect. Because these terminal functions are already being u sed by the PLC, you can determine 
the DI / DO / AO in use by the PLC by looking at Pr.02-52, 02-5 3, and 03-30.  
 When the PLC program uses special register D1040, the correspon ding AO contact AFM is 
occupied.

16-4-2 Introduction to ladder diagrams  
Ladder diagrams use a graphic language widely applied in automa tic controls. They employ 
common electrical control circuit symbols. After you use a ladder diagram editor to create a ladder diagram program, the PLC program design is complete. Using a gr aphic format to control processes 
is very intuitive and is readily accepted by personnel who are familiar with electrical control circuit technology. Many of the basic symbols and actions in a ladder d iagram mimic common electrical 
devices in conventional automatic control power distribution pa nels, such as buttons, switches, 
relays, timers, and counters.  
Internal PLC devices: The types and quantities of internal PLC devices vary in different brands of 
products. Although these internal devices use the same names as the conventional electrical control circuit elements (such as relays, coils, and contacts), a PLC d oes not actually contain these physical 
devices, and they instead correspond to basic elements in the P LC's internal memory (bits). For 
instance, if a bit is 1, this may indicate that a coil is electrified; and if that bit is 0, it indicates that the coil is not electrified. You can use a N.O. contact (Normally O pen, or contact A) to directly read the 
value of the corresponding bit, and use a NC contact (Normally Closed, or contact B) to get the inverse of the bit’s value. Multiple relays occupy multiple bit s, and eight bits comprise one byte. Two 
bytes comprise one word, and two words comprise a double word. When multiple relays are 
processing at the same time (as in addition/subtraction or disp lacement), it can use a byte, a word, or 
a double word. Furthermore, a PLC contains two types of internal devices: a timer and a counter. It not only has a coil, but can count time and numerical values. B ecause of this, when it is necessary to 
process numerical values, these values are usually in the form of bytes, words, or double words (internally in the PLC).

 16-17  The various internal devices in a PLC use a certain amount of memory in the PLC’s storage area. 
When you use these devices, the content of the corresponding st orage area is read in the form of bits, 
bytes, or words.  
Table 16-5 describes the internal devices in a PLC 
Device 
Type  Description of Function 
Input 
Relay An input relay constitutes the basic unit of storage in a PLC's  internal memory, and 
corresponds to an external input point. It serves as a terminal  connecting with an 
external input switch and receiving external input signals. It is driven by external input 
signals, to which it assigns values of 0 or 1. A program design  method cannot change 
the input relay status, and therefore cannot rewrite the corres ponding basic units of an 
input relay. You cannot use WPLSoft to manually perform ON/OFF actions. You can use 
a relay's contacts (contacts A and B) an unlimited number of ti mes in a program. An 
input relay with no input signal must be left idle and cannot b e used for some other 
purpose. 
 Input devices are indicated by X0, X1, X7, X10, X11, and so on. These devices are 
indicated with the symbol X, and a device's order is indicated with an octal number. 
Input point numbers are indicated in the main PLC and in expans ion devices. 
Output 
Relay An output relay constitutes the basic unit of storage in a PLC' s internal memory, and 
corresponds to an external output point. It connects with an external load. It can be driven by an input relay contact, a contact on another internal device, or its own contacts. It uses one N.O. contact to connect with external loads or other contacts, and like the input contacts, you can use the output relay’s contact s an unlimited number of 
times in a program. An output relay with no input signal is idle, but can be used by an internal relay if needed.  Output devices are indicated by Y0, Y1, Y7, Y10, Y11, and so on. These devices are 
indicated with the symbol Y, and a device's order is indicated with an octal number. 
Output point numbers are indicated in the main PLC and in expan sion devices. 
Internal 
Relay Internal relays have no direct connection with the outside. The se relays are auxiliary 
relays inside a PLC. Their function is the same as that of an a uxiliary (central) relay in 
an electrical control circuit: Each auxiliary relay corresponds to a basic unit of internal storage; they can be driven by input relay contacts, output rel ay contacts, and the 
contacts of other internal devices. You can use an internal aux iliary relay's contacts an 
unlimited number of times in a program. Internal relays have no  outputs to the outside, 
and their status must output through an output point.   Internal relay devices are indicated by: M0, M1–M799, and so o n. These devices 
are indicated with the symbol M, and the device’s order is indicated with a decimal number. 
Counter Counters perform counting operations. The setting value for a counter (such as the number of pulses to be counted) must be assigned when a counter is used. A counter contains a coil, contact, and a counting storage device. When t he coil goes from OFF  
ON, this indicates that the counter receives an input pulse, and adds one to its count. There are 16 bits available in the counter.  Counter device are indicated by: C0, C1–C79, and so on. These devices are 
indicated by the symbol C, and the device’s order is indicated with a decimal 
number.

 16-18Device 
Type  Description of Function 
Timer Timers perform timing for operations. The timer contains a coil , contact, and a time 
value register. When the coil is electrified, and the setting v alue for the timer is reached, 
the contact is actuated (contact A closes, contact B opens), an d the timer's fixed value is 
given by the setting value. A timer has a regulated clock cycle (timing units: 100 ms). As 
soon as power to the coil is cut off, the contact is no longer be actuated (contact A opens, contact B closes), and the original timing value returns  to zero. 
 Timer devices are indicated by: T0, T1–T159, and so on. These devices are 
indicated by the symbol T, and the device’s order is indicated with a decimal 
number. 
Data 
register Data registers are used exclusively to store data and various p arameters. When you 
use a PLC is to perform various types of sequence control, set time values, and count 
value controls, the PLC performs data processing and numerical operations and stores the operands, parameters, and results in data registers. Each data register contains 16 bits of binary data (one word). Two data registers with adjacen t numbers can process 
double words.  Data register devices are indicated by: D0, D1– D399, and so o n. These devices are 
indicated by the symbol D, and the device’s order is indicated with a decimal 
number.

 16-2016-4-3 Overview of PLC l adder diagram editing 
The program editing method in WPLSoft begins from the left busb ar and proceeds to the right busbar 
(the right busbar is not visible in WPLSoft). Continue to the n ext row after completing each row; there 
are a maximum of 11 contacts on each row. If this is not suffic ient, WPLSoft generates a continuous 
line to indicate the continued connection, so that you can add more devices. A continuous series of 
numbers is generated automatically and you can use identical in put points repeatedly (as shown in 
the following diagram).  
 
Figure 16-27  
The PLC scans a ladder diagram programs from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. The coils and application command computing box are handled in the output, and in the ladder diagram 
are placed on the farthest right of a rung. Taking the diagram below as an example, we can analyze 
the procedural sequence of the ladder diagram. The number in the upper right corner gives the sequential order.

 16-22In the case of ANB and ORB operations that connect a number of blocks, they should be combined 
to form a block or network from the top down or from left to ri ght.  
MPS, MRD, MPP commands:  branching point memory for multiple outputs that enable multip le 
different outputs. The MPS command begins at a branching point,  which refers to the intersection of 
horizontal and vertical lines. Control relies on the contact status along a single vertical line to 
determine whether the next contact can give a memory command. W hile each contact is basically 
able to give memory commands, in view of convenience and the PL C's capacity restrictions, this can 
be omitted from some places when editing a ladder diagram. You can use the structure of the ladder diagram to judge what kinds of contact memory commands are used .  
MPS is indicated by use of the ┬ symbol. You can use this comma nd consecutively up to eight times.  
The MRD command is read from branching point memory; because lo gic states along any one 
vertical line must be the same, in order to continue analysis o f other parts of the ladder diagram, the 
original contact status must be read. MRD is indicated by the ├  symbol.  
The MPP command is read from the starting state of the uppermost branching point, and it is read from the stack (pop operation); because it is the final command along a vertical line, it indicates that the state of the vertical line can be concluded. MPP is indicat ed by the └ symbol.  
Although there should basically be no errors when using the for egoing analytical approach, the 
compiling program may sometimes omit identical state output, as  shown in the following diagram.

16-4-4 Common basic program design examples 
Start, stop, and protection circuits 
Some applications may require a brief close or brief break usin g a button to start and stop equipment. 
A protective circuit must therefore be designed to maintain continued operation in these situations. This protective circuit may employ one of the following methods .  
Example 1: Priority stop protective circuit  
When the start N.O. contact X1=ON, and the stop N.C. contact X2=OFF, Y1=ON. If X2 switches to ON, coil Y1 is no longer electrified, and this is t herefore referred to as priority 
stop.

 16-23  Example 2: Priority start protective circuit  
When the start N.O. contact X1=ON, and the stop N.C. contact X2＝OFF, Y1=ON, and 
coil Y1 is electrified and protected. If X2 switches to ON, coi l Y1 still protects the contact 
and continues to be electrified, and this is therefore referred  to as priority start.

Figure 16-37  
Example 3: Setting (SET) and reset (RST) command protective cir cuit  
The following diagram shows a protective circuit composed of RS T and SET commands.  
A priority stop occurs when you place the RST command after the  SET command. 
Because the PLC executes programs from the top down, at the end of the program, the 
state of Y1 indicates whether coil Y1 is electrified. When X1 and X2 both actuate, Y1  loses power, and this is therefore referred to as priority stop .  
A priority start occurs when you place the SET command after the RST command. When X1 and X2 both actuate, Y1 electrifies, and this is therefore referred to as priority start.

Commonly used control circuits   
Example 4: Conditional control  
X1 and X3 respectively start and stop Y1; and X2 and X4 respect ively start and stop Y2. 
All have protective circuits. Because Y1's N.O. contact is in series with Y2's circuit, it becomes an AND condition for the actuation of Y2. The action of  Y1 is therefore a 
condition for the action of Y2, and Y1 must actuate before Y2 c an actuate.

Example 5: Interlocking control  
The diagram below shows an interlocking control circuit. Depend ing on which of the start 
contacts X1 or X2 becomes valid first, the corresponding output  Y1 or Y2 actuates, and 
when one actuates, the other does not actuate. Y1 and Y2 cannot  actuate at the same 
time (interlocking effect). Even if both X1 and X2 are valid at  the same time, because the 
ladder diagram program is scanned from the top down, it is impo ssible for Y1 and Y2 to 
actuate at same time. This ladder diagram assigns priority only  to Y1.

Example 6: Sequence control  
If the N.C. contact of Y2 in the interlocking control configura tion from example 5 is put in 
series with the Y1 circuit, to create an AND condition for actuation of Y1 (see diagram 
below), not only is Y1 a condition for the actuation of Y2 in t his circuit, but the actuation of 
Y2 also stops the actuation of Y1. This configuration confirms the actuation order of Y1 
and Y2.

 16-25  Example 7: Oscillating circuit  
Oscillating circuit with a period of ΔT+ΔT  
The diagram below shows a very simple ladder diagram. When starting to scan the 
Y1 N.C. contact, because the Y1 coil has lost power, the Y1 N.C. contact is closed. When 
the Y1 coil is then scanned, it is electrified, and the output is 1. When the Y1 N.C. contact 
is scanned in the next scanning cycle, because the Y1 coil is e lectrified, the Y1 N.C. 
contact is open, the Y1 coil then loses power, and the output i s 0. Following repeated 
scanning, the output of Y1 coil has an oscillating waveform wit h a period of 
ΔT(ON)+ΔT(OFF).

Figure 16-43  
 Oscillating circuit with a period of nT+ΔT  The ladder diagram shown below uses timer T0 to control coil Y1 's electrified time. After 
Y1 is electrified, it causes timer T0 to close during the next scanning cycle, which causes the output from Y1 to oscillate as shown in the diagram below. The constant n is the timer's decimal setting value, and T is the clock cycle of the timer.

Example 8: Flashing circuit  
The following diagram shows an oscillating circuit of a type co mmonly used to cause an 
indicator to flash or a buzzer to buzz. It uses two timers to c ontrol the ON and OFF time of 
Y1 coil. Here constants n1 and n2 are the setting values of tim ers T1 and T2, and T is the 
clock cycle of the timer.

 16-26Example 9: Triggering circuit  
In the diagram below, a rising edge in input X0 causes coil M0 to generate a single pulse 
for ΔT (length of one scanning cycle), and coil Y1 is electrified during this scanning cycle. 
Coil M0 loses power during the next scanning cycle, and N.C. co ntact M0 and N.C. 
contact Y1 are both closed. This causes coil Y1 to stay in an e lectrified state until there is 
another rising edge in input X0. This again causes the electrif ication of coil M0 and the 
start of another scanning cycle, while also causing coil Y1 to lose power, and so on. You can see the sequence of these actions in the diagram below. Thi s type of circuit is 
commonly used to enable one input to perform two alternating ac tions. You can see from 
the time sequence in the diagram below that when input X0 is a square wave signal with a period of T, the output of coil Y1 is a square wave signal with a period of 2T.

Example 10: Delay circuit  
When input X0 is ON, because the corresponding NC contact is OF F, the timer T10 is in 
a no power state, and output coil Y1 is electrified. T10 receiv es power and begins to 
counter the time only after input X0 is OFF, and output coil Y1 is delayed for 100 seconds (K1000*0.1 sec. =100 sec.) before losing power. You can  see the sequence of 
actions in the diagram below.

Input contact X has this function: input contact X is connected with an input device, and reads input 
signals entering the PLC. There are no restrictions on the number of times that the input contact A or B appear in the program. The ON/OFF state of input contact X ch anges as the input device switches 
between ON and OFF; you cannot use a peripheral device (WPLSoft) to force contact X ON or OFF.

The output contact Y sends an ON/OFF signal to drive the load connected to output contact Y. There are two types of output contacts: relays and transistors. There are no restrictions on the number of times that contact A or B of an output contact Y appear in a pr ogram, but it is recommended that you 
use the number of output coil Y only once in a program; otherwi se the output state when the PLC 
performs program scanning is determined by the program's final output Y circuit.

Table 16-9 
The PLC uses five types of numerical values to implement calcul ations based on its control tasks; the 
following topics explain the use and function of the different numerical values.  
Binary Number, BIN 
The PLC's numerical operations and memory employ binary numbers . The following table explains 
terms related to binary numbers. 
bit Bits are the fundamental units of binary values, and have a state of either 1 or 0. 
Nibble Comprised of a series of 4 bits (such as b3–b0); can be used to  express a 
one-nibble decimal number 0–9 or hexadecimal number: 0–F.  
Byte Comprised of a series of two nibbles (i.e. 8 bits, b7–b0); can express a 
hexadecimal number: 00-FF.  
Word Comprised of a series of two bytes (i.e. 16 bits, b15–b0); can express a hexadecimal number with four nibbles: 0000–FFFF.  
Double Word Comprised of a series of two words (i.e. 32 bits, b31–b0); can express a hexadecimal number with eight nibbles: 00000000–FFFFFFFF

External output:  Y0–Y7, Y10–Y17…(Device number table) 
Decimal Number, DEC A PLC uses decimal numbers for the following purposes:  
 The setting values of timer T or counter C, such as TMR C0 K50 (K constant). 
 The numbers of devices including M, T, C, or D, such as M10 or T30 (device number). 
 An operand in an application command, such as MOV K123 D0 (K co nstant). 
Binary Coded Decimal, BCD Uses one nibble or four bits to express the data in a decimal n umber; a series of 16 bits can therefore 
express a decimal number with four nibbles. These are used to read the input value of a rotating 
numerical switch to input or output a numerical value to a seve n-segment display drive.  
Hexadecimal Number, HEX A PLC uses hexadecimal numbers as operands in application comma nds, such as MOV H1A2B D0 
(H constant). 
Constant K PLC’s usually prefixed decimal numbers with K, such as K100. Th is indicates that it is a decimal 
number with a numeric value of 100.  
Exceptions: You can combine K with a bit device X, Y, M, or S to produce data in the form of a nibble, 
byte, word, or double word, such as in the case of K2Y10 or K4M 100. Here K1 
represents a 4-bit combination, and K2–K4 represent 8-, 12-, and 16-bit combinations.  
Constant H 
PLC’s usually prefixed hexadecim al numbers with H, such as in the case of H100. This indicates a 
hexadecimal number with a numeric value of 100.

 16-31  Functions of auxiliary relays  
Like an output relay Y, an auxiliary relay M has an output coil  and contacts A and B, and you can use 
the output relay contacts any number of times in a program. You  can use an auxiliary relay M to 
configure the control circuit, but cannot use the auxiliary relay to directly drive an external load. There 
are two types of auxiliary relays:  
Ordinary auxiliary relays: ordi nary auxiliary relays all revert  to the OFF state when a power outage 
occurs while the PLC is running, and remains in the OFF state when power 
is restored.  
Special purpose auxiliary relays: each special purpose auxiliary relay has its own specific use. Do not 
use any undefined special purpose auxiliary relays.  
Timer functions  
Timers use 100 ms as their timing unit. When the timing method is an upper time limit, and the 
current timer value = setting value, the timer output coil is e nergized. Timer setting values use 
decimal K values; you can also use the data register D as a setting value.  
Actual timer setting time = timing units * set value 
Counter features  
Item 16-bit counter 
Type General Type 
CT Direction: Up  
Setting 0–32,767 
Designation of set value Constant K or data register D 
Change in current value When the count reaches the setting valu e, it stops counting. 
Output contact When the count reaches the setting value, the contact switches ON and stays 
ON. 
Reset The current value reverts to 0 when an RST command is executed,  and the 
contact reverts to OFF. 
Contact actuation All are actuated after the end of scanning. 
Table 16-11 
Counter functions 
When a counter's counting pulse input signal switches from OFF to ON, if the counter's current value 
is equal to the setting value, the output coil switches ON. The setting value can be either a decimal K 
or a data register D. 
16-bit counter: 
 16-bit counter setting range: K0–K32,767. When K0 and K1 are i dentical, the output contact is 
immediately ON during the first count. 
 The current counter value is cleared from an ordinary counter when power to the PLC turns 
OFF.  
 If you use the MOV command or WPLSoft to transmit a value grea ter than the setting value to 
the C0 current value register, when the next X1 switches from O FF to ON, the C0 counter 
contact changes to ON, and the current value changes to the set ting value.

 16-32 You can set a counter's setting value directly using a constant K, or indirectly using the value in 
register D (not including special data registers D1000–D1199 or  D2000–D2799).  
 If the setting value is a constant K, the value must be a posi tive number. If the setting value is 
from data register D, the value can be either a positive or neg ative number. If using a data 
register, and the current value is 32,767, incrementing the cou nt causes the count value to roll 
over to -32,768 as the count continues to accumulate.

1. When X0 = ON and the RST command 
is executed, the current value of C0 
reverts to 0, and the output contact reverts to OFF. 
2. When X1 switches from OFF to ON, 
the current value of the counter is incremented by one (add one). 
3. When the count in C0 reaches the set 
value K5, the contact C0 switches to ON, and the current value of C0 = setting value = K5.  Afterwards, additional changes in X1 do not affect the count value, and C0 remains at K5. X0

 MC is the main control initiation command, and any command betw een MC and MCR 
is executed normally. When the MC command is OFF, any command b etween MC 
and MCR acts as follows:  
Determination of commands Description 
Ordinary timer  The timing value reverts to 0, the coil loses power, 
and the contact does not operate. 
Counter The coil loses power, and the count value and 
contact stay in their current state. 
Coil driven by OUT command None receives power.  
Elements driven by SET, RST 
commands They remain in their current state. 
Application commands  None are actuated. 
MCR is the main control stop command, and is placed at the end of the main control 
program. There may not be any contact command prior to the MCR command.  
The MC-MCR main control program commands support a nested program structure with a maximum of only eight levels; use in the order N0–N7. Re fer to the following

A contact-driven command is not needed. 
  This command indicates the end of the main program. It is the same as 
the END command when the PLC executes this command.  
 The CALL command program must be written after the FEND comman d, 
and the SRET command is added to the end of the subprogram.  
 When using the FEND command, an END command is also needed. 
However, the END command must be placed at the end, after the main 
program and subprogram.

Notes on operand usage:  
The operand D occupies three consecutive points  
  S1: Compare value 1. S2 : Compare value 2.  D: Results of comparison.  
 Compares the size of the content of operand  S1 and S2 ; stores the results of the 
comparison in  D.  
 Size comparison is performed algebraically. All data is compar ed in the form of 
numerical binary values. Because this is a 16-bit command, when  b15 is 1, this 
indicates a negative number.  
  When the designated device is Y0, it automatically occupies Y0, Y1 and Y2.  
 When X10=ON, the CMP command executes, and Y0, Y1 or Y2 is ON.  When 
X10=OFF, the CMP command does not execute, and the state of Y0,  Y1 and Y2 
remain in the state prior to X10=OFF.

 16-89    When starting the PLC program for the first time, M0 is trigge red to ON and 
executes one MODRW command. 
 After receiving the slave device's response, if the command is  correct, it executes 
one ROL command, which triggers M1 to ON.  
 After receiving the slave device's response and after a delay of 10 PLC scanning 
cycles, M50 =1 is triggered, and it executes one MODRW command.   
 After receiving the slave device's response again, if the comm and is correct, it 
executes one ROL command, which triggers M2 to ON (M2 can be de fined as a 
repeat of M). Then, K4M0 changes to K1 again, and only M0 remai ns 1. This 
enables the transmission to proceed in a continuous cycle. If you need to add a 
sending command, just add the desired command in the frame with  a dotted line, 
and change repeat M to Mn+1.

  When the data in the MS300 drive's parameter H01.00 is read and written to 
D0, data from H01.01 is read and written to D1.  
 When M0=ON, the content of D10 is written to the MS300 drive P r.04.00 (first 
speed of multiple speed levels).  
 When M1017=ON, the parameter has been written successfully.  
 The MS300's WPR command does not support writing to the 20XX a ddress, 
but the RPR command supports reading of 21XX, 22XX, 61XX.

 16-102Recommendation: Be cautious when using the WPR command. When wr iting parameters, most 
parameters are recorded when they are written, and these parame ters may only 
be revised 106 times: a memory write error may occur if parameters are writte n 
more than (MS)106 or (MH)109 times.  
The following commonly-used parameters have special treatment, so there are 
no limits for the number of times that they can be written.  
Pr.00-10: Control method 
Pr.00-11: Speed mode selection Pr.00-27: User-defined value Pr.01-12: Acceleration time 1 Pr.01-13: Deceleration time 1 Pr.01-14: Acceleration time 2 Pr.01-15: Deceleration time 2 Pr.01-16: Acceleration time 3 Pr.01-17: Deceleration time 3 Pr.01-18: Acceleration time 4 Pr.01-19: Deceleration time 4 Pr.02-12: Select MI Conversion Time mode  Pr.02-18: Select MO Conversion Time mode  Pr.04-50–Pr.04-69: PLC register parameter 0–19 Pr.08-04: Upper limit of integral control Pr.08-05: PID output upper limit  Pr.10-17: Electronic gear A  Pr.10-18: Electronic gear B Pr.11-34: Torque command 
The number of times a parameter is written is based on whether the written value is modified. For 
instance, writing the same value 100 times at the same time counts as writing only once. When writing a PLC program, if you are not sure the usage of the WPR command, it is recommended that you use the WPRP command.

has been cleared to 0. This is written to the FREQ command when  the PLC 
is ON.  
bit 1 :  Prior to PLC scanning procedures, acts on whether the target torque has 
been cleared to 0. This is written to the TORQ command when the  PLC is 
ON.  
bit 2 :  Prior to PLC scanning procedures, acts on whether speed limits in the 
torque mode have been cleared to 0. This is written to the TORQ  command 
when the PLC is ON.

If we force M0 to 1, the frequency command is 20.00 Hz; but whe n M0 is set to 0, 
there is a different situation.  
          Case 1: When the Pr.09-33 bit 0 is 0, and M0 is set a s 0, then the frequency 
command remains at 20.00 Hz.  
          Case 2: When the Pr.09-33 bit 0 is 1, and M0 is set a s 0, then the frequency 
command changes to 0.00 Hz 
           This is because when the Pr.09-33 bit 0 is 1 prior to PLC scanning procedures, the 
frequency first reverts to 0.  
           When the Pr.09-33 bit 0 is 0, the frequency does not  revert to 0.

Example of speed mode control:  
Before using speed control, if you use the FOC (magnetic field orientation) control method, you must 
first complete the setting of the electro-mechanical parameters .   
1. Setting D1060 = 0 shifts the drive to speed mode (default).  
2. Use the FREQ command to control frequency, acceleration time, and deceleration time.  
3. Setting M1040 = 1, the drive is now excited, but the frequen cy is 0.  
4. Setting M1025 = 1, the drive Frequency command now jumps to the frequency designated 
by FREQ, and acceleration and deceleration is controlled on the  basis of the acceleration time 
and deceleration time specified by FREQ.  
5. Use M1052 to lock the current operation frequency.

 16-109  16-9  Count Function Using Pulse Input  
1 6 - 9 - 1    H i g h - s peed count function  
The MS300's MI7 supports one-way pulse counting with a maximum speed of 33 k. The starting 
method is very simple, and only requires setting M1038 to begin  counting. The 32-bit count value is 
stored in D1054 and D1055 in non-numerical form. M1039 resets the count value to 0. 
 
Current count value
of MI8(H word) 
 
※ When the PLC program defines MI7 for use as a high-speed count er, that is, when M1038 or 
M1039 is written in PLC procedures, other functions of MI7 are disabled.  
1 6 - 9 - 2    F r equency calculation function 
Apart from high-speed counting, the MS300's MI7 can also conver t a received pulse to a frequency. 
The following figure shows that there is no conflict between fr equency conversion and count 
calculations, which the MS300 can perform simultaneously.  
PLC speed calculation formula  
D1057 Speed D1058 Interval between calculations D1059 Decimal places Assume that there are five input pulses each second, (see figur e below) we set D1058 = 1000 ms = 
1.0 second as the calculation interval. This enables five pulse s to be sent to the drive each second.  
 
 
Assume that each five pulses correspond to 1 Hz, we set D1057 = 5.  Setting D1059 = 2 displays numbers to two decimal places, which  is also 1.00 Hz. The numerical 
value displayed at D1056 is 100. For simplicity, the D1059 conversion formula can be expressed in the following formula:

 17-11  17-8   Test and Fault Confirmation 
After wiring the STO circuit in accordance with Section 17-3 Wi ring Diagram, follow the steps below to 
verify that the STO and related detection functions work normal ly. 
1. When the drive is powered on, make sure that the S1–DCM and S2–DCM voltage falls between 
11–30 V DC. At this time, the drive should enter Standby mode and wait fo r RUN command. There 
is no error displayed on the keypad. 
2. Press RUN on the keypad and use the emergency button or othe r method to make the S1–DCM 
and S2–DCM voltage fall between 0–5 V DC. At the same time, after the output frequency is reached, 
the drive should enter Torque Stop mode STO and stop outputting voltage. The keypad displays 
the STO error, and the response time of the S1 and S2 signals t o cause the drive to stop outputting 
voltage should be ≤ 20 ms. Then restore the S1–DCM and S2–DCM v oltage to 11–30 V DC, and 
press RESET button on the keypad to clear the STO error. The dr ive should enter Standby mode 
and wait for RUN command.  
3. Press RUN on the keypad and use the emergency button or othe r method to make the S1–DCM 
voltage fall between 0–5 V DC, and the S2–DCM voltage remain between 11–30 V DC after the output 
frequency is reached. At this time, the drive should enter Torque Stop mode STL1 and stop outputting voltage. The keypad displays the STL1 error, and the  response time of S1 signals to 
cause the drive to stop outputting voltage should be ≤ 20 ms. Then restore the S1–DCM voltage to 11–30 V
DC. However, pressing RESET button on the keypad cannot clear the  STL1 error. You must 
cycle the power to the drive. Make sure that the S1–DCM and S2– DCM voltage falls between 11–
30 V DC and then cycle the power to the drive, then the STL1 error is cleared. The drive should enter 
Standby mode and wait for RUN command. 
4. Press RUN on the keypad and use the emergency button or othe r method to make the S2–DCM 
voltage fall between 0–5 V DC, and the S1–DCM voltage remain between 11–30 V DC after the output 
frequency is reached. At this time, the drive should enter Torque Stop mode STL2 and stop outputting voltage. The keypad displays the STL2 error, and the  response time of the S2 signals to 
cause the drive to stop outputting voltage should be ≤ 20 ms. Then restore the S2–DCM voltage to 11–30 V
DC. However, pressing RESET button on the keypad cannot clear the  STL2 error. You must 
cycle the power to the drive. Make sure that the S1–DCM and S2– DCM voltage falls between 11–
30 V DC and then cycle the power to the drive, then the STL2 error is cleared. The drive should enter 
Standby mode and wait for RUN command. 
5. If you can conduct these four steps normally in sequence wit h no other error, then the Safe Torque 
Off function loop is normal, as shown in Table 17-6 below. Howe ver, if a situation that differs from 
these four steps, or if STL3 occurs, then the Safe Torque Off f unction loop does not work normally. 
Refer to Section 17-7 Error Code and Troubleshooting Instructio ns for details.
