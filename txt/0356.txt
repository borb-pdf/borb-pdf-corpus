               I ifnally found a good life. I wished my parents could be 
               here, so that I could cook for them, and give them a good 
               life too. But my parents were no longer around. You know 
               what the Chinese think is the saddest feeling in the world? 
               It’s for a child to ifnally grow the desire to take care of his 
               parents, only to realize that they were long gone.

               how much joy your very existence brought to me? And can 
               you understand how it felt when you stopped talking to me 
               and won’t let me talk to you in Chinese? I felt I was losing 
               everything all over again.
                  Why won’t you talk to me, son? hTe pain makes it
