1.2 In Memoriam  
In October 2019, Dr. Woodie Flowers, an innovator in design and engineering education and a Distinguished Advisor to FIRST and supporter of our mission, passed away. As thousands of heartfelt 
tributes to Woodie have poured in from around the world, it is clear his legacy will live on indefinitely 
through the gracious nature of our community and our ongoing commitment to empow ering educators 
and building global citizens.  
Figure 1-1 Dr. Woodie Flowers, 1943- 2019  
 
1.3 FIRST® Robot ics Competition  
FIRST® Robotics  Competition combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and 
technology. Teams of students are challenged to design, build, and program industrial -size robots and 
compete for awards, while they also create a team identity, raise funds, hone teamwork skills, and 
advance respect and appreciation for STEM within the local community.  

 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 6 of 164 Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. It’s as close to real -
world engineering as a student can get. Plus, high school students gain access to exclusive scholarship 
opportunities from colleges, universities, and tech nical programs.  
Each January at an event known as “Kickoff,” a new, challenging game is introduced. These exciting 
competitions combine the practical application of science and technology with the fun, intense energy, 
and excitement of a championship -style sporting event.  Teams are encouraged to display Gracious 
Professionalism®, help other teams, and cooperate while competing. This is known as Coopertition®. 
In 2025 , FIRST Robotics  Competition is projected to reach approximately 9 0,000 high- school students 
representing approximately 3, 600 teams. Teams come from nearly every state in the United States, as 
well as many other countries.  
FIRST Robotics Competition teams will participate in 69  Regional Competitions, 103 District 
Competitions, and 1 2 District Championships. In addition, approximately 600 teams will qualify to 
attend the FIRST Championship in April 2025.  
This year’s game, and this manual, were presented at the 2025 FIRST  Robotics Competition Kickoff on 
Saturday, January 4, 2025 . 
At the Kickoff, all teams:  
− saw the 2025  game, REEFSCAPESM presented by Haas, for the first time,  
− learned about the 2025  game rules and regulations, and  
− received a set of game specific materials . 
1.4 Gracious Professionalism®, a FIRST  Credo  
Gracious Professionalism  is part of the ethos of FIRST. It’s a way of doing things that encourages high 
quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals and the community.  
Gracious Professionalism  is not clearly defined for a reason. It can and should mean different things to 
everyone.  
Some possible meanings of Gracious Professionalism include:  
− gracious attitudes and behaviors are win -win, 
− gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their actions,  
− professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to use that knowledge responsibly, and  
− gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing to others and to 
themselves.  
In the context of FIRST, this means that all teams and participants should:  
− learn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with respect and kindness in the 
process and  
− avoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or unappreciated.  
Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and genuinely blended.  
 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 7 of 164 In the end, Gracious Professionalism  is part of pursuing a meaningful life. When professionals use 
knowledge in a gracious manner and individuals act with integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and 
society benefits.  
Figure 1-2 Dr. Woodie Flowers , Gracious Professionalism advocate and exemplar  
 
“The FIRST spirit encourages doing high -quality, well- informed work in a manner that 
leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious Professionalism  seems to be a good descriptor 
for part of the ethos of FIRST . It is part of what makes FIRST different and wonderful. ” 
- Dr. Woodie Flowers, (1943 – 2019)  
Distinguished Advisor to FIRST 
It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with your team and reinforcing it regularly. We 
recommend providing your team with real -life examples of Gracious Professionalism  in practice, such 
as when a team loans valuable materials or expertise to another team that they will later face as an 
opponent in competition. Routinely highlight opportunities to display Gracious Professionalism  at 
events and encourage team members to suggest ways in which they can demonstrate this quality themselves and t hrough outreach activities.  
1.5 Coopertition® 
At FIRST, Coopertition  is displaying unqualified kindness and respect in the face of fierce competition. 
Coopertition  is founded on the concept and philosophy that teams can and should help and cooperate 
with one another even as they compete. Coopertition  involves learning from teammates and mentors. 
Coopertition  means competing always but assisting and enabling others when you can.  
Message from Woodie Flowers Award Recipients  
The Woodie Flowers Award is the most prestigious mentoring award in FIRST. The award recipients created an important message for all FIRST Robot ics Competition teams to 
consider as we tackle each season.  
Performing at your best is important. Winning is important. This is a competition.  
However, winning with Gracious Professionalism  and being proud of what you have 
accomplished and how you have accomplished it is more important. FIRST  could create 
rules and penalties to cover almost any scenario or situation, but we prefer an understandable game with simpler rules that allow us to think and be creative in our designs.  

 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 8 of 164 We want to know that our partners and opponents are playing at their best in every 
MATCH . We want to know they are playing with integrity and not using strategies based on 
questionable behaviors.  
As you create your ROBOTS  and award presentations, prepare for competition and MATCH  
play, create and implement game strategies, and live your daily lives, remember what Woodie said time and time again, and let’s ‘Make your Grandmother proud.’

1.7 This Document & Its Conventions  
The 2025  Game Manual is a resource for all FIRST  Robotics Competition teams for information specific 
to the 2025 season and the REEFSCAPE game. Its audience will find the following detail:  
− a general overview of the REEFSCAPE game,  
− detail about the REEFSCAPE playing FIELD,  
− a description of how to play the REEFSCAPE  game,  
− rules (related to safety, conduct, game play, inspection, event, etc.), and  
− a description of how teams advance at 2025 tournaments and throughout the season  
The intent of this manual is that the text means exactly, and only, what it says. Please avoid interpreting 
the text based on assumptions about intent, implementation of past rules, or how a situation might be in “real life.” There are no hidden requirements or restrictions. If you’ve read everything, you know 
everything.  
 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 10 of 164 Specific methods are used throughout this manual to highlight warnings, cautions, key words, and 
phrases. These conventions are used to alert the reader to important information and are intended help teams in constructing a ROBOT  that complies with the rules in a safe manner.  
Links to other section headings in this manual, external articles, and rule references appear  in blue 
underlined text . 
Key words that have a particular meaning within the context of the FIRST Robotics Competition and 
REEFSCAPE are defined in s ection 15 Glossary  and indicated in ALL CAPS throughout this document.  
The rule numbering method indicates the section, subsection, and position of the rule within that subsection. The letter indicates the section in which the rule is published.  
− Q for Section 6.7.1  Question Box  
− G for  Section 7 Game Rules  
− R for Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules   
− I for Section 9 Inspection & Eligibility   
− T for Section 10 Tournaments  
− C for Section 1 3 FIRST Championship Tournament  
− E for Section 1 4 Event Rules    
The following digit(s) represents the subsection in which the rule can be found. The final digits indicate the rule’s position within that subsection.  
Figure 1-3 Rule numbering method  
 
Warnings, cautions, and notes appear in blue boxes. Pay close attention 
to their contents as they’re intended to provide insight into the reasoning 
behind a rule, helpful information on understanding or interpreting a rule, 
and/or possible “best practices” for use when implementing systems 
affected by a rule.  
While blue boxes are part of the manual, they do not carry the weight of 
the actual rule (if there is an inadvertent conflict between a rule and its 
blue box, the rule supersedes the language in the blue box).  
Imperial dimensions are followed by comparable metric dimensions in parentheses to provide metric users with the approximate size, mass, etc. Metric conversions for non- rules (e.g. dimensions) round to 
the nearest whole unit, e.g. "17 in. (~43 cm)” and “6 ft. 4 in. (~193 cm).” Metric conversions in rules round such that the metric dimension is compliant with the rule (i.e. maximums round down, minimums round up). The metric conversions are offered for convenient reference only and do not overrule or take 

 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 11 of 164 the place of the imperial dimensions presented in this manual and the official drawings (i.e. dimensions 
and rules will always defer to measurements using imperial units).  
Rules include colloquial language, also called headlines, in an effort to convey an abbreviated version of the rule or rule set. There are two versions of headline formatting. Evergreen rules, or rules which are expected to go relatively unchanged from season to season, are indicated with a leading asterisk and their rule number and headline are presented in bold green text . “Relatively unchanged” means that the 
overall intent and presence of the rule from season to season is constant, but game specific ter ms may 
be updated as needed (e.g.  changing Power Cells to ALGAE in a rule about what COACHES may not 
contact during a MATCH ). These rules also start their respective section, so their rule number is not 
expected to change from season to season. All other rule headlines use bold blue text . Any 
disagreement between the specific language used in the rules and the colloquial language is an error, and the specific rule language is the ultimate authority. If you discover a disparity, please let us know at customerservice@firstinspires.org  and we will correct it.  
Team resources that aren’t generally season specific (e.g., what to expect at an event, communication resources, team organization recommendations, ROBOT  transportation procedures, and award 
descriptions) can be found on the FIRST Robotics Competition website . 
1.8 Translations & Other Versions  
The REEFSCAPE  manual is originally and officially written in English and is occasionally translated into 
other languages for the benefit of FIRST  Robotics Competition teams whose native language may not 
be English.  These assets are posted on the Translated Manuals page . 
A text- based English version is provided only for use with assistive devices on the Translated Manuals 
page . This document is locked for editing and has a watermark applied to indicate that it should not be 
copied . If you have any questions on the document , please contact the FIRST  Robotics Competition 
Team Advocate at frcteamadvocate@firstinspires.org . 
In the event that a rule or description is modified in an alternate version of this manual, the English pdf version as published on the REEFSCAPE - Season Materials web page  is the commanding version.  
1.9 Team Updates  
Team Updates are used to notify the FIRST Robotics Competition community of revisions to the official 
season documentation (e.g. the manual, drawings, etc.) or important season news. Team Update posts are scheduled as follows:  
− each Tuesday and Friday, starting on the first Tuesday after Kickoff and ending on the Tuesday prior to Week 1 events  
− each Tuesday, starting Week 1 and ending the week after the final District Championship 
events.  
Team Updates are posted on the REEFSCAPE - Season Materials web page  and are generally posted 
before 5 pm, Eastern.  
Generally, Team Updates follow the following convention:  
− Additions are highlighted in yellow. This is an example.  
− De letions are indicated with a strikethrough. This is an example.  
 
Section  1 Introduction  V1 12 of 164 1.10 Question and Answer System 
The Question and Answer System (Q&A)  is a resource for clarifying the 2025 REEFSCAPE Game 
Manual ,  Awards webpages , official FIELD drawings , and/or FIRST  Robot ics Competition District and 
Regional Events web page  content. Teams can search for previously asked questions and responses or 
pose new questions. Questions can include examples for clarity or reference multiple rules to 
understand the relationships and differences between them.  
The Q&A opens on January 8, 2025 , 12:00 PM Eastern. Details on the Q&A can be found on the 
REEFSCAPE - Season Materials web page . The Q&A may result in revisions to the text in the official 
manuals (which are communicated using the process described in Team Updates).  
The responses in the Q&A do not supersede the text in the manual, although every effort will be made to eliminate inconsistencies between the two. While responses provided in the Q&A may be used to aid 
discussion at each event, per section 9 Inspection & Eligibility  and section 6.7 Head REFEREE and FTA 
Interaction , REFEREES and INSPECTORS are the ultimate authority on rules. If you have concerns about 
enforcement trends by volunteer authorities, please notify FIRST at customerservice@firstinspires.org .   
The Q&A is not a resource for firm predictions on how a situation will play out an event. Questions 
about the following will not be addressed:  
− rulings on vague situations,  
− challenging decisions made at past events, or  
− design reviews of a ROBOT  system for legality.  
Weak questions are overly broad, vague, and/or include no rule references. Some examples of questions that will not be answered in the Q&A are:  
− Is this part/design legal?  
− How should the REFEREE have ruled when this specific game play happened?  
− Duplicate questions  
− Nonsense questions  
Good questions ask generically about features of parts or designs, gameplay scenarios, or rules, and often reference one or more relevant rules within the question. Some examples of questions that will 
likely be answered in the Q&A are:  
− A device we are considering using on the ROBOT  comes with purple AWG 40 wire, does this 
comply with R?? and R??  
− We’re not sure how to interpret how Rule G?? applies if blue ROBOT  A does X and red ROBOT  B 
does Y, can you please clarify?  
− If a ROBOT  does this specific action, is it doing what this defined term is describing?  
Questions from “FRC 99999” represent content asked by key volunteers (e.g., REFEREES, INSPECTORS, 
etc.), answered by FIRST, and are considered relevant to teams.

Section 4 Game Overview  V0 17 of 164 4 Game Overview  
 
In REEFSCAPESM presented by Haas , two competing alliances  are invited to score coral, harvest algae, and 
attach to the barge before time runs out. Alliances earn additional rewards for meeting specific scoring 
thresholds and for cooperating with their opponents.  
During the first 15 seconds of the match, robots are autonomous. Without guidance from their drivers, robots 
leave their starting zone, score coral on the reef, harvest algae from the reef, and collect and score additional coral.  
During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds, drivers control their robots. Robots collect coral from human players at their coral station and score them on the reef. To unlock all scoring locations on the reef, robots 
must dislodge algae from the reef an d either score it in the barge or deliver it to the human player through the 
processor.  
A human player can then deliver the algae to the barge. If at least two algae are scored in the processor by 
each alliance, both alliances earn a Coopertition  Point (which influences their rank in the tournament) and 
lowers the requirements for a ranking point.  
As time runs out, robots prepare to return to the surface with their algae  by grabbing onto their cages and 
parking under the barge.  
The alliance that earns the most points wins the match!  


 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 19 of 164 5 ARENA   
The ARENA  includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play REEFSCAPESM presented 
by Haas: the FIELD, SCORING ELEMENT S, queue area, team media area, designated TECHNICIAN area, and all 
equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT  control, and scorekeeping.  
Figure 5-1 REEFSCAPE  ARENA  (queue area, TECHNICIAN area, and media area not pictured)  
 
The ARENA  is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many times during the competition 
season. It undergo es wear and tear. The ARENA  is designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. 
Every effort is made to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to event. However, ARENAS are 
assembled in different venues by different event staff and some small variations occur. For de tails regarding 
assembly tolerances, please refer to the 2025  ARENA  Layout and Marking Diagram . Successful teams will 
design ROBOTS  that are insensitive to these variations.  
Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual understanding of the REEFSCAPE  ARENA , and 
dimensions included in the manual are nominal. Please refer to the official drawings for exact dimensions, 
tolerances, and construction details. The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low -cost versions of 
important elements of the REEFSCAPE FIELD are posted on the REEFSCAPE Playing FIELD web page  on the 
FIRST website.  
5.1 FIELD  
Each FIELD for REEFSCAPE  is an approximately 26 ft. 5  in. (~805  cm) by 5 7 ft. 6⅞ in. (~1 755 cm) carpeted 
area  bounded by  inward facing surfaces of the  ALLIANCE  WALLS, CORAL STATION S, PROCESSOR S and 
PROCESSOR openings , and guardrail s. 

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 20 of 164 Figure 5-2 FIELD boundary in pink  
 
The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements :  
− 1 REEF  per ALLIANCE ,  
− 1 PROCESSOR  per ALLIANCE ,  
− 2 CORAL STATION S per ALLIANCE , and  
− 1 BARGE which consists of 3 CAGES and 1 NET  for each  ALLIANCE . 
The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia Commercial, Neyland II 20, “66561 
Medallion .” Neyland II carpet is not available for purchase , and the closest equivalent is Shaw, Philadelphia 
Brand, Profusion 20, Style 54933 ; see results from FIRST’s evaluation in this blog post .  
Carpet edges and seams are secured with 3MTM Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape  GT2, GT3 or comparable 
Gaffer’s Tape. Tears, rips , and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of tape and ROBOTS 
must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet, tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs are made through the course of competition.  
Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 1 ft. 8 in. ( ~51 cm) tall system of transparent 
polycarbonate supported on the top and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail that 
allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS . The gate passthrough, when open, is 3 ft. 2 
in. (~97 cm) wide. Gates are closed and shielded during the MATCH .  

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 21 of 164 Figure 5-3 Gate locations  
 
There are 2 versions of guardrails and DRIVER STATIONS used for competitions. 1 design is reflected in the 
2025 Official FIRST  FIELD  Drawings & Models . The other is designed and sold by AndyMark. While the designs 
are slightly different, the critical dimensions, performance, and expected user experience between them are the same unless otherwise noted. Detailed drawings for the AndyMark design are poste d on the AndyMark 
website . All illustrations in this manual show the traditional FIELD design.  
5.2 Areas, Zones, & Markings  
FIELD areas, zones, and markings of consequence are described below. Unless otherwise specified, the tape used to mark lines and zones throughout the FIELD is 2  in. (~5 1 mm) 3M™ Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) 
Tape (GT2) , ProGaff® Premium Professional Grade Gaffer Tape , or comparable gaffers tape.

Figure 5-9 BARGE  
 
The BARGE  is a 29 ft. 2 in.  (889 cm) wide, 3 ft. 8 in.  (~112 cm) deep, and 8 ft. 5 in.  (~257 cm) tall structure that 
spans the center of the FIELD. It is made of truss structure  supported by legs just outside the guardrail. The 
BARGE includes  6 CAGES , a red and blue NET , and all structure supporting CAGES and  NET S. The horizontal 
truss structure is 5 ft. 2  in. (~157 cm) above the carpet and is supported in the center of the FIELD by vertical 
truss and supporting materials. The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5 ½ in., 7 ft. ⅜ 
in., 10 ft. 7⅜ in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field  to the center of the CAGE . 
The BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and 
completion of the Coopertition  Bonus  and the final 20 seconds in the match . One segment will light up each 
time an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE  all six segments will 
illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, 
the lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to help indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made.  

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 26 of 164 5.4.1  CAGE  
Figure 5-10 Shallow (left) and Deep (right) staged CAGES  
 
CAGES are 2  ft. tall and 7⅜ in. wide  (outside dimension ) (~61 cm tall and ~19 cm wide ) rectangular structures. 
Each CAGE is a welded structure made of 4 steel 1  in. Schedule  40 pipes, a bottom plate, a top plate , and an 
eyebolt with fastening hardware . CAGES are suspended from the truss structure in specific locations as shown

Section 5 ARENA  V4 28 of 164 5.5 PROCESSOR  
Figure 5-13: PROCESSOR  
 
A PROCESSOR  is a goal into which an ALLIANCE scores ALGAE . There is 1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE. The 
PROCESSOR is  integrated into the guardrail near  the ALLIANCE’ S REEF ZONE and adjacent to the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR  AREA.  Each PROCESSOR  has a rectangular opening  through which ROBOTS score ALGAE  which  
is 2 ft. 4 in. wide  (~71 cm ), 1 ft. 8 in. t all (~51 cm ), and 7 in. (~18 cm) from the carpet .  
Once a n ALGAE  passes through the PROCESSOR , it rolls past a scoring sensor array and into the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR  AREA. The HUMAN PLAYER must  keep the PROCESSOR clear for scoring, and  can shift scored 
ALGAE on top of the PROCESSOR where there are designated ALGAE holders.  

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 29 of 164 5.6 ALLIANCE WALL  
Figure 5-14: Red ALLIANCE WALL (highlighted in red)  
 
The ALLIANCE WALL separates ROBOTS from DRIVE TEAM members in the ALLIANCE AREA. It consists of 3 
DRIVER STATIONS.  
5.6.1  DRIVER STATIONS  
Figure 5-15 DRIVER STATION ( ALLIANCE  AREA perspective and FIELD perspective)  
 
A DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE  WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their 
ROBOT . Each DRIVER STATION is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 3 ft. 
6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER 

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 30 of 164 STATION to support an OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31 cm) 
deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook -and-loop tape (“loop” side) 
along the center of the support shelf that may be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf. The shelf also includes two  clips to hold the shelf in place with a 1 in. (~25 mm) b y 2 in. (~51 mm ) thick tab that 
sits on the top surface of the shelf.  
There may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited mobility. 
It is designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to access the DRIVER 
STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is 
available to anyone who has  a wheelchair or other physical disability that 
obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space constraints, the ramp is not 
allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. Teams should speak to the FTA 
before MATCHES begin to ensure that it is available for eac h of the team’s 
MATCHES.  
This ramp is available at many Regional and District events. For questions,  
please connect with the local Program Delivery Partner . 
Each DRIVER STATION contains the following elements for DRIVE TEAMS:  
− 1 Ethernet cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR CONSOLE and provides connectivity to the FIELD  Management System (FMS)  
− 1 120VAC NEMA 5 -15R power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet): located on each DRIVER STATION shelf 
and protected by its own 2 -Amp circuit breaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR CONSOLE. 
DRIVE TEAMS are responsible for monitoring their power consumptio n as a tripped breaker in the 
outlet does not constitute an ARENA FAULT . For some events in regions that don’t use NEMA 5 -15 
shaped outlets, event organizers may install appropriate plug adapters to be used throughout the event.  
− 1 Emergency Stop (E -Stop) button: located on the left side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to 
deactivate a ROBOT  in an emergency  
− 1 Autonomous Sto p (A-Stop) button:  located on the right side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used 
to DISABLE a ROBOT  during AUTO  
− 1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD facing side of the sign displays the 
team number in the ALLIANCE color. The ALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays  the following 
information in red:   
o Pre-MATCH : team number and ROBOT connection state  
o During the MATCH :  
 remaining MATCH  period  time ,  
 MATCH scores, and 
 progress toward s the CORAL  RP threshold (n/a during the Playoff Tournament ). 
Figure 5-16 Back of team sign  
 

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 31 of 164 − 1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time remaining in the MATCH period on the 
FIELD -facing side (in white) and  a more detailed breakdown of CORAL scored on each level of the REEF  
on the TEAM -facing side. (in red) . 
Figure 5-17 Back of t imer  
 
− 1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE  color, ROBOT  status, E -Stop and A -Stop status, and is centered 
at the top of each DRIVER STATION.  
The stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE -colored ROBOT  status LEDs above a third amber A- stop/ E-
stop LED. LED states are as follows:  
o ROBOT  status LEDs  
 Solid: indicates that the ROBOT  is connected and enabled. This only happens during a 
MATCH . 
 Blinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH  and the ROBOT  is not 
connected yet, or it’s during a MATCH  and the corresponding ROBOT  is BYPASSED , has 
lost connectivity, or the E -stop was pressed.  
 Off: indicates that the ROBOT  is linked and DISABLED prior to the start of the MATCH . 
This light is also off, regardless of ROBOT  connection status, after the MATCH  has 
concluded.  
o A-Stop/ E-stop LED   
 Solid: the ROBOT  is DISABLED due to a press of the team E -stop button, the FIELD E -stop 
button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.  
 Blinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to a press of the team 
A-Stop button.  
 Off: the ROBOT  is not DISABLED by the FIELD.  
− FMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves  in the 2 DRIVER STATIONS closer to the 
scoring table . 

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 32 of 164 5.6.2  CORAL STATION  
Figure 5-18 CORAL STATION  
 
A CORAL STATION  is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 
CORAL STATIONS , 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the  guardrail to the  ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL 
STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall ( ~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall ) opening through which CORAL 
passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm ) from the carpet. A 5 5° sloped tunnel, 
called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION .  
There are 2  stool s available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use.  Each stool is 1 ft. 
11 in.  (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. ( ~34 cm ) deep, 6 ¼ in.  (~16 cm) tall , and rated 
for 300 lbs. ( ~136 kg ). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals  who are shorter , better sightlines  onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another 
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD . Due to space 
constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA.  
Only 2 stools are available , and priority will be given to  those with the biggest 
need. Teams should speak to the FTA  before MATCHES begin to request  that it 
is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their 
own  (Item Number: 779ac01stpm ) o r bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and 
similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use  for every match .  
This stool  is available at all events  within the US & Canada and equivalents are 
available at international events . For questions, please connect with the local 
Program Delivery Partner . 
5.7 SCORING ELEMENT S 
SCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score additional points. There are 2 types of SCORING 
ELEMENTS  used in REEFSCAPE: CORAL and ALGAE.  

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 33 of 164 5.7.1  CORAL  
Figure 5-19 CORAL  
 
A CORAL  is a 11 ⅞ in. long (~30 cm ) piece of 4 in. diameter Sch edule 40 Cellular ( Foam ) Core PVC pipe. 
CORAL  has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4½ -in. (~11 cm) outsi de diameter. CORAL is  available for 
purchase from AndyMark, am- 5601 or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter  Schedule 40 Cellular 
(Foam) Core PVC pipe .  
Prior to K ickoff, CORAL was  known as “Game Piece 1” and not available for pre -
order prior to the season.  
CORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight  of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5 -0.8 kg) and has text marking along 
the length of the pipe that may vary in color .  
Teams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may 
have variances in color, markings, and weight.   
CORAL  undergo es wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL  that still appears to look 
approximately like a CORAL  is considered a CORAL  for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether 
damaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL  are not considered a CORAL . 
The edge of the CORAL  may be rough or sharp . Teams should use caution when 
handling CORAL . 

 
Section 5 ARENA  V4 34 of 164 5.7.2  ALGAE  
Figure 5-20: ALGAE  
 
Each ALGAE  is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) ± ¼ in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is  custom  
made for FIRST by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark am -5602. 
Prior to K ickoff, ALGAE was known as “Game Piece 2” and  was available for pre -
order prior to the season.  
At events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 
mm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will be inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It will be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, which is 16.25  in. (~413 mm) diameter.  
The tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured  allow for variances in 
diameter, wall thickness,  weight distribution and overall weight . They  may  not 
always be uniformly spherical,  roll straight , or bounce as expected.

5.9 The FIELD  Management System 
The FIELD Management System (FMS) is all the electronics responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST  
Robotics Competition FIELD. The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including computers, REFEREE 
touchscreens,  the wireless access point, sensors, stack lights, A- Stops and E- Stops, etc.  
When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their assigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR 
CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once 
connected, the open ports available are described in Table 8 -5. 
Note that ROBOT  code cannot be deployed while connected to the FMS. Additional information about the FMS 
may be found in the FMS Whitepaper . 
The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH  using audio cues detailed in  Table 5 -1. Please note 
that audio cues are intended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH  markers. If 
there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers, the FIELD timers are the authority.

5.10 FIELD STAFF  
FIELD STAFF  are responsible for making sure the MATCHES are cycled through efficiently, fairly,  safely, and 
with a spirit of cooperation, Gracious  Professionalism, and generosity of spirit. FIELD STAFF  roles are filled by 
volunteers from the community who prepare for the event with thorough training and certification. There are 3 
FIELD -side key volunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and  are encouraged to  use as resources to 
make their event experience valuable (in whatever way the team defines “ valuable”). 
− Head REFEREE – trains , direct s, and supervis es REFEREES . They oversee all scoring processes and 
procedures in collaboration with the FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS , 
volunteers, and contracted/ FIRST staff. The Head REFEREE is positioned between the FIELD and the 
scoring table and wears a yellow shirt. The Head REFEREE  has final authority for decisions regarding  
MATCH  scores, penalties,  and YELLOW and RED CARD assignments . For additional details, please refer 
to the Head REFEREE role description .  
− FIRST Technical Advisor  (FTA) - ensures  events run smoothly, safely, and in accordance with FIRST  
requirements. The FTA collaborates with FIRST staff, event staff, and other event volunteers in many 
different areas at events. The FTA is the liaison between FIRST HQ and the event for all things related 
to the FIELD , ROBOTS,  and game, acts as a team advocate for all teams competing at the event and is a 
major point of escalation and conflict resolution for the event.  For additional details, please refer to th e 
FTA role description . 
− FIELD Supervisor  - direct s activity on the FIELD  to ensure efficient execution of the MATCHES , pacing 
of the event, and smooth flow of MATCH  play. FIELD  Supervisors  are responsible for ensuring the 
FIELD is intact  and lead  FIELD R eset  team s, who are  responsible for resetting the FIELD  after each 
MATCH in preparation for the subsequent MATCH . For additional details, please refer to the FIELD 
Supervisor role description . 
 

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 41 of 164 6 Game Details  
Figure 6-1 REEFSCAPE  
 
In REEFSCAPE, 2 ALLIANCES (an ALLIANCE is a cooperative of up to 4 FIRST R obot ics Competition teams)  
play MATCHES , set up and implemented per the details described below .  
6.1 MATCH Overview 
MATCHES  run on 7 –10-minute cycles, which consist  of pre -MATCH  setup, the 2 -minute and 30 -second 
MATCH , and the post -MATCH  reset.  
During the MATCH, ROBOTS collect CORAL  and score on their REEF. ROBOTS also collect ALGAE and s core in 
their PROCESSOR  or NET . HUMAN PLAYERS can score  ALGAE  in their NET  once it has been passed to them 
via the ir opponent’s PROCESSOR .  
ROBOTS  conclude the MATCH PARKING in their BARGE ZON E or suspending from a CAGE . 
6.2 DRIVE TEAM  
A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST  Robotics Competition team responsible for 
team performance for a specific MATCH . There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES  can 
use to assist ROBOTS  with REEFSCAPE, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-
STUDENT .  
The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, 
barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who 
arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s 
and ROBOT ’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated 

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 42 of 164 with more than 1 team). The intent is not to allow teams to “adopt” members of 
other teams for strategic advantage for the loaning team, borrowing team, 
and/or their ALLIANCE  (e.g. an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  believes 1 of their DRIVERS 
has more experience than a DRIVER on their first pick, and the teams agree the 
first pick team will “adopt” that DRIVER and make them a member of their DRIVE 
TEAM for Playoffs).  
The definition isn’t stricter for 2 main reasons. First, to avoid additional 
bureaucratic burden on teams and event volunteers (e.g. requiring that teams 
submit official rosters that Queuing must check before allowing a DRIVE TEAM 
into the ARENA ). Second, to provide space for exceptional circumstances that 
give teams the opportunity to display Gracious Professionalism  (e.g. a bus is 
delayed, a COACH has no DRIVERS, and their pit neighbors agree to help by 
loaning DRIVERS as temporary members of the team until their bus arrives).  
Table 6-1 DRIVE TEAM roles  
Role  Description  Max./  
DRIVE TEAM  Criteria  
COACH  a guide or advisor  1 any team member, must wear “COACH” 
button  
TECHNICIAN  a resource for ROBOT  
troubleshooting, setup, and removal from the FIELD  1 any team member, must wear “TECHNICIAN” button  
DRIVER  an operator and controller of the ROBOT   
3 STUDENT, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM” button  
HUMAN PLAYER  a SCORING ELEMENT  
manager  
A STUDENT is a person who has not completed high -school, secondary school, or the comparable level as of 
September 1 prior to Kickoff.  
The TECHNICIAN provides teams with a technical resource for pre -MATCH setup, ROBOT connectivity, 
OPERATOR CONSOLE troubleshooting, and post -MATCH removal of the ROBOT. Some pre -MATCH 
responsibilities for the TECHNICIAN may include, but are not limited to:  
− location of the ROBOT radio, its power connection, and understanding of its indicator lights 
− location of the roboRIO and understanding of its indicator lights  
− username and password for the OPERATOR CONSOLE  
− restarting the Driver Station and Dashboard software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE  
− changing the bandwidth utilization (e.g. camera resolution, frame rate, etc.)  
− changing a battery  
− charging pneumatics  
While the TECHNICIAN may be the primary technical member of the DRIVE 
TEAM, all members of the DRIVE TEAM are encouraged to have knowledge of the 
basic functionality of the ROBOT , such as the location and operation of the main 
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 43 of 164 circuit breaker, connecting and resetting joysticks or gamepads from the 
OPERATOR CONSOLE, and removing the ROBOT  from the FIELD.  
Per Table 6 -1, each team is allotted up to 3 STUDENTS who may be assigned as DRIVERS or HUMAN 
PLAYERS. If multiple teams on an ALLIANCE do not have 3 STUDENTS at the event to act in these roles , 1 of 
the ALLIANCE’S teams may substitute a STUDENT TECHNICIAN as a HUMAN PLAYER for that MATCH only. In 
this case,  
− the Head REFEREE must be notified,  
− all HUMAN PLAYER rules now apply to this DRIVE TEAM member, and  
− this DRIVE TEAM member is no longer considered a TECHNICIAN for that MATCH.  
6.3 Setup  
Before each MATCH begins, FIELD STAFF  stage SCORING ELEMENT S as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING 
ELEMENTS . DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOTS (as described in section 6.3.3  ROBOTS ) and OPERATOR 
CONSOLES (as described in section 6.3.2  OPERATOR CONSOLES ). Then, DRIVE TEAMS take their places as 
described in  section  6.3.1  DRIVE TEAMS . 
6.3.1  DRIVE TEAMS  
DRIVE TEAMS prepare  for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE 
TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a  
DRIVE TEAM obstructing  or delaying any of the conditions is a t risk of violating  G301 .  
A. only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming  MATCH are present , 
B. For QUALIFICATION and PLAYOFF MATCHES only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have 
passed initial, complete Inspection are present,  
C. 1 HUMAN PLAYER must be  staged in  their PROCESSOR  AREA,  
D. any number of HUMAN PLAYERS  are staged in their CORAL STATION AREA S, 
E. HUMAN PLAYERS not included  in C or D , DRIVERS , and COACHES  are in their ALLIANCE AREA and  
behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE,  
F. TECHNICIANS are in the event -designated area near the FIELD,  
G. DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above the ir waist s (COACH - 
“Coach”, DRIVERS and  HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”, and TECHNICIAN - “Technician”) , and 
H. if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly display s their designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN 
identifier (e.g. hat or armband).  
6.3.2  OPERATOR CONSOLES  
DRIVE TEAMS set up their OPERATOR CONSOLE  as soon as the  DRIVE TEAM from the previous MATCH has 
cleared the area. OPERATOR CONSOLES must be compliant with all relevant rules, specifically those in section  
8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE . The OPERATOR CONSOLE is  plugged into the team’s  assigned DRIVER STATION, as 
indicated on the team sign . Any c ontrol devices worn or held by their HUMAN PLAYERS and/or DRIVERS during 
the MATCH must be disconnected from or set on or beside the OPERATOR CONSOLE before the MATCH can 
begin. A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying OPERATOR CONSOLE setup  is at risk of violating  G301 . 
For the purposes of FIRST Robotics Competition, any device connected to the 
OPERATOR CONSOLE is considered a control device because REFEREES are not 
expected to differentiate between devices that can or cannot control the ROBOT . 
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 44 of 164 6.3.3  ROBOTS  
DRIVE TEAMS stage their ROBOT in accordance with G303 . A DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying ROBOT 
setup requirements is at risk of violating G301 .  
If order of placement matters to either or both ALLIANCES, the ALLIANCE notifies  the Head REFEREE during 
setup for that MATCH, and the Head REFEREE instructs  ALLIANCES to alternate placement of ROBOTS. In a 
Qualification MATCH, REFEREE instructions are that ROBOTS are placed in the following order:  
1. red DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT  
2. blue DRIVER STATION 1 ROBOT  
3. red DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT  
4. blue DRIVER STATION 2 ROBOT  
5. red DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT  
6. blue DRIVER STATION 3 ROBOT  
In an int ra-Division  Playoff MATCH, the same pattern is applied, but instead of blue ALLIANCE placing last, the 
higher seeded ALLIANCE (regardless of color) places last.  For inter-Division  Playoff MATCHES , the ALLIANCE 
that places last is determined by a (real or virtual) coin flip  facilitated by the Head REFEREE where a “heads”  
result invites the red ALLIANCE to place last .  
FIELD STAFF may ask teams to indicate  their intended location  and are not 
required  to wait for a team to stage  their ROBOT in its  exact location before 
moving to the next team.  
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 45 of 164 6.3.4  SCORING ELEMENT S 
Before each MATCH  begins, FIELD STAFF stage SCORING ELEMENT S.  
Figure 6-2 CORAL MARK  locations  and SCORING ELEMENT  staging positions  
 
6.3.4.1  CORAL  
126 CORAL  are staged for each MATCH as follows (reference Figure 6 -2):  
A. 1 CORAL  is staged on each CORAL  MARK  (6 total , CORAL are staged such that each CORAL covers the 
opposite ends of each CORAL MARK ), 
B. 1 CORAL may be preloaded  in each ROBOT  by the ROBOT ’S DRIVE TEAM , such that the CORAL  is fully 
supported by the ROBOT  (up to 6 total, a  CORAL  not pre -loaded in a ROBOT is staged with CORAL  in the 
corresponding ALLIANCE AREA), and   
C. remaining  CORAL are split evenly  behind each CORAL STATION  (57 to 60  per ALLIANCE , depending on 
how many are preloaded in ROBOTS).  
6.3.4.2  ALGAE  
18 ALGAE  are staged for each MATCH  as follows  (reference Figure 6 -2):  
A. 6 ALGAE  are staged on  pairs of  BRANCHES  as shown in Figure 6 -3 (12 total)  such that they are 
placed lightly onto the REEF , and 
B. 1 ALGAE  is placed on top of each CORAL staged on a CORAL MARK (6 total).  
Staged ALGAE will not contact CORAL placed on L4.  

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 46 of 164 Figure 6-3 Staging positions for ALGAE  on a REEF  
 
6.3.5  CAGES  
Each  team can choose the height of the CAGE closest to their driver station.  By default, all CAGES are left in 
the s tate from the last match.  At the start of each day, all CAGES are set as  deep CAGES . If a team would like 
to alter the CAGE height they m ust alert the FIELD STAFF during reset.  Each team informs FIELD STAFF of their 
preference for their corresponding CAGE height.  
Figure 6-4 CAGE positions corresponding to DRIVER STATIONS  
 
6.4 MATCH Phases  
The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called the Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, 
ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE TEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to leave their ROBOT STARTING 

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 47 of 164 LINE, score SCORING ELEMENT S, and retrieve SCORING ELEMENT S. There is a 3- second delay between AUTO 
and TELEOP for scoring purposes as described in s ection 6.5 Scoring . 
The second phase of each MATCH  is the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds (2:15) and called the 
Teleoperated Period (TELEOP).  During TELEOP , DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS  to retrieve and score 
SCORING ELEMENT S and climb their CAGES. 
6.5 Scoring   
ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions through out a MATCH , including LEAVING  their 
ROBOT STARTING LINE , scoring CORAL on their REEF, scoring ALGAE  in their PROCESSOR  and NET , climbing 
CAGES, and winning or tying MATCHES . 
Rewards are granted either via MATCH  points , Coopertition  points,  or Ranking  Points ( often  abbreviated to RP, 
which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  
All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH , except as follows:  
A. assessment of CORAL  scored on the REEF  and ALGAE  scored in the PROCESSOR  or NET  continues for 
up to 3 seconds after  the ARENA  timer displays 0 :00 following AUTO . 
B. assessment of CORAL  scored on the REEF and ALGAE  scored in the PROCESSOR  or NET  contin ues for 
up to 3 seconds after  the ARENA  timer displays 0 :00 following TELEOP.  
C. assessment of CAGE  points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA  timer displays 0 :00 following TELEOP , 
or when all ROBOTS  have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH , whichever happens 
first.  
LEAVING the ROBOT STARTING LINE, CORAL  scoring , ALGAE scoring  in the NET , 
PARKING and CAGE  points are all evaluated and scored by human volunteers . 
Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the 
criteria are met.  
6.5.1  SCORING ELEMENT  Scoring Criteria  
A CORAL  is scored  in the trough ( L1) of the  REEF if it is not in contact with a ROBOT  on that ALLIANCE , not 
scored on any other level of the REEF, and  
A. contacting the trough , or 
B. directly supported (either fully or partially ) by a CORAL in contact with the trough .  
 
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 48 of 164 Figure 6-5 Examples of CORAL scored in the trough (L1)  
 
Figure 6 -5 includes examples of CORAL on the REEF at the conclusion of a 
MATCH.  
A. CORAL  A, C, F, and H  are scored because they meet criteria A. 
B. CORAL B  and G are scored because they meet criteria B . 
C. CORAL D and E do not meet any criteria for trough scoring.  
 
A CORAL is scored  on L2-L4 BRANCH  if the BRANCH  is inside the volume of the CORAL and the CORAL  is not 
in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE or an ALGAE. Only 1 CORAL can be scored per BRANCH.  
An ALGAE  is scored in a PROCESSOR  once it has passed through the opening of the PROCESSOR  and by the 
sensor array.  An ALGAE  is scored in a NET  if it is above the NET and within the perimeter of the NET , 
contacting the NET or ALGAE contacting the NET, and not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE. 
If a CORAL scored in AUTO gets removed from a BRANCH during TELEOP, the AUTO points are removed  but 
the CORAL will still count towards the AUTO RP . If a CORAL is scored in that location again, the AUTO points 
associated with the original scored CORAL is restored.  CORAL scored in the trough is not tracked by specific 
location, if a CORAL is removed from the trough after AUTO, the points removed will correspond to the lowest scoring CORAL (i.e. TELEOP CORAL removed first) ; if CORAL is re -scored in the trough,  points will be re -added 
in the reverse order (i.e. AUTO CORAL re -added first).  
6.5.2  ROBOT  Scoring Criteria  
To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT  must move such that its BUMPERS no longer overlap its  ROBOT 
STARTING LINE  at the end of AUTO.  
To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT ’S BUMPERS  must  be partially or  completely contained in the ir BARGE 
ZONE at the end of the MATCH  and does not meet the criteria for CAGE points . 

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 49 of 164 To qualify for CAGE  points, a ROBOT  must be contacting one and only one  of their ALLIANCE’S CAGE S (and 
not touching any ANCHOR ), not contacting the carpet,  and may additionally contact only the following 
elements : 
A. SCORING ELEMENT S, 
B. another ROBOT  qualified for CAGE  points,  
C. a partner  ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of  G428 , and 
D. an opponent ROBOT . 
6.5.3  Coopertition  Bonus  
In Qualification MATCHES, if at least 2 ALGAE are scored in each ALLIANCE’S PROCESSOR , all teams earn 1  
Coopertition  Point , and the threshold for the CORAL RP  decreases as described in  Table 6 -2. 
See section 10.5.3  Qualification Ranking  for more informatio n about Coopertition  influence on Qualification 
Ranking order.

6.6 Violations  
Unless  otherwise noted, all violations are assigned for each instance of a rule violation. A description of the 
penalties are listed in Table 6 -3. All rules throughout the Game Rules section are called as perceived by a 
REFEREE.  
Table 6-3 Rule violations

VERBAL WARNING  a warning issued by event staff or the Head REFEREE.  
ALLIANCE is ineligible for RP An ALLIANCE is ineligible for the specified RP for that MATCH. This overrides any RP awarded through normal MATCH play or other rule 
violations.  
6.6.1  YELLOW and RED CARDS  
In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this document , YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are 
used in FIRST Robotics Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align with the mission, 
values, and culture of FIRST. 
The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD for egregious behavior 
inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics Competition event.  
A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air 
while the Game Announcer describes the violation.  
YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is automatically converted to a RED CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the completion of the MATCH. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW CARD into subse quent MATCHES, except as noted below.  
Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a  yellow rectangle  will show  next to the team number  on the 
audience display  during  subsequent MATCHES , including any replays . 
Figure 6-6 Example audience screen graphic showing YELLOW CARD indicators  
 

 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 52 of 164 All YELLOW CARDS are cleared in FMS at the conclusion of Practice, Qualification, and division Playoff 
MATCHES. VERBAL WARNINGS  issued by the head REFEREE are cleared after Practice MATCHES and persist 
from Qualification MATCHES through subsequent tournament phases.  
6.6.2  YELLOW and RED CARD application  
YELLOW and RED CARDS are applied based on the following:  
Table 6-4 YELLOW and RED CARD application  
Time YELLOW or RED CARDS earned:  MATCH to which CARD is applied:  
Prior to Qualification MATCHES  REFEREES may or may not be present during Practice MATCH ES. With input from event staff, The Head 
REFEREE may opt to perpetuate a VERBAL WARNING or 
YELLOW CARD earned prior to Qualification  MATCHES to 
the first Qualification MATCH for particularly egregious behavior.  
during the Qualification MATCHES  team’s current (or just -completed) MATCH . In the case 
where the team participated as a SURROGATE  in the 
current (or just completed) MATCH , the card is applied to 
the team’s previous MATCH  (i.e. the team’s second  
Qualification MATCH ) 
between the end of Qualification MATCHES and the start of Playoff MATCHES  ALLIANCE’S first Playoff MATCH  
during the Playoff MATCHES  ALLIANCE’S current (or just -completed) MATCH   
Please see examples of the ap plication of YELLOW and RED CARDS as shown in 
section 6.6.4  Violation Details . 
6.6.3  YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES  
During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the violating team’s entire ALLIANCE instead of to only the violating team. If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES receive a RED CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH.  
6.6.4  Violation Details  
There are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below are some example violations and a clarification of the way the violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible violations, but rather a representative se t of combinations.  
Table 6-5 Violation examples  
Example Violation  Expanded Interpretation  
MINOR FOUL  Upon violation, a MINOR FOUL  is assessed against the 
violating ALLIANCE . 
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 53 of 164 Example Violation  Expanded Interpretation  
MAJOR FOUL  and YELLOW CARD  Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL  is assessed against the 
violating ALLIANCE . After the MATCH , the Head 
REFEREE presents the violating team with a YELLOW 
CARD. 
MINOR FOUL  per additional SCORING 
ELEMENT . If egregious, YELLOW CARD  Upon violation, a number of MINOR FOUL S are assessed 
against the violating ALLIANCE equal to the number of 
additional SCORING ELEMENTS  beyond the permitted 
quantity. Additionally, if the REFEREES determine that 
the action was egregious, the Head REFEREE presents 
the violating team with a YELLOW CARD  after the 
MATCH .  
MINOR FOUL . MAJOR FOUL  IF 
REPEATED  Upon initial violation in a MATCH, a MINOR FOUL  is 
assessed against the violating ALLIANCE. If the 
ALLIANCE ROBOT repeats the infraction in the MATCH, a MAJOR FOUL  is assessed against the violating 
ALLIANCE. Assuming no additional infractions of that rule by that ROBOT in that MATCH, the ROBOT has “earned” a MINOR FOUL  and a MAJOR FOUL  for their 
ALLIANCE. 
MAJOR FOUL , and for every 3 seconds in 
which the situation is not corrected , a 
MAJOR FOUL  is assessed  Upon violation, a MAJOR FOUL  is assessed against the 
violating ALLIANCE  and the REFEREE begins to count. 
Their count continues until the criteria to discontinue the count are met, and for each 3 seconds within that time, 
an additional MAJOR FOUL  is assessed against the 
violating ALLIANCE . A ROBOT  in violation of this type of 
rule for 15 seconds receives a total of 6 MAJOR FOUL S 
(assuming no other rules were being simultaneously violated).  
RED CARD  for the ALLIANCE  After the MATCH , the Head REFEREE presents the 
violating ALLIANCE  with a RED CARD  in the following 
fashion: 
• In a PLAYOFF MATCH , a single RED CARD  is 
assessed to the ALLIANCE. 
• In all other scenarios, each team on the ALLIANCE is issued a RED CARD . 
6.7 Head REFEREE and FTA Interaction  
The Head REFEREE has the ultimate authority in the ARENA during the event, but may receive input from additional sources, e.g. Game Designers, FIRST personnel, FTA, and other event staff. The Head REFEREE 
rulings are final. No event staff, including the Head REFEREE, will review video, photos, artistic renderings, etc. of any MATCH, from any source, under any circumstances.  
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 54 of 164 6.7.1  Question Box  (Q) 
Each ALLIANCE has a designated Question Box near the scoring table. If a DRIVE TEAM has a question about 
a MATCH, the FIELD, etc., they may send 1 DRIVE TEAM member to their corresponding Question Box. 
Depending on timing, the Head REFEREE  or FTA may postpone any requested discussion until the end of the 
subsequent MATCH.  
Technical questions regarding FIELD or ROBOT operation are addressed by the FTA, and additional team members are invited to participate in these conversations if necessary. If a DRIVE TEAM needs clarification on a ruling or score, per Q101 , 1 STUDENT from that DRIVE TEAM should address the Head REFEREE after the 
ARENA Reset Signal (e.g. FIELD lights turn green).  
While FMS tracks quantities of MINOR  and MAJOR  FOUL S, FIRST instructs REFEREES to not self -track details 
about MINOR FOUL S and MAJOR FOUL S; as a result, REFEREES are not expected to recall details about what 
MINOR FOUL S and MAJOR  FOUL S were made, when they occurred, and against whom.  
Any reasonable question is fair game in the Question Box, and Head REFEREES 
will make good faith efforts to provide helpful feedback (e.g. how/why certain 
MINOR FOUL S are being called, why a particular ROBOT may be susceptible to 
certain MINOR FOUL S based on its design or game play, how specific rules are 
being called or interpreted), but please know that they may not be able to supply 
specific details.  
Q101  *1 STUDENT, 1 Head REFEREE . A team may only address the Head REFEREE with 1 STUDENT. The 
STUDENT may not be accompanied by more than 1 silent observer .  
Violation: The Head REFEREE will not address additional, non- compliant team members or peripheral 
conversations.  
Some events may restrict ARENA access to members of the DRIVE TEAM.  Team 
members are permitted  to swap buttons within their team as needed to access 
the Question Box. 
Laws regarding recording of conversations vary state -to-state and country -to 
country, and, in some cases, recording without consent may be criminal. 
Introducing the idea of recording a  conversation with an implied reason of 
proving someone’s error can escalate a discussion and is likely to increase its 
adversarial nature. Sometimes it’s appropriate; often it’s neither appropriate nor 
constructive.  
Please do not record FIRST event staff, or anyone at an event, without the 
person’s consent and please do not challenge the decision to decline consent to 
be recorded.  FIRST  event staff are empowered to excuse themselves from  an 
interaction in which they are being recorded after declining consent . 
6.8 Other Logistics 
SCORING ELEMENT S that leave the FIELD, other than via the PROCESSOR , are placed back into the FIELD 
approximately at the point of exit by FIELD STAFF (REFEREES, FTAs, or other staff working around the FIELD) at the earliest safe opportunity. ALGAE that leaves the PROCESSOR AREA may be returned to the PROCESSOR 
AREA or the FIELD.    
Note that, except for ALGAE  via the PROCESSOR , ROBOTS may not deliberately 
cause SCORING ELEMENT S to leave the FIELD (see G407 ). 
 
Section 6 Game Details  V13 55 of 164 An ARENA FAULT  (an error in ARENA operation  described in s ection 10.2  MATCH Replays ) is not called for 
MATCHES that accidentally begin with damaged SCORING ELEMENTS . Damaged SCORING ELEMENTS are not 
replaced until the next ARENA reset period. DRIVE TEAMS should alert the FIELD STAFF to any missing or 
damaged SCORING ELEMENT S prior to the start of the MATCH.  
Once the MATCH  is over and the Head REFEREE determines that the FIELD is safe for FIELD STAFF and DRIVE 
TEAMS, they or their designee change the FIELD  lights to green and DRIVE TEAMS may retrieve their ROBOT . 
Some MATCHES may include a short period afterward for the REFEREES and official scorers to confirm 
SCORING ELEMENT counts prior to finalizing the score. This period is indicated with purple lights on the team 
signs and the word “count” displayed. TEAMS are  not allowed on the field during this time.  
During ARENA  reset, the ARENA  is cleared of ROBOTS  and OPERATOR CONSOLES from the MATCH  that just 
ended, ROBOTS  and OPERATOR CONSOLES for the subsequent MATCH  are loaded into the ARENA  by DRIVE 
TEAMS, and FIELD STAFF reset ARENA  elements.  
FIRST Robotics Competition uses 3 words in the context of how durations and actions are assessed with 
regards to evaluation of rules and assignment of violations. These words provide general guidance to describe 
benchmarks to be used across the program. It is n ot the intent for REFEREES to provide a count during the 
time periods.  
− MOMENTARY describes durations that are fewer than approximately 3 seconds.  
− CONTINUOUS describes durations that are more than approximately 10 seconds.  
− REPEATED describes actions  that happen more than once within a MATCH .  


 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 57 of 164 7 Game Rules  (G) 
7.1 Personal Safety  
G101  *Humans, stay off the FIELD until green.  A team member may only enter the FIELD if FIELD lighting  
(FIELD facing side of the team signs  and timers ) is green, unless explicitly instructed by a REFEREE or 
an FTA.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. 
For example, a member of Team 9999 enters the FIELD prior to lights going 
green after MATCH  3, and a different member enters the FIELD prior to lights 
going green after MATCH  25. The team receives a VERBAL WARNING  for the first 
violation and a YELLOW CARD for the second.  
G102  *Never step over the guardrail. A team member may only enter or exit the FIELD through open gates.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
Teams are encouraged to ensure that all members of their DRIVE TEAM are 
aware of this rule. It’s easy to violate, particularly when teams are doing their 
best to move on and off the FIELD quickly. The violations of this rule are intended 
to avoid nuisance penalties, but still enforce safety requirements around the 
FIELD. There is the potential for injury when stepping over the guardrail.  
Violations of this rule apply to the entire team, not specifically to any 1 individual. 
For example, a member of Team 9999 steps over the guardrail prior to MATCH  3, 
and a different member steps over the guardrail prior to MATCH  25. The team 
receives a VERBAL WARNING for the first violation and a YELLOW CARD for the 
second.  
G103  *Be careful what you interact with.  A team member is  prohibited from the following actions with 
regards to interaction with ARENA  elements.  
A. climbing on or inside,  
B. hanging from,  
C. manipulating such that it doesn’t return to its original shape without human intervention, and  
D. damaging.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
G104  *Teams may not enable their ROBOTS  on the FIELD.  Teams may not tether to the ROBOT  while on the 
FIELD except in special circumstances (e.g. after Opening Ceremonies, before an immediate MATCH  
replay, etc.) and with the express permission from the FTA or a REFEREE.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
Teams are encouraged to consider this rule when developing their ROBOTS . 
FMS will not enable ROBOTS  after the conclusion of the MATCH . 
For the purposes of this rule, tethering includes any wired or wireless connection 
used to electrically energize and/or control elements on the ROBOT . The safety 
of teams and volunteers in close proximity to ROBOTS  and ARENA  elements on 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 58 of 164 the FIELD is of the utmost importance, therefore ROBOTS  or ROBOT  
COMPONENTS may not be enabled in any way on the FIELD before or after  the 
MATCH . 
ROBOTS need to be safely transported off the FIELD and back to the pits after 
the MATCH, and there may be bystanders, doorways, or height restrictions along 
the route.  
7.2 Conduct  
G201  *Be a good person. All teams must be civil toward everyone  and respectful of team and event 
equipment while at a FIRST Robotics Competition event.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.  
Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to , the use of 
offensive language or other uncivil conduct.  
Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that is likely to result in ARENA  
ejection include, but are not limited to, the following:  
A. assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if 
unintended),  
B. threat, e.g. saying something like “if you don’t reverse that call, I’ll make you 
regret it,”  
C. harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a 
decision’s been made or a question’s been answered,  
D. bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person to feel 
inadequate,  
E. insulting, e.g. telling someone they don’t deserve to be on a DRIVE TEAM,  
F. swearing at another person (versus swearing under one’s breath or at 
oneself), and  
G. yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration.  
G202  *Don’t bang on the glass.  A team member may never strike or hit the DRIVER STATION plastic 
windows.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
G203  *Asking other teams to throw a MATCH  – not cool.  A team may not encourage an ALLIANCE of which 
it is not a member to play beneath its ability.  
Note: This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE  from planning and/or executing its own strategy 
in a specific MATCH  in which all the teams are members of the ALLIANCE. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . RED  CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
Example 1: A MATCH  is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team C is 
encouraged by Team D to not get on a CAGE  at the end of the MATCH , resulting 
in Teams A, B, and C not earning a Ranking Point. Team D’s motivation for this 
behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the Tournament rankings and 
negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team D has violated this rule.  
Example 2: A MATCH  is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is 
assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team D encourages Team A to not 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 59 of 164 participate in the MATCH  so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B 
and C. Team D has violated this rule.  
Example 3: Asking a team to “no show” for a MATCH.  
FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a 
MATCH , to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST  values 
and not a strategy any team should employ.  
G204  *Letting someone coerce you into throwing a MATCH  – also not cool.  A team, as the result of 
encouragement by a team not on their ALLIANCE , may not play beneath its ability.  
Note : This rule is not intended to prevent an ALLIANCE  from planning and/or executing its own strategy 
in a specific MATCH  in which all the ALLIANCE  members are participants.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . RED  CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
Example 1:  A MATCH is being played by Teams A, B, and C. Team D requests 
Team C ignore the CAGES at the end of the MATCH, resulting in Teams A, B, and 
C not being able to earn the BARGE RP. Team C accepts this request from Team 
D. Team D’s motivation for this behavior is to prevent Team A from rising in the 
Tournament rankings negatively affecting Team D’s ranking. Team C has 
violated this rule.  
Example 2: A MATCH  is being played by Teams A, B, and C, in which Team A is 
assigned to participate as a SURROGATE. Team A accepts Team D’s request not 
to participate in the MATCH  so that Team D gains ranking position over Teams B 
and C. Team A has violated this rule.  
FIRST considers the action of a team influencing another team to throw a 
MATCH , to deliberately miss Ranking Points, etc. incompatible with FIRST  values 
and not a strategy any team should employ.  
G205  *Throwing your own MATCH  is bad.  A team may not intentionally lose a MATCH  or sacrifice Ranking 
Points in an effort to lower their own ranking or manipulate the rankings of other teams.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . RED  CARD if  subsequent violations during the event.  
The intent of this rule is not to punish teams who are employing alternate 
strategies,  but rather to ensure that it is clear that throwing MATCHES  to 
negatively affect your own rankings, or to manipulate the rankings of other teams 
(i.e. throw a MATCH  to lower a partner's ranking, and/or increase the ranking of 
another team not in the MATCH ) is incompatible with FIRST values and not a 
strategy any team should employ.  
G206  *Don't violate rules for RPs. A team or ALLIANCE  may not collude with another team  to each 
purposefully violate a rule in an attempt to influence  Ranking  Point s. 
Violation: YELLOW CARD and  the ALLIANCE  is ineligible for CORAL  and BARGE  RPs. 
For example, if Team A on the blue ALLIANCE agrees with Team F on the red 
ALLIANCE to contact each other's CAGES in TELEOP resulting in both 
ALLIANCES being awarded the BARGE RP.  
G207  *Don’t abuse ARENA access.  A team member (except DRIVERS, HUMAN PLAYERS, and COACHES) 
granted access to restricted areas in and around the ARENA (e.g. via TECHNICIAN button, event issued 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 60 of 164 Media badges, etc.) may not assist or use signaling devices during the MATCH. Exceptions will be 
granted for inconsequential infractions and in cases concerning safety.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD  if subsequent violations during the event. 
The TECHNICIAN’S role is to help the team prepare the ROBOT  so it can perform 
at its full potential during a MATCH . The TECHNICIAN, except as described at the 
end of s ection 6.2 DRIVE TEAM , is not an additional COACH, DRIVER, or HUMAN 
PLAYER.  
Team members in open- access spectator seating areas are not considered to be 
in a restricted area and are not prevented from assisting or using signaling 
devices. See E102  for related details.  
G208  *Show up to your MATCHES.  If a ROBOT has passed initial, complete inspection, at least 1 member of 
its DRIVE TEAM must report to the ARENA and participate in each of their assigned Qualification  
MATCHES.  
Violation: DISQUALIFIED .  
Figure 7-1 MATCH participation flowchart  
 
The team should inform the L ead Queuer if the team’s ROBOT is not able to 
participate.  
G209  *Keep your ROBOT  together. A ROBOT may not intentionally detach or leave a part on the FIELD.  
Violation: RED CARD.  

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 61 of 164 G210  *Don’t expect to gain by doing others harm.  A strateg y not consistent with standard gameplay and  
clearly aimed at forcing the opponent ALLIANCE to violate a rule is  not in the spirit of FIRST Robotics 
Competition and not allowed. Rule violations forced in this manner will not result in an assignment of a 
penalty to the targeted ALLIANC E. 
Violation : MAJOR FOUL . YELLOW CARD  if REPEATED.  
This rule does not apply for strategies consistent with standard gameplay, for 
example:  
A. a red ALLIANCE ROBOT attempting to climb in their BARGE ZONE in the final 
20 seconds of the MATCH contacts a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT. 
B. a blue ROBOT attempts to enter their REEF  ZONE  to score  a CORAL  and 
pushes a red ROBOT just outside the blue REEF  ZONE  into it.  
This rule requires an intentional act with limited or no opportunity for the team 
being acted on to avoid the penalty  such  as: 
C. forcing an opponent  ROBOT  to CONTROL more than 1 of either  SCORING 
ELEMENT  and violate G409 . 
D. a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT , pushing a red ALLIANCE ROBOT from fully outside 
and far from (i.e. more than 4 ft. (~121 cm))  the blue  BARGE ZONE through 
the blue  BARGE ZONE  while another red ROBOT is already on the opposing 
ALLIANCE’s side of the FIELD  and the REFEREE perceiving that the blue 
ROBOT is deliberately making the red ROBOT violate G421 . 
E. a blue ALLIANCE ROBOT , pushing a red ALLIANCE ROBOT from fully outside 
and far from (i.e. more than 4 ft. (~121 cm))  the blue BARGE ZONE  into a 
CAGE and the REFEREE perceiving that the blue ROBOT is deliberately 
making the red ROBOT violate G418 . 
G211  *Egregious or exceptional violations.  Egregious  behavior beyond what is listed in the rules or 
subsequent violations of any rule or procedure during the event is prohibited . 
In addition to rule violations explicitly listed in this manual and witnessed by a REFEREE, the Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for egregious ROBOT  actions or team member behavior 
at any time during the event.  
Please see section 6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS  for additional detail.   
Violation: YELLOW or RED CARD.  
The intent of this rule is to provide the Head REFEREES the flexibility necessary 
to keep the event running smoothly, as well as keep the safety of all the 
participants as the highest priority. Behaviors  that put the FIRST community or 
integrity of the game at risk  are not allowed and are violations of this rule . Those 
behaviors include, but are not limited to the list below:  
A. inappropriate behavior as outlined in the blue box of G201 , 
B. jumping over the guardrail,  
C. pushing past the FIELD reset person blocking an open gate to get on the 
FIELD,  
D. reaching into the FIELD and grabbing a ROBOT  during a MATCH , 
E. PINNING in excess of 15 seconds,  
F. exploiting the 3- second window after a MATCH described in section 6.5 
Scoring  to avoid rule violations (e.g. triggering an over -extension that enables 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 62 of 164 CAGE points or using a ROBOT’S residual energy to impact an opponent 
ROBOT on their BARGE ),  
G. triggering scoring sensors or otherwise interfering with FMS or FIELD 
operation,  
H. climbing on the BARGE, and  
I. throwing an ALGAE directly at an opponent ROBOT 
J. deliberately, running an AUTO to  disrupt the opponent ALLIANCE’S CAGES.  
K. deliberately, trying  to disrupt multiple  opponent ALLIANCE’S CAGES  during 
TELEOP . 
The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW or RED CARD for a single instance of 
a rule violation such as the examples given in items above, or for multiple 
instances of any single rule violation. Teams should be aware that any rule in this 
manual could escalate to a YELLOW or RED CARD. The Head REFEREE has final 
authority on all rules and violations at an event.  
G212  *All teams can play. A team may not encourage another team to exclude their ROBOT or be BYPASSED 
from a qualification MATCH for any reason.   
Violation: YELLOW CARD or RED CARD if the ROBOT does not participate in the MATCH.  
7.3 Pre-MATCH  
G301  *Be prompt. A DRIVE TEAM  member  may not cause significant delays to the start of their MATCH . 
Causing a significant delay requires both of the following to be true:  
A. The expected MATCH start time has passed, and  
Event volunteers communicate schedule delays with teams to the best of their 
ability. The Pit Display (which is typically located near the Pit Administration 
desk) shows any event timing delay. Announcements on the FIELD and in the pits 
also provide inform ation on delays, and any team uncertain of when to queue for 
a MATCH should communicate with queuing volunteers.  
During Qualification MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time 
indicated on the MATCH schedule or the cycle time for current round minus 3 
minutes  from the end of the previous MATCH (which is reflected on the schedule 
on the Pit Display), whichever is later.  
During Playoff MATCHES, the expected start time of the MATCH is the time 
indicated on the MATCH schedule or 15 minutes from either ALLIANCE’S 
previous MATCH, whichever is later.  
B. The DRIVE TEAM has access to the FIELD and is neither MATCH ready nor making a good faith 
effort, to quickly become MATCH ready.  
Teams that have violated G208  or have 1 DRIVE TEAM member present and have 
informed event staff that their ROBOT will not be participating in the MATCH are 
considered MATCH ready and not in violation of this rule.  
Violation: If a Qualification MATCH, VERBAL WARNING, or if a subsequent violation within the tournament 
phase, MAJOR FOUL  applied to their upcoming MATCH. If the DRIVE TEAM is not MATCH ready within 2 
minutes of the VERBAL WARNING /MAJOR FOUL  and the Head REFEREE perceives no good faith effort by 
the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, DISABLED. If a Playoff MATCH, VERBAL WARNING 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 63 of 164 issued the ALLIANCE, or if an ALLIANCE’S subsequent violation within the tournament phase, MAJOR 
FOUL  applied to their upcoming MATCH. If the ALLIANCE is not MATCH ready within 2 minutes of the 
VERBAL WARNING having been issued to all 3 teams/ MAJOR FOUL  and the Head REFEREE perceives no 
good faith effort by the DRIVE TEAM to quickly become MATCH ready, their ROBOT is DISABLED.  
The intent of this rule is to provide an equitable amount of time for both 
ALLIANCES to prepare for each MATCH and give DRIVE TEAMS grace given 
extenuating circumstances that cause them to be late.  
Once a VERBAL WARNING /MAJOR FOUL  is issued, the Head REFEREE starts a 
2-minute timer and makes a good faith effort to share the timer’s status with the 
delaying DRIVE TEAM.  
Being “MATCH ready” requires that the ROBOT is on the FIELD, in its STARTING 
CONFIGURATION, and turned on. Additionally, the DRIVE TEAM members must 
be in their starting positions.  
In general, good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH ready are entirely for the 
purposes of transitioning the ROBOT into a MATCH ready state (i.e. not attempts 
to significantly alter a ROBOT’s capabilities.) Examples of good faith efforts to 
quickly beco me MATCH ready include but are not limited to:  
A. walking safely towards the FIELD with a ROBOT that a team is not actively 
modifying,  
B. applying quick fixes such as tape or cable ties to make the ROBOT compliant 
with STARTING CONFIGURATION requirements,  
C. waiting for an OPERATOR CONSOLE computer to boot, and  
D. working with FIELD STAFF to get the ROBOT connected to the FIELD.  
Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly become MATCH 
ready include but are not limited to:  
E. a ROBOT not moving to the FIELD,  
F. a ROBOT moving to the FIELD but being actively modified while doing so,  
G. a DRIVE TEAM member remaining on the FIELD once a MATCH is ready to 
begin (indicated by the green LEDs having turned off),  
H. installing BUMPERS, charging pneumatic systems, or any other ROBOT 
maintenance not considered a quick fix as described in item B above once on 
the FIELD,  
I. time -consuming use of alignment devices that are external to the ROBOT 
(e.g. a DRIVE TEAM could bring and use a measuring tape, as long as there is 
no delay to the MATCH by doing so) , and  
J. repair s more substantial than those described in B.  
There are no rules that prohibit use of hand tools (including battery operated 
tools) while setting up ROBOTS from the FIELD, provided they do not cause 
significant delay or cause safety concerns.  
G302  *You can’t bring/use anything you want. The only equipment that may be brought to the ARENA for  use 
during  a MATCH is listed below. Regardless of if equipment fits criteria below, it may not be employed 
in a way that breaks any other rules, introduces a safety hazard, blocks visibility for FIELD STAFF or 
audience members, or jams or interferes with the remote sensing capabilities of another team or the FIELD.  
A. the OPERATOR CONSOLE,  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 64 of 164 B. non- powered signaling devices,  
C. reasonable decorative items,  
D. special clothing and/or equipment required due to a disability,  
E. devices used solely for planning, tracking, and communicating strategy within the same 
designated area (e.g. ALLIANCE AREA),  
F. devices used solely to record gameplay, and  
G. non- powered Personal Protective Equipment (examples include, but aren’t limited to, gloves, eye 
protection, and hearing protection) . 
Items brought to the ARENA under allowances B -G must meet all following conditions:  
I. do not connect or attach to the OPERATOR CONSOLE, FIELD, or ARENA,  
II. do not connect or attach to another ALLIANCE member (other than items in category G),  
III. do not communicate with anything or anyone outside of the ARENA,  
IV. do not communicate with the TECHNICIAN,  
V. do not include any form of enabled wireless electronic communication with the exception of medically required equipment, and  
VI. do not in any way affect the outcome of a MATCH, other than by allowing the DRIVE TEAM to  
a. plan or track strategy for the purposes of communication of that strategy to other ALLIANCE members or  
b. use items allowed per B  to communicate with the ROBOT. 
Violation: MATCH will not start until the situation is  remedied. If discovered or used inappropriately during 
a MATCH, YELLOW CARD.  
Examples of equipment that may be considered a safety hazard in the confined 
space of the ALLIANCE AREA include, but are not limited to, a folding step stool , 
ladder,  or a large signaling device.  
Examples of remote sensing capabilities include, but are not limited to, vision 
systems, acoustic range finders, sonars, and infrared proximity sensors.  
Use of imagery that, to a reasonably astute observer, mimics the April Tags 
employed on the FIELD is a violation of this rule.  
Examples of wireless communication include, but are not limited to, radios, 
walkie -talkies, cell phones, Bluetooth communications, and Wi- Fi. 
G303  *Start your ROBOTS.  A ROBOT  must  meet all following MATCH -start requirements:  
A. it does not pose a hazard to humans, FIELD elements, or other ROBOTS,  
B. has passed  initial, complete  inspection , i.e. it’s compliant  with all ROBOT rules (for exceptions 
regarding Practice MATCHES, see section 9 Inspection and Eligibility ), 
C. if modified after initial Inspection, it’s compliant with I104 , 
D. its BUMPERS overlap  their ROBOT STARTING LINE , 
E. it’s the only team -provided item left on the FIELD,  
F. it’s not attach ed to, entangl ed with, or suspend ed from  any FIELD element,  
G. it’s confined to its STARTING CONFIGURATION (reference R102 and R104 ), and 
H. it fully and solely support s not more than 1 CORAL  (as described in section 6.3.4 SCORING 
ELEMENTS ). 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 65 of 164 Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick 
remedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re- inspected. If a ROBOT not 
compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD.  
If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may 
not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head 
REFEREE or the FTA.  
For assessment of many of the items listed above,  the Head REFEREE is likely to 
consult with the LRI.  
7.4 In-MATCH  
Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  
7.4.1  AUTO 
The AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS 
operate with only their pre -programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  
G401  *Behind the lines.  In AUTO, each  DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE 
TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that 
HUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety , to press the E -Stop or A -Stop,  or 
granted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL  regardless of the number of items contacted.  
Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE 
such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA  elements is not a 
violation of this rule.  
An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE 
starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that 
circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up 
off the ground and re turn it to the shelf.  
G402  *Let the ROBOT do its thing.  In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM  member  may not directly or indirectly interact 
with  a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or 
pressing an E -Stop or A -Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER feeding CORAL  to a ROBOT  is an exception to  this 
rule.   
Violation: MINOR FOUL  and YELLOW CARD  
G403  Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a  ROBOT  whose BUMPERS are completely across the 
BARGE ZONE (i.e. to the opposite side of the BARGE ZONE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE ) may not 
contact an opponent ROBOT (either directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT  CONTROLLED 
by either ROBOT and regardless of who initiates contact).  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL  and VERBAL WARNING.  YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event.  
G404  No throwing in AUTO . In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field .  
Violation: MINOR FOUL . 
G405  No opponents CAGES in AUTO . In AUTO, a ROBOT may not contact an  opposing ALLIANCE’s CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL . 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 66 of 164 7.4.2  SCORING ELEMENT S 
G406  *ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENT S as directed . A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING 
ELEMENT  in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with  a FIELD element.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL .  
Examples include, but are not limited  to:  
A. launching SCORING ELEMENTS  at ROBOTS , 
B. using SCORING ELEMENT S to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to get on a 
CAGE, 
C. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS  to impede opponent access to their 
PROCESSOR , 
D. Placing a CORAL into the PROCESSOR, and 
E. Using CORAL to dislodge ALGAE from the REEF   
G407  *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS  in bounds.  A ROBOT may not intentionally eject a SCORING ELEMENT  
from the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) other than ALGAE 
through a PROCESSOR .  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL . 
G408  *Don’t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS.  Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING 
ELEMENT.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED  in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. If 
via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED . 
Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES.  
SCORING ELEMENTS  are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS , such as scratching or marking. Routinely 
gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS  are violations of 
this rule.  
G409  1 of each  at a time.  A ROBOT may not simultaneously CONTROL more than 1 CORAL and 1 ALGAE  
either directly or transitively through other objects . A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if  
A. the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT or  
B. the ROBOT intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or in a preferred direction (i.e. herding).  
A ROBOT pushing scored CORAL on level 1 while attempting to score other CORAL is an exception to this rule.  
Violation : MINOR FOUL  per additional SCORING ELEMENT . YELLOW CARD i f excessive. 
Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not “CONTROL” 
include, but are not limited to:  
A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT  while in the path 
of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD)  
B. “deflecting” (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT  that bounces into or off a 
ROBOT)  
C. inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while attempting to acquire a 
SCORING ELEMENT from the CORAL STATION.  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 67 of 164 It is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or  
unintentionally CONTROL more than the limit.  
Excessive  violations of CONTROL limits include, but are not limited to,  
simultaneous CONTROL of 3 or more CORAL or frequent , greater- than -
MOMENTARY  CONTROL (i.e. more than twice in a MATCH) of 2 or more CORAL .  
G410  No de -scoring.  A ROBOT may not de -score a CORAL scored on the opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL per de- scored CORAL and the opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the CORAL RP . 
G411  Don’t put ALGAE  on their REEF . A ROBOT may not deliberately put ALGAE on the ir opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD.  
G412  Only throw CORAL if in your REEF ZONE.  A ROBOT may not launch CORAL unless their BUMPERS are 
partially  in the ir REEF ZONE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL . 
A CORAL  is considered launched if it is shot into the air, kicked across the floor 
to a desired location or in a preferred direction, or thrown in a forceful way. 
“Bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path  of 
the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) is not considered launching.  
This rule is not intended to penalize typical movement of CORAL  outside an 
ALLIANCE’S REEF ZONE which come to rest a short distance (approximately 3 ft. 
(~92cm))  from the  ROBOT. Examples of such actions could be but are not 
limited to : 
A. Running an intake in reverse causing a CORAL  to travel a short  distance from 
the ROBOT  
B. A ROBOT pushing a CORAL  a short distance away in the process of  herding it 
across the FIELD  
7.4.3  ROBOT  
G413  *ROBOTS  must be safe . A ROBOT may not pose an undue  hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or 
another ROBOT in the following ways : 
A. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. a CORAL , contacts anything outside the FIELD except 
for MOMENTARY contact inside the C HUTE ,  
B. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  
C. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  
D. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,   
E. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE REPEATEDLY or for more than a MOMENTARY amount 
of time, or 
F. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe . 
Violation: DISABLED.  
Examples of dangerous operation or design s that likely pose undue hazards  
include, but are not limited to:  
A. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM,  
B. ROBOT parts “flailing” outside of the FIELD,  
C. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and  
D. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD.  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 68 of 164 Please be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA 
who may be in close proximity to your ROBOT.  
G414  *Keep your BUMPERS low . BUMPERS must be in the BUMPER ZONE (see  R405).  
Violation:  MINOR  FOUL .  
G415  Expansion limits . A ROBOT may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in. (~45 cm ) beyond the vertical projection 
of its ROBOT PERIMETER.  
If the over -expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, 
and no penalty is imposed.  
Violation:  MINOR  FOUL , or MAJOR  FOUL  if the over -expan sion is used for strategic benefit, including if it 
impedes or enables a scoring action . 
Examples of compliant  and non -complian t extensions  are shown in Figure 7 -2. 
ROBOT A violates this rule for having an extension that is too long, while ROBOTS 
B, C, and D do not violate this rule . 
Figure 7-2 Examples of compliance and non -compliance of this rule ( examples A and B are  side views, 
examples C and D are  top views ) 
 
The intent of this rule is to prevent piling  on a punitive response to a ROBOT 
that’s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. 
Examples for this rule include the following:  
A. a physical device on a team’s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their 
CORAL scoring arm from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a 
collision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now -
too-long extension to score SCORING ELEMENTS , no violation is assigned.  
B. a vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates 
out such that it breaches the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such 
that its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching their 
PROCESSOR . A MAJOR FOUL  is issued.  

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 69 of 164 G416  Don’t damage the FIELD . A ROBOT may not damage FIELD  element s. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . If the Head REFEREE infers that additional  damage is likely, DISABLED . 
YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp 
edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re- inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will 
be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES.  
G417  Watch  your FIELD interaction . A ROBOT  is prohibited from the following interact ions with  FIELD  
element s with the exception of CAGE S. 
A. grabbing,  
B. grasping,  
C. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet),  
D. becoming entangled with, and 
E. suspending from .  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL , plus YELLOW CARD i f REPEATED , or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head 
REFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending MECHANISM, and/or re- inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in 
subsequent MATCHES.  
G418  An Opponent’s CAGES are off -limits in TELEOP . In TELEOP, A ROBOT may not contact an opponent’s 
CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP if a Qualification MATCH.  
G419  ANCHORS  are off -limits.  A ROBOT may not contact  the ANCHORS . Exceptions are granted for actions 
that are inconsequential . 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and the ROBOT is ineligible for CAGE points . 
The intent of this rule is to disallow the use of the ANCHOR to ease the climbing 
challenge.  
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered inconsequential 
include, but are not limited to:  
A. bumping into the ANCHOR during an attempt to climb  
B. inadvertent contact while attempting to PARK  
C. inadvertent contact while driving through the BARGE ZONE  
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered consequential 
include, but are not limited to:  
D. Reacting against the ANCHOR to lift off the floor  
E. Reacting against the ANCHOR to stabilize the ROBOT (It is possible that 
certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT energy may still be 
considered inconsequential.)  
F. Overtly contacting the ANCHOR to stop the movement of the CAGE (It is 
possible that certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT 
energy may be still be considered inconsequential.) 
G420  NET  and contents are off- limits.  A ROBOT may not contact either NET  or any ALGAE scored in a n 
opponent  NET .  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. Additional MAJOR FOUL for each opponent ALGAE de -scored. 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 70 of 164 G421  1 defender at a time. No more than 1  ROBOT may be  on the opponent’s  side of the FIELD (i.e. 
containing the opponent REEF)  with its BUMPERS fully outside and beyond the BARGE ZONES . 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
7.4.4  Opponent Interaction  
Note, G422 , G423 , G424 are mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT  to ROBOT  interaction which violates more 
than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed.  
G422  *Stay out of other ROBOTS.  A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its ROBOT PERIMETER 
(except its BUMPERS) to initiate contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of the 
opponent ’s ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL . 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiate contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT .  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS  to initiate contact.  
G423  *This isn’t combat robotics.  A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in 
either of the following ways:  
A. deliberately.  
B. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT  
CONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside the vertical projection of an opponent ’s ROBOT  
PERIMETER.  
Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped -over opponent ROBOT, which is not 
perceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL  and YELLOW CARD , or if opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL  
and RED CARD . 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full -contact competition and may include 
rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, 
teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust.  
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and 
unintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT 
PERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT.  
B. A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a 
single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and damages a 
COMPONENT inside that opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER. 
C. A ROBOT high -speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent 
ROBOT and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was 
deliberately trying to damage the opponent’s ROBOT.  
Examples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not limited to:  
D. opening an opponent’s relief valve such that the opponent’s air pressure 
drops and  
E. powering off an opponent’s ROBOT (this example also clearly results in a RED 
CARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive).  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 71 of 164 At the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually inspect 
a ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH and remove the 
violation if the damage cannot be verified.  
For the purposes of this rule, “initiating contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact.  
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable  to drive.  
G424  *Don’t tip or entangle.  A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent 
ROBOT.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL  and YELLOW CARD , or if CONTINUOUS or opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, 
then MAJOR FOUL  and RED CARD.  
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. using a wedge -like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS,  
B. making BUMPER- to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is 
attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall 
over again, and  
C. causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after it 
starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact could have been 
avoided.  
Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT interaction, 
including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a ROBOT tipping, is not a 
violation of this rule.  
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable  to drive.  
G425  *There’s a 3-count on PINS. A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent’s ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A 
ROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or 
transitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria below are met:  
A. the ROBOTS  have separated by at least 6 ft. (~183 cm) from each other  for more than 3 
seconds,  
B. either ROBOT  has moved 6 ft. from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds, or  
C. the PINNING ROBOT  gets PINNED.  
For criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 6 ft. until either the PIN ends or the PINNING ROBOT moves back within 6 ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed.  
For criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 6ft from where the PIN initiated until the PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 6ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL , and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected , a MAJOR FOUL  is 
assessed. 
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 72 of 164 A team’s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a 
ROBOT  is PINNED.  
G426  *Don’t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. 2 or more ROBOTS that 
appear to a REFEREE to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of MATCH 
play.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL , and  for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL  is 
assessed. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS ,   
B. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,  
C. blocking all access to the  opponent’s  PROCESSOR , and  
D. blocking all access to the opponent’s CAGES . 
A single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD is not a 
violation of this rule.  
2 ROBOTS independently playing defense on 2 opponent ROBOTS is not a 
violation of this rule.  
G427  ZONE  protection . A ROBOT may not contact , directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT , an 
opponent ROBOT partially  or fully  inside the opponent’s BARGE ZONE or REEF  ZONE regardless of who 
initiates contact .  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL . 
ROBOTS that contact each other while in their respective BARGE ZONES  may 
result in a violation for both ALLIANCES  
G428  CAGE protection . A ROBOT may not contact , directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT , an 
opponent ROBOT in contact with an opponent CAGE  during the last 20 seconds  regardless of who 
initiates contact .  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and the opponent ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP  
7.4.5  Human  
G429  *No wandering. A DRIVE TEAM member  must remain in their designated area as follows:  
A. DRIVER S and COACH ES may not contact anything outside the ir ALLIANCE AREA,  
B. a DRIVER must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the DRIVER STATION to which they are 
assigned, as indicated on the team sign,  
C. a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside the ir ALLIANCE AREA or their PROCESSOR 
AREA , and  
D. a TECHNICIAN may not contact anything outside their designated area.  
Exceptions are granted  as follows:  
E. for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the ALLIANCE or PROCESSOR  AREA,  
F. in cases concerning safety , and  
G. for actions that are inadvertent, MOMENTARY, and inconsequential. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 73 of 164 An intent of item B  is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to 
OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves  
about the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties  
associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area,  
we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR  
CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within  
close proximity of their DRIVER STATION, there will be no repercussions.  
However, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a  
DRIVER STATION width away from their own DRIVER STATION while using their  
OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule.  
G430  *COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls.  A ROBOT shall be operated only by the DRIVERS 
and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team.  A COACH activating their E -Stop or A -Stop is the exception to 
this rule.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL . RED CARD if  greater -than -MOMENTARY.  
Exceptions may be made before a MATCH  for major conflicts, e.g. religious 
holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc.  
G431  *DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach.  A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend into the CHUTE.   
Violation: MINOR FOUL .  
G432  *Humans : use SCORING ELEMENT S as directed. A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a 
SCORING ELEMENT  in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.   
Violation: MAJOR FOUL .  
Examples include, but are not limited to:  
A. a HUMAN PLAYER uses an ALGAE to disrupt an opponent ROBOT  
G433  *SCORING ELEMENT  delivery. SCORING  ELEMENTS may only be entered onto the FIELD as follows:  
A. CORAL  may only be introduced to the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or DRIVER through the CORAL 
STATION and 
B. ALGAE may only be entered onto the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER in their PROCESSOR  AREA. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL .  
G434  *COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits. COACHES may not touch SCORING ELEMENTS , unless 
for safety purposes.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL . 
G435  The PROCESSOR AREA has a storage limit.  HUMAN PLAYERS may not store more than 4 ALGAE in the 
PROCESSOR AREA . ALGAE can only be stored in the following locations:  
A. 3 in the holders on top of the PROCESSOR , and  
B. 1 at the end of the PROCESSOR exit ramp  
HUMAN PLAYERS making a good -faith effort to immediately move or enter additional ALGAE is an 
exception to  this rule.   
Violation: MAJOR FOUL per additional ALGAE.  
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)  V11 74 of 164 7.5 Post -MATCH  
G501  *Leave promptly. A DRIVE TEAM member  may not cause significant or multiple delays to the start of a 
subsequent MATCH, scheduled break content, or other FIELD activities.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . YELLOW CARD if  subsequent violations at any point during the event.  
 

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 75 of 164 8 ROBOT  Construction Rules  (R) 
The rules listed below explicitly address legal parts and materials and how those parts and materials may be 
used on a REEFSCAPE ROBOT . A ROBOT  is an electromechanical assembly built by the FIRST Robotics 
Competition team to play the current season’s game and includes all the basic systems required to be an active participant in the game –power, communications, control, BUMPERS , and movement about the FIELD. A 
BUMPER  is a protective assembly designed to attach to the exterior of the ROBOT  and constructed as  
specified in section 8.4 BUMPER Rules . 
There are many reasons for the structure of the rules, including safety, reliability, parity, creation of a reasonable design challenge, adherence to professional standards, impact on the competition, and compatibility with the Kit of Parts (KOP). The KOP is the collection of items listed on the current season’s 
Kickoff Kit Checklists, distributed to the team via FIRST Choice in the current season, or paid for completely 
(except shipping) with a Product Donation Voucher (PDV) from the current season.  
Another intent of these rules is to have all energy sources and active actuation systems on the ROBOT  (e.g. 
batteries, compressors, motors, servos, cylinders, and their controllers) drawn from a well -defined set of 
options. This is to ensure that all teams have access to the same actuation resources and that the INSPECTORS are able to accurately and effic iently assess the legality of a given part.  
ROBOTS  are made up of COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS. A COMPONENT is any part in its most basic 
configuration, which cannot be disassembled without damaging or destroying the part or altering its fundamental function. A MECHANISM is an assembly of COMPONENTS that pro vide specific functionality on 
the ROBOT . A MECHANISM can be disassembled (and then reassembled) into individual COMPONENTS 
without damage to the parts.  
Many rules in this section reference Commercial -Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items. A COTS item must be a standard 
(i.e. not custom order) part commonly available from a VENDOR for all teams for purchase. To be a COTS item, 
the COMPONENT or MECHANISM must be in an unaltered, unmodified state (with the exception of installation 
or modification of any software). Items that are no longer commercially available but are functionally 
equivalent to the original condition as delivered from the VENDOR are considered COTS an d may be used.  
Example 1: A team orders 2 ROBOT  grippers from RoboHands Corp. and receives 
both items. They put 1 in their storeroom and plan to use it later. Into the other, 
they drill “lightening holes” to reduce weight. The first gripper is still classified as 
a COTS item, but the second gripper is now a FABRICATED ITEM, as it has been 
modified.  
Example 2: A team obtains openly available blueprints of a drive module 
commonly available from Wheels -R-Us Inc. and has local machine shop “We -
Make -It, Inc.” manufacture a copy of the part for them. The produced part is not a 
COTS item, because it is not commonly carried as part of the standard stock of 
We-Make -It, Inc.  
Example 3: A team obtains openly available design drawings from a professional 
publication during the pre -season and uses them to fabricate a gearbox for their 
ROBOT  during the build period following Kickoff. The design drawings are 
considered a COTS item and may be used as “raw material” to fabricate the 
gearbox. The finished gearbox itself would be a FABRICATED ITEM, and not a 
COTS item.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 76 of 164 Example 4: A COTS part that has non -functional label markings added would still 
be considered a COTS part, but a COTS part that has device -specific mounting 
holes added is a FABRICATED ITEM.  
Example 5: A team has a COTS single -board processor version 1.0, which can no 
longer be purchased. Only the COTS single -board processor version 2.0 may be 
purchased. If the COTS single -board processor version 1.0 is functionally 
equivalent to its original condition, it may be used.  
Example 6: A team has a COTS gearbox which has been discontinued. If the 
COTS gearbox is functionally equivalent to its original condition, it may be used.  
A VENDOR is a legitimate business source for COTS items that satisfies all the following criteria:  
A. has a Federal Tax Identification number. In cases where the VENDOR is outside of the United 
States, they must possess an equivalent form of registration or license with the government of their home nation that establishes and validates their status as a legitimate business licensed to operate within that country.  
B. is not a “wholly owned subsidiary” of a FIRST Robotics Competition team or collection of teams. 
While there may be some individuals affiliated with both a team and the VENDOR, the business and activities of the team and VENDOR must be completely separable.  
C. should maintain sufficient stock or production capability so they are able to ship any general (i.e., non -FIRST unique) product within 5 business days of receiving a valid purchase request. It 
is recognized that certain unusual circumstances (such as such as a global supply chain disruption and/or 1,000 FIRST teams all ordering the same part at once from the same 
VENDOR) may cause atypical delays in shipping due to backorders for even the largest VENDORS. Such delays due to higher -than -normal order rates ar e excused. This criterion may 
not apply to custom -built items from a source that is both a VENDOR and a fabricator.  
For example, a VENDOR may sell flexible belting that the team wishes to procure 
to use as treads on their drive system. The VENDOR cuts the belting to a custom 
length from standard shelf stock that is typically available, welds it into a loop to 
make a tre ad, and ships it to a team. The fabrication of the tread takes the 
VENDOR 2 weeks. This would be considered a FABRICATED ITEM, and the 2 -
week ship time is acceptable. Alternately, the team may decide to fabricate the 
treads themselves. To satisfy this crit erion, the VENDOR would just have to ship 
a length of belting from shelf stock (i.e. a COTS item) to the team within 5 
business days and leave the welding of the cuts to the team.  
D. makes their products available to all FIRST Robotics Competition teams. A VENDOR must not 
limit supply or make a product available to just a limited number of FIRST Robotics Competition 
teams.  
The intent of this definition is to be as inclusive as possible to permit access to 
all legitimate sources, while preventing ad hoc organizations from providing 
special -purpose products to a limited subset of teams in an attempt to 
circumvent the cost acco unting rules.  
FIRST desires to permit teams to have the broadest choice of legitimate sources 
possible, and to obtain COTS items from the sources that provide them with the 
best prices and level of service available. Teams also need to protect against 
long delays in availability of parts that will impact their ability to complete their 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 77 of 164 ROBOT . The build season is brief, so the VENDOR must be able to get their 
product, particularly FIRST unique items, to a team in a timely manner.  
Ideally, chosen VENDORS should have national distributors (e.g. Home Depot, 
Lowes, MSC, McMaster- Carr, etc.). Remember, FIRST Robotics Competition 
events are not always near home – when parts fail, local access to replacement 
materials is often critical.  
A FABRICATED ITEM is any COMPONENT or MECHANISM that has been altered, built, cast, constructed, 
concocted, created, cut, heat treated, machined, manufactured, modified, painted, produced, surface coated, or conjured partially or completely into the final form in which it will be used on the ROBOT . 
Note that it is possible for an item (typically raw materials) to be neither COTS 
nor a FABRICATED ITEM. For example, a 20 ft. (~610 cm) length of aluminum 
which has been cut into 5 ft. (~152 cm) pieces by the team for storage or 
transport is neither COTS (it’s not in the state received from the VENDOR), nor a 
FABRICATED ITEM (the cuts were not made to advance the part towards its final 
form on the ROBOT ). 
Teams may be asked to provide documentation proving the legality  of non -REEFSCAPE KOP items during 
inspection where a rule specifies limits for a legal part (e.g. pneumatic items, current limits, COTS electronics, etc.). 
Some of these rules make use of English unit requirements for parts. If your team has a question about a 
metric -equivalent part’s legality, please e -mail your question to the FIRST Robotics Competition Kit of Parts 
team at frcparts@firstinspires.org  for an official ruling. To seek approval for alternate devices for inclusion in 
future FIRST Robotics Competition seasons, please contact the Kit of Parts team at frcparts@firstinspires.org  
with item specifications.  
Teams should acknowledge the support provided by the corporate sponsors and mentors with an appropriate display of their school and sponsors names and/or logos (or the name of the supporting youth organization, if appropriate). 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full -contact competition and may include rigorous game play. While the 
rules aim to limit severe damage to ROBOTS , teams should design their ROBOTS  to be robust.  
8.1 General ROBOT  Design  
R101  *ROBOT  PERIMETER must be fixed. The ROBOT  (excluding BUMPERS ) must have a ROBOT 
PERIMETER , contained within the BUMPER ZONE  and established while in the ROBOT ’S STARTING 
CONFIGURATION, that is comprised of fixed, non -articulated  structural elements of the ROBOT . Minor 
protrusions no greater than ¼ in. (~6 mm) such as bolt heads, fastener ends, weld beads, and rivets are 
not considered part of the ROBOT  PERIMETER. 
To determine the ROBOT PERIMETER, wrap a piece of string around the outer 
most parts of the  ROBOT  (excluding BUMPERS ) at the BUMPER ZONE described 
in R405  and pull it taut. The string outlines the ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Example: A ROBOT ’S chassis is shaped like the letter ‘ U’, with a large gap 
between chassis elements on the front of the ROBOT . When wrapping a taut 
string around this chassis, the string extends across the gap and the resulting 
ROBOT PERIMETER is a rectangle with 4 sides.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 78 of 164 Figure 8-1 ROBOT  PERIMETER example  
 
R102  *STARTING CONFIGURATION – no overhang. In the STARTING CONFIGURATION (the physical 
configuration in which a ROBOT  starts a MATCH ), no part of the ROBOT  shall extend outside the 
vertical projection of the ROBOT PERIMETER, with the exception of its BUMPERS  and minor protrusions 
such as bolt heads, fastener ends, rivets, cable ties, etc.  
If a ROBOT  is designed as intended and each side is pushed up against a vertical 
wall (in STARTING CONFIGURATION and with BUMPERS  removed), only the 
ROBOT PERIMETER (or minor protrusions) will be in contact with the wall.  
The allowance for minor protrusions in this rule is intended to allow protrusions 
that are both minor in extension from the ROBOT PERIMETER and cross -
sectional area.  
If a ROBOT  uses interchangeable MECHANISMS per I103 , Teams should be 
prepared to show compliance with this rule and R105  in all configurations.  
R103  *ROBOT  weight limit. The ROBOT  weight must not exceed 1 15 lbs. (~52 kg). When determining weight, 
the basic ROBOT  structure and all elements of all additional MECHANISMS that might be used in a 
single configuration of the ROBOT  shall be weighed together (see  I103 ).  
For the purposes of determining compliance with the weight limitations, the following items are 
excluded:  
A. ROBOT  BUMPERS ,  
B. ROBOT  battery and its associated half of the Anderson cable quick connect/disconnect pair 
(including no more than 12 in. (~30 cm) of cable per leg, the associated cable lugs, connecting bolts, and insulation), and  
C. tags used for location detection systems if provided by the event.  
R104  STARTING CONFIGURATION – max size. A ROBOT ’S STARTING CONFIGURATION may not have a 
ROBOT PERIMETER greater than 120 in. (~304 cm) and may not be more than 3 ft. 6 in.  (~106 cm) tall.  
Be sure to consider the size of the ROBOT  on its cart to make sure it will fit 
through doors. Also consider the size of the ROBOT  to ensure that it will fit into a 
shipping crate, vehicle, etc.  
Note that rules contained in section 8.4 BUMPER Rules  may impose additional 
restrictions on ROBOT  design.  
R105  ROBOT  extension limit. ROBOTS  may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in.  (~457 mm ) beyond the vertical 
projection of their ROBOT PERIMETER.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 79 of 164 Figure 8-2 ROBOT  PERIMETER extension  
 
Teams should expect to have to demonstrate a ROBOT ’S ability to constrain 
itself per above during inspection. Constraints may be implemented with either 
hardware or software.  
See section 7.4.3 ROBOT  for height  and extension restrictions for various areas 
of the FIELD.  
8.2 ROBOT  Safety & Damage Prevention  
R201  *No digging into carpet. Traction devices must not have surface features that could damage the 
ARENA  (e.g. metal, sandpaper, inflexible  studs, cleats, hook -loop fasteners or similar attachments). 
Traction devices include all parts of the ROBOT  that are designed to transmit any propulsive and/or 
braking forces between the ROBOT  and FIELD carpet.  
R202  *No exposed sharp edges. Protrusions from the ROBOT  and exposed surfaces on the ROBOT  shall not 
pose hazards to the ARENA  elements (including SCORING ELEMENTS ) or people.  
R203  *General safety.  ROBOT  parts shall not be made from hazardous materials, be unsafe, cause an unsafe 
condition, or interfere with the operation of other ROBOTS . 
Examples of items that will violate this rule include (but are not limited to):  
A. shields, curtains, or any other devices or materials designed or used to 
obstruct or limit the vision of any DRIVE TEAM members and/or interfere with 
their ability to safely control their ROBOT , 
B. speakers, sirens, air horns, or other audio devices that generate sound at a 
level sufficient to be a distraction,  
C. any devices or decorations specifically intended to jam or interfere with the 
remote sensing capabilities of another ROBOT , including vision systems, 
acoustic range finders, sonars, infrared proximity detectors, etc. (e.g. 
including imagery on your ROBOT  that utilizes or closely mimics 36h11 
AprilTags ), 
D. exposed lasers other than Class I,  
E. flammable gasses,  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 80 of 164 F. any device intended to produce flames or pyrotechnics,  
G. hydraulic fluids or hydraulic items,  
H. switches or contacts containing liquid mercury,  
I. circuitry used to create voltages in excess of 24 Volts,  
J. any ballast not secured sufficiently, including loose ballast e.g. sand, ball 
bearings, etc., such that it may become loose during a MATCH , 
K. exposed, untreated hazardous materials (e.g. lead weights) used on the 
ROBOT . These materials may be permitted if painted, encapsulated, or 
otherwise sealed to prevent contact. These materials may not be machined 
in any way at an event.  
L. tire sealant, and  
M. high intensity light sources used on the ROBOT  (e.g. super bright LED 
sources marketed as ‘military grade’ or ‘self -defense’) may only be 
illuminated for a brief time while targeting and may need to be shrouded to 
prevent any exposure to participants. Complaints about the use of such light 
sources wil l be followed by re -inspection and possible disablement of the 
device.  
R204  *Leave SCORING ELEMENTS  at the FIELD.  ROBOTS  must allow removal of SCORING ELEMENTS  from 
the ROBOT  and the ROBOT  from FIELD elements while DISABLED and powered off.  
ROBOTS  will not be re -enabled after the MATCH , so teams must be sure that 
SCORING ELEMENTS  and ROBOTS  can be quickly, simply, and safely removed.  
Teams are encouraged to consider G501 when developing their ROBOTS . 
R205  *Don’t contaminate the FIELD. Lubricants may be used only to reduce friction within the ROBOT. 
Lubricants must not contaminate the FIELD or other ROBOTS . 
R206  *Don’t damage SCORING ELEMENTS . ROBOT  elements likely to come in contact with a SCORING 
ELEMENT  shall not pose a significant hazard to the SCORING ELEMENT . 
SCORING ELEMENTS  are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS , such as scratching or marking. Gouging, 
tearing off pieces, or routinely marking SCORING ELEMENTS  are violations of 
this rule.  
8.3 Budget Constraints & Fabrication Schedule  
R301  *Individual item cost limit.  No individual, non -KOP item or software shall have a Fair Market Value 
(FMV) that exceeds $600 USD. The total cost of COMPONENTS purchased in bulk may exceed $600 
USD as long as the cost of an individual COMPONENT does not exceed $600 USD.  
Teams should be ready to show INSPECTORS documentation of FMV for any 
COMPONENTS that appear to be in the range of the $600 USD limit.  
The Analog Devices IMU MXP Breakout Board, P/N ADIS16448, does not have a 
published FMV. This device is considered to comply with this rule regardless of 
its true FMV.  
The FMV of a COTS item is its price defined by a VENDOR for the part or an 
identical functional replacement. This price must be generally available to all 
FIRST Robotics Competition teams throughout the build and competition season 
(i.e. short -term sale prices or coupons do not reflect FMV), however teams are 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 81 of 164 only expected to make a good faith effort at determining the item price and are 
not expected to monitor prices of ROBOT  items throughout the season. The FMV 
is the cost of the item itself and does not include any duties, taxes, tariffs, 
shipping, or other costs that may vary by locality.  
The FMV of COTS software is the price, set by the VENDOR, to license the 
software (or piece of the software) that runs on the ROBOT  for the period from 
Kickoff to the end of the FIRST Championship. The FMV of software licensed 
free-of-cost, including through the Virtual KOP, for use on the ROBOT  is $0.  
The FMV of FABRICATED parts is the value of the material and/or labor, except 
for labor provided by team members (including sponsor employees who are 
members of the team), members of other teams, and/or event provided machine 
shops. Material costs are accounted for as the cost of any purchasable quantity 
that can be used to make the individual part (i.e. the purchasable raw material is 
larger than the FABRICATED part).  
Example 1: A team orders a custom bracket made by a company to the team's 
specification. The company’s material cost and normally charged labor rate 
apply.  
Example 2: A team receives a donated sensor. The company would normally sell 
this item for $450 USD, which is therefore its FMV.  
Example 3: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by a local machine shop. The machine shop is not considered a team 
sponsor but donates 2 hours of expended labor anyway. The team must include 
the estimated normal cost of the  labor as if it were paid to the machine shop and 
add it to the $400 USD.  
Example 4: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by a local machine shop that is a recognized sponsor of the team. If 
the machinists are considered members of the team, their labor costs do not 
apply. The total applicable co st for the part would be $400 USD.  
It is in the best interests of the teams and FIRST  to form relationships with as 
many organizations as possible. Recognizing supporting companies as sponsors 
of, and members in, the team is encouraged, even if the involvement of the 
sponsor is solely through the donation of fabrication labor.  
Example 5: A team purchases titanium tube stock for $400 USD and has it 
machined by another team. The total applicable cost for the part would be $400 
USD.  
Example 6: A team purchases a widget at a garage sale or online auction for 
$300, but it’s available for sale from a VENDOR for $700. The FMV is $700.  
If a COTS item is part of a modular system that can be assembled in several 
possible configurations, then each individual module must fit within the price 
constraints defined in this rule.  
If the modules are designed to assemble into a single configuration, and the 
assembly is functional in only that configuration, then the total cost of the 
complete assembly including all modules must fit within the price constraints 
defined in this rule.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 82 of 164 In summary, if a VENDOR sells a system or a kit, a team must use the entire 
system/kit FMV and not the value of its COMPONENT pieces.  
Example 7: VENDOR A sells a gearbox that can be used with a number of 
different gear sets, and can mate with 2 different motors they sell. A team 
purchases the gearbox, a gear set, and a motor, then assembles them together. 
Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining FMV since the 
purchased pieces can each be used in various configurations.  
Example 8: VENDOR B sells a robotic  arm assembly that a team wants to use. 
However, it costs $630 USD, so they cannot use it. The VENDOR sells the “hand”, 
“wrist”, and “arm” as separate assemblies, for $210 USD each. A team wishes to 
purchase the 3 items separately, then reassemble them. Th is would not be legal, 
as they are really buying and using the entire assembly, which has a Fair Market 
Value of $630 USD.  
Example 9: VENDOR C sells a set of wheels or wheel modules that are often used 
in groups of 4. The wheels or modules can be used in other quantities or 
configurations. A team purchases 4 and uses them in the most common 
configuration. Each part is treated separately for the purpose of determining 
FMV, since the purchased pieces can be used in various configurations.  
R302  *MAJOR MECHANISM , from this year only. MAJOR MECHANISMS , as defined in I101 , created before 
Kickoff are not permitted . 
Neither this rule nor the language in this blue box define specific thresholds for 
how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be constructed after Kickoff. This rule 
expects and requires the team’s honest assessment of whether they built the 
MAJOR MECHANISMS of their ROBOT after Kickoff. 
Attempts to exploit loopholes in the definition of MAJOR MECHANISM in order to 
bypass this requirement are in the spirit of neither this rule nor FIRST Robotics 
Competition. Examples of exploitation include:  
A. Pre-assembling significant portions of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to Kickoff 
and attaching those assemblies together post -Kickoff  
B. Removing a small COMPONENT of a MAJOR MECHANISM prior to Kickoff 
such that it is no longer a MAJOR MECHANISM and replacing it after Kickoff.  
R303  *Create new designs and software, unless they’re public. ROBOT  software and designs created before 
Kickoff are only permitted if the source files (complete information sufficient to produce the design) 
are available publicly prior to Kickoff.  
Example 1: A team realizes that the transmission designed and built in the fall 
perfectly fits their need for a transmission to drive the ROBOT  arm. They build an 
exact copy of the transmission from the original design plans and  bolt it to the 
ROBOT . This would be prohibited, as the transmission – although made during 
the competition season – was built from detailed designs developed prior to 
Kickoff.  
Example 2: A team developed an omni -directional drive system for the 2019 
competition. In July 2019 they refined and improved the control software, written 
in C++, to add more precision and capabilities. They decided to use a similar 
system for the REEFSCAPE competition. They copied large sections of 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 83 of 164 unmodified code over into the control software of the new ROBOT , also written in 
C++. This would be a violation of the schedule constraint and is not allowed.  
Example 3: The same team decides to use LabVIEW as their software 
environment for REEFSCAPE. Following Kickoff, they use the previously 
developed C++ code as a reference for the algorithms and calculations required 
to implement their omni -directional control solution. Because they developed 
new LabVIEW code as they ported over their algorithms, this is permitted.  
Example 4: A different team develops a similar solution during the fall and plans 
to use the developed software on their competition ROBOT . After completing the 
software, they post it in a generally accessible public forum and make the code 
available to all teams. Because they have made their software publicly available 
before Kickoff, they can use it on their ROBOT . 
Example 5: A team develops a transmission prior to Kickoff. After completing the 
project, they publish the CAD files on a generally accessible public forum and 
make them available to all teams. Because they have made the design publicly 
available before Kickoff, they can use the design to create an identical 
transmission, fabricated after Kickoff, for use on their REEFSCAPE ROBOT . 
R304  *During an event, only work during pit hours.  During an event a team is attending (regardless of 
whether the team is physically at the event location), the team may neither work on nor practice with 
their ROBOT  or ROBOT  elements outside of the hours that pits are open, with the following exceptions:  
A. OPERATOR CONSOLES , BUMPERS, battery assemblies ( as described in  R103-B ), 
B. COTS items with minor modifications ( attachment of connectors, assembly of COTS items per 
manufacturer instructions, labeling or decoration, etc.)  
C. software development, and  
D. charging batteries.  
For the purposes of this rule, official events begin as follows:  
− Regionals, District Championships, and FIRST Championship: at the start of 
the first designated load -in period, according to the Public Schedule. If the 
Public Schedule is not available or there is no designated load -in period, the 
events begin at 4pm on the day prior to pits opening.  
− District Events: when pits open  
Examples of activity prohibited by this rule include:  
A. working on the ROBOT  at the team’s shop after load -in for the event has 
begun,  
B. working on ROBOT  parts at night at the team’s hotel, and  
C. running a 3D printer or other automated manufacturing process overnight 
producing ROBOT  parts.  
Note that E107  and E401 impose additional restrictions on work done on the 
ROBOT  or ROBOT  materials while attending an event.  
This rule is intended to increase equity between teams with significant travel to 
an event and those nearby (close teams would otherwise have an advantage by 
being able to work on their ROBOT , in their shop, until it’s time to go to the event).  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 84 of 164 8.4 BUMPER  Rules   
A BUMPER  is a required assembly which attaches to the ROBOT  frame. BUMPERS  protect ROBOTS  from 
damaging/being damaged by other ROBOTS  and FIELD elements.  
A BUMPER guide providing  additional information on materials and design based on historical best practices  
may be found under the Mechanical Resources section of the Technical Resources page . Teams may also 
reference the KitBot Instructions  for a detailed step -by-step on how to build bumpers for the KitBot.  
All dimensions specified in this section are nominal and will be measured during inspection with a tolerance of 
¼ in. (~6 mm) unless otherwise specified. This means that maximums specified have a tolerance of + ¼ in. 
and minimums specified have a tolerance of – ¼ in. Teams are encouraged to design to the nominal 
dimension and reserve the toleranc e for unexpected deviation such as manufacturing error or tolerance stack -
up. 
R401  *BUMPERS  all around . ROBOTS  are required to use BUMPERS  to protect the entire  ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Gaps of less than 1 ¼ in. (~31 mm)  between adjacent segments are permitted as long as all corners 
are filled per R406. 
Figure 8-3 BUMPER coverage requirements  
 
R402  *BUMPER  construction.  BUMPERS must consist of the following:  
A. Padding – A minimum of 2  ¼ in. (~58 m m) depth of foam padding, at least 4 ½ in. (~114 m m) 
tall consisting of solid blocks, sheets, or stacked rods of one or more of the following materials:  
i. Pool noodles (hollow or solid) or backer rod  
ii. Solid polyethylene closed cell foam with density between 1.5 and 3 lb./ft.3 (~24  to 48  
kg/m3) 
iii. Solid EVA closed cell foam with density between 2 and 6 lb./ft.3 (~32 to 96 kg/m3) 
iv. Foam floor tiles  
Multiple types, shapes, and/or layers of foam may be used within a single BUMPER.  
Teams should be prepared to provide information about the padding 
material used in their BUMPERS . Teams  do not need to have a separate 

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 85 of 164 material sample or expose padding for direct inspection  to show 
compliance with this rule.  
B. Backing  – A backer at least 4  ½ in. (~115 mm) tall which supports the padding (i.e. padding is 
not cantilevered other than in corners) and facilitates installation and removal of the BUMPER 
from the ROBOT  (as noted in  R410 ). Additional elements may be added to strengthen the 
backing, fill space between the BUMPER and ROBOT frame, or serve as part of the attachment system.  
Figure 8-4 BUMPER backing supporting padding (cross section)
 
C. Cover  – Cloth  (as noted in  R411 ) which covers all outward, upward and downward facing 
surfaces of padding  such that no padding is exposed to interaction with the FIELD or other 
ROBOTs.  
D. Fastening System  – BUMPERS must attach to the ROBOT PERIMETER with a rigid fastening 
system to form a tight, robust connection to the main structure/frame (e.g. not attached with hook -and-loop tape, tape, or cable ties). The  fastening  system must be designed to withstand 
vigorous game play. All removable fasteners (e.g. bolts, locking pins, quick release pins, etc.) may be considered part of either the BUMPERS or ROBOT for determination of weight per R103 
and R408. 
The BUMPER Rules provide teams significant freedom in choosing 
designs and materials. For information on a reference design , see the 
Bumper Guide under the Mechanical Resources section of the Technical 
Resources page . 

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 86 of 164 Figure 8-5 BUMPER Cross Section  Example  
 
R403  *BUMPER extension limit.  BUMPERS must not extend more than 4 in. ( ~101  mm) from the ROBOT 
PERIMETER.  
R404  *BUMPERS must be soft.  Hard parts of BUMPERS must not extend more than 1  ¼ in. (~31 mm)  from 
the ROBOT PERIMETER. Only padding (per R402 -A), cover (per R402-C , including any coatings or 
markings), and soft fasteners used to secure padding or cover are permitted beyond this limit. Padding 
must extend at least 2 in.  (~51 mm)  beyond any hard parts of the BUMPER.  
Hard parts include any items which are likely to cause damage to the cloth  or 
padding of other BUMPERS such as nuts and bolts, cable ties, hard plastics, etc.  
R405  *BUMPERS  interact with BUMPERS.  All BUMPERS must have p adding (per  R402-A) supported by 
backing (per R402 -B) entirely filling  the BUMPER ZONE, a space between 2  ½ in.  (~63 mm)  and 5 ¾ in. 
(~146 mm)  from the floor.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 87 of 164 Figure 8-6 BUMPER ZONE examples  
 
This measurement is intended to be made as if the ROBOT is resting on a flat 
floor (without changing the ROBOT configuration), not relative to the current 
height of the ROBOT from the FIELD carpet at any given time. Examples include:  
Example 1: A ROBOT that is at an angle while navigating the FIELD has its 
BUMPERS outside the BUMPER ZONE. If this ROBOT were virtually transposed 
onto a flat floor, and its BUMPERS are in the BUMPER ZONE, it meets the 
requirements of this rule.  
Example 2: A ROBOT deploys a MECHANISM which lifts the BUMPERS outside 
the BUMPER ZONE (when virtually transposed onto a flat floor). This violates this 
rule.  
R406  *Fill BUMPER  corners.  Corner joints between BUMPERS must be filled with uncompressed padding 
material extending at least 2 ¼ in. (~ 58 mm)  from the corner with no gaps or voids. Examples of 
implementation are shown in Figure 8 -7. 

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 88 of 164 Figure 8-7 Uncompressed corner padding  
   
Examples that do not meet the requirements of R406: 
A. Foam cylinders or sheets bent around a sharp corner (less than 135°) are 
considered compressed . 
B. Separate bumper segments meeting at a miter in the corner are not 
considered to “fill” the corner due to the cloth  covering . 
R407  *BUMPERS  shouldn’t be wedges. BUMPERS must not act as wedges when interacting with other 
BUMPERS . 
Examples of BUMPERS which act as a wedge include:  
A. BUMPERS utilizing softer foam towards the top of a BUMPER 
profile  
B. BUMPERS utilizing excessively rounded profiles such as a single 
semi -circle  
C. BUMPERS with tapered or stepped padding s uch that the padding  
is thinner or thicker towards the top or bottom  
R408  *Weight limit with BUMPERS. The total weight of the ROBOT (as described in R103 ) with BUMPERS 
must not exceed 135 lbs. ( ~61 kg)  
R409  *BUMPERS  shouldn’t move.  BUMPERS  must not be articulated, relative to the ROBOT PERIMETER.  
R410  *BUMPERS  must come off.  BUMPERS  must be designed for installation and removal to facilitate 
inspection and weighing.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 89 of 164 As a guideline, BUMPERS  should be able to be installed or removed by 2 people 
in fewer than 5 minutes.  
R411  *BUMPERS  indicate your ALLIANCE . Each ROBOT  must be able to display red or blue BUMPER  covers  
to reflect their ALLIANCE color, as assigned in the MATCH  schedule distributed at the event (as 
described in section 10.1 MATCH Schedules ). Contrasting m arkings on outward , upward, or downward  
facing surfaces of the BUMPER  cover , other than the following, are prohibited:  
A. those required per R412 ,  
B. hook -and-loop tape, snap fasteners, or functional equivalents backed by the hard parts of the 
BUMPER , 
C. solid white FIRST  logos between 4¾ in. (~12 1 mm) and 5¼ in. wide (~13 3 mm) (i.e. comparable 
to those available in the REEFSCAPE Virtual Kit), and  
D. narrow areas of underlying cloth  exposed at seams, corners, or folds.  
R412  *Team number on BUMPERS . Team numbers must be displayed and positioned on the BUMPER  cover  
such that an observer walking around the perimeter of the ROBOT  can unambiguously tell the team’s 
number from any point of view , from as far as approximately 60 ft. (1  829 cm), and meet the following 
additional criteria:  
A. consist of only white Arabic numerals at least 3 ¾ in. (~ 96 mm ) high, at least ½ in. (~13 mm) in 
stroke width,  
The ½ in. (~13 mm) stroke width requirement applies to the majority of the 
stroke. Font elements less than ½ in. (~13 mm) such as serifs, rounded edges, 
small hairlines or gaps, etc. are permitted as long as the majority of the stroke 
meets the sizing requ irement and the numbers are unambiguous.  
B. must not wrap around sharp corners (less than 135 °) of the ROBOT PERIMETER,  
C. must not split individual digits such that the team number is ambiguous , and 
As a guideline, spacing between digits or groups of digits which exceeds ~4 in. 
(~10 1 mm ) may be ambiguous.  
D. may not substitute logos or icons for numerals.  
There is no prohibition against splitting team numbers onto different sections of 
BUMPER . The intent is that the team’s number is clearly visible and unambiguous 
so that Judges, REFEREES, Announcers, and other teams can easily identify 
competing ROBOTS . 
This marking is intended to display the team number only, not to intentionally 
change the surface characteristics of the BUMPER . Excessive material usage as 
part of any team number marking will invite close scrutiny.

Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 91 of 164 Motor Name  Part Numbers Available  
Fans, no greater than 120mm (nominal) size and rated electrical input power no greater than 10 
watts (W) continuous duty at 12 volts (VDC)   
Hard drive motors part of a legal COTS computing device  
Factory installed vibration and autofocus motors resident in COTS computing devices (e.g. rumble motor in a smartphone).  
PWM COTS rotational  servos with s tall current  ≤ 4A and mechanical output power ≤ 8W at 6V . PWM 
COTS linear servos with max stall current ≤ 1A at 6V . 
Motors integral to a COTS  sensor (e.g. LIDAR, scanning sonar, etc.), provided the device is not 
modified except to facilitate mounting  
1 compressor compliant with R806  and used to compress air for the ROBOT’S  pneumatic system  
COTS linear actuators , electrical solenoid actuators, or electromagnets  rated for 12V and wired 
downstream of a breaker 20A or less . Electrical solenoid actuators or electromagnets used at 24V 
must be rated for 24V.  
For servos, note that the roboRIO is limited to a max current output of 2.2A on 
the 6V rail (12.4W of electrical input power). Teams should make sure that their 
total servo power usage remains below this limit at all times.  
Servo mechanical output power is approximated by the following formula (using 
6V data reported by manufacturer): Mechanical Output Power (in W) = 0.25 x 
(Stall Torque in N -m) x (No Load Speed in rad/s). This calculator from the FIRST 
Tech Challenge documentation  can be used to help calculate output power from 
inputs of various units.  
Given the extensive amount of motors allowed on the ROBOT , teams are 
encouraged to consider the total power available from the ROBOT  battery during 
the design and build of the ROBOT . Drawing large amounts of current from many 
motors at the same time could lead to drops in ROBOT  battery voltage that may 
result in tripping the main breaker or trigger the brownout protection of the 
roboRIO. For more information about the roboRIO brownout protection and 
measuring current draw using the PDP/PDH, see roboRIO Brownout and 
Understanding Current Draw . 
AndyMark PG Gearmotors are sold with labeling based on the entire assembly. 
Assemblies labeled am -3651 through am -3656 contain legal motors specified in 
Table 8 -1. These motors may be used with or without the provided gearbox.  
R502  *Only 4 propulsion motors. A ROBOT may not have more than 4 propulsion motors. A propulsion motor 
is a motor that enables the ROBOT to move around the FIELD surface. Motors that generate small amounts of thrust as a secondary or incidental feature are not considered propulsion motors.  
Examples that are  not considered propulsion motors  include:  
A. motors that primarily alter the alignment of a wheel in contact with the FIELD  
surface (such as a swerve steering motor),  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 92 of 164 B. motors that run MECHANISM wheels (e.g. for CORAL  manipulation) that 
occasionally happen to contact the carpet, but without enough force to 
generate significant thrust, and  
C. motors that change the speed of the drive wheels using a shifting 
MECHANISM  without significantly contributing to propulsion.  
R503  *Don’t modify motors (mostly).  The integral mechanical and electrical system of any motor must not 
be modified. Motors, servos, and electric solenoids used on the ROBOT  shall not be modified in any 
way, except as follows:  
A. The mounting brackets and/or output shaft/interface may be modified to facilitate the physical 
connection of the motor to the ROBOT  and actuated part.  
B. The electrical leads may be trimmed to length as necessary and connectors or splices to additional wiring may be added.  
C. The locking pins on the window motors (P/N 262100 -3030 and 262100- 3040) may be removed.  
D. The connector housings on KOP automotive motors listed in Table 8 -1 may be modified to 
facilitate lead connections.  
E. Servos may be modified as specified by the manufacturer (e.g. re -programming or modification 
for continuous rotation).  
F. The wiring harness of the Nidec Dynamo BLDC Motor may be modified as documented by FIRST  
in Nidec Dynamo BLDC Motor with Controller .  
G. Minimal labeling may be applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity, functional performance, etc.  
H. Any number of #10 -32 plug screws may be removed from the Falcon 500  and the Kraken X60 . 
I. Insulation may be applied to electrical terminals.  
J. Repairs, provided the original performance and specifications are unchanged.  
K. Maintenance recommended by the manufacturer.  
The intent of this rule is to allow teams to modify mounting tabs and the like, not 
to gain a weight reduction by potentially compromising the structural integrity of 
any motor.  
R504  *Power (most) actuators off of approved devices.  With the exception of servos, fans, or motors 
integral to sensors of COTS computing devices permitted in R501 , each actuator must be controlled by 
a power regulating device. The only power regulating devices for actuators permitted on the ROBOT  
include:  
A. motor controllers: a. DMC 60/DMC 60c Motor Controller (P/N 410 -334-1, 410- 334-2),

8.6 Power Distribution  
In order to maintain safety, the rules in this section apply at all times while at the event, not just while the 
ROBOT  is on the FIELD for MATCHES .  
R601  *Battery limit – everyone has the same power. The only legal source of electrical energy for the ROBOT  
during the competition, the ROBOT  battery, must be 1 and only 1 non -spillable sealed lead acid (SLA) 
battery with the following specifications:  
A. Nominal voltage: 12V  
B. Nominal capacity at 20 -hour discharge rate: minimum 17Ah, maximum 18.2Ah  
C. Shape: Rectangular  
D. Nominal Dimensions: 7.1 in. x 3 in. x 6.6 in., +/ - .1 in. for each dimension (~ 180 mm x 76mm x 
168 mm, +/ - 2.5 mm for each dimension)  
E. Nominal weight: 11lbs. to 14.5 lbs. (~5 kg. to 6.5 kg.)  
F. Terminals: Nut and bolt style  
"Nut and bolt style" refers to any style battery terminal where the connector is 
secured to the battery using a threaded fastener.  
Examples of batteries which meet these criteria include:  
A. Enersys (P/N NP18 -12, NP18- 12B, NP18 -12BFR),  
B. MK Battery (P/N ES17 -12), 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 95 of 164 C. Battery Mart (P/N SLA- 12V18),  
D. Sigma (P/N SP12 -18), 
E. Universal Battery (P/N UB12180),  
F. Power Patrol (P/N SLA1116),  
G. Werker Battery (P/N WKA12- 18NB),  
H. Power Sonic (P/N PS -12180NB),  
I. Yuasa (P/N NP18 -12B),  
J. Panasonic (P/N LC -RD-1217),  
K. Interstate Batteries (P/N BSL1116), and  
L. Duracell Ultra Battery (P/N DURA12 -18NB).  
Teams should be aware that they may be asked to provide documentation of the 
specifications of any battery not listed above.  
Batteries should be charged in accordance with manufacturer’s specification. 
(Please see the FIRST  Safety Manual  for additional information.)  
R602  *Other batteries for cameras or computers only. COTS USB battery packs with a capacity of 100Wh or 
less (27000mAh at 3.7V ) with 5V/5A max output or 12V/5A max output using USB -PD per port, 
batteries integral to and part of a COTS computing device or self -contained camera (e.g. laptop 
batteries, GoPro style camera, etc.) , or batteries used to power CMOS/RTC features may be used to 
power COTS computing devices and any peripheral COTS input or output devices connected to the 
COTS computing device provided they are:  
A. securely fastened to the ROBOT , 
B. connected only using unmodified COTS cables, and  
C. charged according to manufacturer recommendations.  
A COTS computing device is a non -roboRIO device used to process or collect 
sensor information (e.g. a “smart flashlight” is not a COTS computing device).  
R603  *Charge batteries with safe connectors.  Any battery charger used to charge a ROBOT  battery must 
have the corresponding Anderson SB connector installed.  
R604  *Charge batteries at a safe rate. Any battery charger used to charge a ROBOT  battery may not be used 
such that it exceeds 6 -Amp average charge current.  
R605  *Batteries are not ballast.  No batteries other than those allowed per R601 and R602 are allowed on the 
ROBOT , whether or not they are being used to supply power.  
For example, teams may not use additional batteries as extra weight on their 
ROBOTS . 
R606  *Secure the battery.  The ROBOT  battery must be secured such that it will not dislodge during vigorous 
ROBOT  interaction including if the ROBOT  is turned over or placed in any arbitrary orientation.  
R607  *Insulate battery connections. Each electrical terminal on the ROBOT  battery, main breaker, and their 
connections (lugs, stripped wire ends, etc.) to the wire must be fully insulated at all times.  
R608  *Limit non -battery energy.  Non-electrical sources of energy used by the ROBOT  (i.e., stored at the start 
of a MATCH ) shall come only from the following sources:  
A. compressed air stored in the pneumatic system that has been charged in compliance with R806 
and R807,  
B. a change in the altitude of the ROBOT  center of gravity,  
C. storage achieved by deformation of ROBOT  parts, 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 96 of 164 D. closed -loop COTS pneumatic (gas) shocks, or  
E. air-filled (pneumatic) wheels.  
R609  *Connect main power safely.  The following devices shall be connected with 6 AWG (7 SWG or 16 
mm2) copper wire or larger as shown in Figure 8 -8:  
A. 1 ROBOT  battery,  
B. a single pair of Anderson Power Products (or APP) 2 -pole SB type connectors,  
C. the 1 main 120 -Amp (120A) surface mount circuit breaker (Cooper Bussman P/N CB185 -120, 
CB185F -120, CB285- 120 CB285F -120, CB285120F or Optifuse P/N 153120, 253120), and  
D. the 1 power distribution device (CTR Electronics Power Distribution Panel, PDP  or PDP 2.0 , P/N 
am-2856, 217- 4244, 14 -806880, 24-806880 or REV Robotics  Power Distribution Hub, PDH, P/N 
REV-11-1850)  
No additional devices or modifications shall be permitted with the following exceptions:  
E. Monitoring circuitry permitted by R625 . 
F. SB-50 to SB -120 adapters, provided they have been presented for Inspection  
G. Termination of wires with appropriate cable lugs 
Figure 8-8 Electrical connection diagram  
 
“SB type” refers to SB type only (e.g. SB -50, SB -120, etc.), not SBS or any other 
part type beginning with SB. All batteries supplied by FIRST (such as Spare Parts 
and international batteries) will have a red or pink SB50 connector installed 
which may not be removed.  
The pink connectors included in the KOP mate with the red SB50 connector.  
R610  *1 breaker/fuse  per circuit. All circuits, with the exceptions of those listed in R615  and R617 , must 
connect to, and have power sourced solely by, a single protected 12VDC WAGO connector pair of the 
PDP /PDP2 .0/PDH, not the M6 cap screws.  
R611  *The ROBOT  frame is not a wire. All wiring and electrical devices shall be electrically isolated from the 
ROBOT  frame. The ROBOT  frame must not be used to carry electrical current.  
Compliance with this rule is checked by observing a >120Ω resistance between 
either the (+) or ( -) post within the APP connector that is attached to the 
PDP /PDP2.0 /PDH and any point on the ROBOT . 
All legal motor controllers with metal cases are electrically isolated. They may be 
mounted directly to ROBOT  frame COMPONENTS.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 97 of 164 Note that some cameras, decorative lights, and sensors (e.g. some encoders, 
some IR sensors, etc.) have grounded enclosures or are manufactured with 
conductive plastics. These devices must be electrically isolated from the ROBOT  
frame to ensure compliance with this rule.  
R612  *Must be able to turn ROBOT  on and off safely.  The 120A circuit breaker must be quickly and safely 
accessible from the exterior of the ROBOT . This is the only 120A circuit breaker allowed on the ROBOT . 
Examples considered not “quickly and safely accessible” include breakers 
covered by an access panel or door, or mounted on, underneath or immediately 
adjacent to moving COMPONENTS.  
It is strongly recommended that the 120A circuit breaker location be clearly and 
obviously labeled so it can be easily found by FIELD STAFF if needed. 
While the main breaker must be accessible, consider  positioning or shielding it 
such that it’s protected from a ccidental actuation (e.g. it’s unlikely to be hit by a 
SCORING ELEMENT  during game play ).  
R613  *Electrical system must be inspectable. The PDP /PDP2.0/PDH, associated wiring, and all circuit 
breakers must be visible for inspection.  
“Visible for inspection” does not require that the items be visible when the 
ROBOT  is in STARTING CONFIGURATION, provided the team can make the items 
viewable during the inspection process.  
R614  *No high voltage allowed.  Any active electrical item that is not an actuator (specified in R501) or core 
control system item (specified in  R710 ) is considered a CUSTOM CIRCUIT. CUSTOM CIRCUITS shall 
not produce measurable voltages exceeding 24V  with the exception of COTS Power -over -Ethernet 
(PoE) injector devices used with COTS Ethernet cables and COTS receiving devices (i.e. not a breakout 
or adapter) . 
R615  *Power roboRIO as specified.  The roboRIO power input must be connected to either:  
A. the dedicated supply terminals on the PDP shown in Figure 8 -9 or  
Figure 8-9 roboRIO power source on a PDP  
 
B. the terminals of 1 of the non- switchable fused channels on the PDH (20,21,22) with a 10A fuse 
or circuit breaker installed in the associated fuse holder , or 

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 98 of 164 Figure 8-10 roboRIO power source on a PDH  
 
C. directly to the terminals of  any single  channel on the PDP 2.0 with a 10A fuse or circuit breaker 
installed in the associated fuse holder.  
Figure 8-11 roboRIO power source on a PDP 2.0 
 
R616  *Power radio as specified – Part 1.  The wireless bridge (radio) power must be supplied by either:  
A. the 12V 2A output of a CTR Electronics Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) (P/N am -2857, 217 -
4245), as shown in Figure 8 -12, and must be the only load connected to those terminals or  
Figure 8-12 Radio power source from a VRM  
 
B. using an Ethernet cable between a REV Radio Power Module  (RPM) (P/N REV -11-1856) and the 
“RIO” Ethernet port on the wireless bridge  (or the 18-24v P oE port for events using OM5P 
radios) , or   

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 99 of 164 C. directly from the PDP /PDP2.0/PDH ports described in R617  (this option is not permitted for 
OM5P radios)   
Note that this prohibits using any other active P oE injector device to 
power the radio but does not prohibit using any PASSIVE CONDUCTORS 
to inject the VRM  or direct PDP/ PDP2.0/PDH  power into an Ethernet 
cable plugged into the radio port labeled “ RIO.” 
The use of a VRM or RPM to power the VH -109 radio is permitted in 2025 
to allow transition to the new radio. In 2026 the radio will be required to 
be wired directly to the PDP/ PDP2.0/PDH.  
R617  *Power radio as specified – Part 2. The device supplying power to the wireless bridge per R616  must 
be connected to either:  
A. the designated supply terminals at the end of the PDP, as shown in Figure 8 -13. With the 
exception of a single CTR Electronics Pneumatics Control Module (PCM, P/N am -2858) or REV 
Robotics  Pneumatic Hub (PH, P/N REV- 11-1852), no other electrical load shall be connected to 
these PDP terminals , 
Figure 8-13 VRM, PCM, RPM , and Radio  power source on a PDP  
 
B. the terminals of the non- switchable fused channels on the PDH (20,21,22) with a 10A fuse or 
circuit breaker installed in the associated fuse holder. No other electrical load shall be 
connected to that channel , or 
Figure 8-14 VRM /RPM /Radio  power source on a PDH  
 
C. directly to the terminals of a ny channel on the PDP 2.0 with a 10A fuse  or circuit breaker 
installed in the associated fuse holder.

Please reference  How to Wire an FRC Robot  for wireless bridge wiring 
information.  
R618  *Use PDP/ PDP2.0/ PDH terminals as designed.  Only 1 wire shall be connected to each terminal on the 
PDP/PDP2.0/ PDH.  
If multi -point distribution of circuit power is needed (e.g. to provide power to 
multiple PCMs and/or VRMs from 1 20A circuit), then all incoming wires may be 
appropriately spliced into the main lead (e.g. using an insulated terminal block, 
crimped splice or soldered wire splice), and the single main lead inserted into the 
terminal to power the circuit.  
R619  *Only use specified circuit breakers in PDP/ PDP2.0/ PDH.  The only circuit breakers permitted for use in 
the PDP/ PDP2.0/PDH are:  
A. Snap Action VB3 -A Series or AT2 -A, terminal style F57, 40A rating or lower,  
B. Snap Action MX5 -A or MX5 -L Series, 40A rating or lower,  
C. REV Robotics  ATO auto -resetting breakers 40A rating or lower , 
D. Any ATM circuit breaker with value less than or equal to the fuses permitted per R620.  
R620  *Only use specified fuses in PDP/ PDP2.0/ PDH.  The only fuses permitted for use in the 
PDP/PDP2.0/ PDH are automotive blade fuses with the following values:  
A. for the PDP, ATM style fuses with values matching the value printed on the device’s 
corresponding fuse holder , 
B. for the PDP 2.0, ATC/ATO  style  fuses with values 10A or lower,  and 
C. for the PDH, ATM style fuses with values 15A or lower with the exception of a single 20A fuse 
for powering a PCM or PH.  
Note that these fuses must be pressed very firmly to seat properly. Improper 
seating can cause a device to reboot upon impact.  
R621  *Protect circuits with appropriate circuit breakers. Each branch circuit must be protected by 1 and only 
1 circuit breaker or fuse on the PDP/ PDP2.0/ PDH per Table 8 -3. No other electrical load can be 
connected to the breaker or fuse supplying this circuit  with the exception of devices downstream of a 
Kraken X60 Powerpole adapter board (WCP -1380, RF-4003 ).

(29 SWG or .08 mm2)  
Wires that are recommended by the device manufacturer or originally attached to legal devices are considered part of the device and by default legal. Such wires are exempt from this rule , provided they 
are powered by the smallest value fuse or breaker which permits proper device operation.  
In order to show compliance with these rules, teams should use wire with clearly 
labeled sizes if possible. If unlabeled wiring is used, teams should be prepared to 
demonstrate that the wire used meets the requirements of this rule (e.g. wire 
samples and e vidence that they are the required size).  
R623  *Use only appropriate connectors. Branch circuits may include intermediate elements such as COTS 
connectors, splices, COTS flexible/rolling/sliding contacts, and COTS slip rings , as long as the entire 
electrical pathway is via appropriately gauged/rated elements.  
Slip rings containing mercury are prohibited per R203. 
R624  *Use specified wire colors (mostly).  All non -SIGNAL LEVEL wiring with a constant polarity (i.e., except 
for outputs of relay modules, motor controllers, or sensors) shall be color -coded along their entire 
length from the manufacturer as follows:  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 103 of 164 A. red, yellow, white, brown, or black -with -stripe on the positive (e.g. +24VDC, +12VDC, +5VDC, 
etc.) connections  
B. black or blue for the common or negative side ( -) of the connections  
Exceptions to this rule include:  
C. wires that are originally attached to legal devices and any extensions to these wires using the 
same color as the manufacturer  
D. Ethernet cable used in P oE cables  
R625  *Don’t modify critical power paths.  CUSTOM CIRCUITS shall not directly alter the power pathways 
between the ROBOT  battery, PDP/ PDP2.0/PDH, motor controllers, relays (per R504 -B), motors and 
actuators (per R501), pneumatic solenoid valves, or other elements of the ROBOT  control system 
(items explicitly mentioned in R710). Custom high impedance voltage monitoring or low impedance 
current monitoring circuitry connected to the ROBOT ’S electrical system is acceptable, if the effect on 
the ROBOT  outputs is inconsequential.  
A noise filter may be wired across motor leads or PWM leads. Such filters will not 
be considered CUSTOM CIRCUITS and violate neither this rule nor  R712. 
Acceptable signal filters must be fully insulated and must be 1 of the following:  
−  1 microfarad (1 µF) or less, non -polarized, capacitor may be applied across 
the power leads of any motor on your ROBOT  (as close to the actual motor 
leads as reasonably possible) or  
− a resistor may be used as a shunt load for the PWM control signal feeding a 
servo.  
R626  *VH-109 PoE passthrough.  The VH -109 PoE output may be used only under the following conditions:  
A. The device being powered is a COTS device or COTS adapter connected to a single COTS device with current draw ≤ 2A at 12V.  
B. The connection is made using standard Cat5e/6/7/8 cable.  
C. The VH -109 is powered using the 12V input terminals with 18AWG wire or larger (it may 
additionally be powered using the PoE input if desired).  
8.7 Control, Command & Signals System  
R701  *Control the ROBOT  with a roboRIO. ROBOTS  must be controlled via 1 programmable NI roboRIO or 
roboRIO 2.0 (P/N am3000 or am3000a, both versions referred to throughout this manual as “roboRIO”), with image version 2025_v2.0 or later.  
There are no rules that prohibit co -processors, provided commands originate 
from the roboRIO to enable and disable all power regulating devices. This 
includes motor controllers legally wired to the CAN bus.  
R702  *Communicate with the ROBOT  with the specified radio. 1 Vivid Hosting wireless bridge (P/N: VH-109), 
that has been configured with the appropriate encryption key for your team number at each event, is the only permitted device for communicating to and from the ROBOT  during the MATCH . Events held in 
China and Chinese Taipei are the exception s to this rule and must use an OpenMesh (P/N: OM5P -AN or 
OM5P -AC) radio.  
R703  *Use specific Ethernet port for roboRIO. The roboRIO Ethernet port must be connected to  either  
A. the wireless bridge port labeled “18 -24v P oE” for OpenMesh radios  (either directly, via a 
network switch, via an RPM, or via a C at5 Ethernet pigtail) . 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 104 of 164 B. the port labeled “RIO” of a VH -109 radio via (either directly, or via a Cat5 Ethernet pigtail)  an 
RPM, passive PoE injector cable or adapter (whether or not it is used to power the radio), or 
an Ethernet cable with the appropriate wires removed on the roboRIO end. All wires or adapters used must be fully insulated.  
C. the port labeled “AUX 1” or “AUX 2” of a VH- 109 radio with the corresponding DIP switch in 
the off (default) position  (either directly, or via a Cat5 Ethernet pigtail).  
Note: Placing a switch between the roboRIO and radio may impede the ability for 
FIELD STAFF to troubleshoot roboRIO connection issues on the FIELD. Teams 
may be asked to connect directly between the radio and the roboRIO as part of 
troubleshooting efforts.   
If not using the “RIO” port of the VH -109, it is strongly recommended to cover the 
port to prevent accidental damage to devices such as laptops which may occur if 
attached to this port.  
R704  *Only use allowed ports and bandwidth to communicate with the ROBOT . Communication between the 
ROBOT  and the OPERATOR CONSOLE may not exceed  the following and is restricted to network ports 
listed in Table 8 -5: 
A. 7 Mbits/second  for Vivid Hosting wireless bridge radios  
B. 4 Mbits/second  for OpenMesh radios  
Table 8-5 Open FMS ports  
Port  Designation  Bi-directional?  
UDP/TCP 1180-1190  Camera data from the roboRIO to dashboard software when the camera is connected the roboRIO via USB  Yes 
TCP 1735  SmartDashboard  Yes 
UDP 1130  Dashboard- to-ROBOT  control data  Yes 
UDP 1140  ROBOT -to-Dashboard status data  Yes 
HTTP 80  Camera connected via switch on the ROBOT  Yes

UDP/TCP 1250  CTRE Diagnostics Server  Yes 
UDP/TCP 5800-
5810  Team use Yes 
Teams may use these ports as they wish if they do not employ them as outlined above (i.e. TCP 1180 can be used to pass data back and forth between the ROBOT  and the Driver Station Software if the 
team chooses not to use the camera on USB).  
Note that the 4 Mbit limit will be strictly enforced by the wireless bridge.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 105 of 164 The FMS Whitepaper  has more details on how to check and optimize bandwidth 
usage.  
While FIRST  makes every effort to provide a wireless environment that allows 
teams access to a full 4 Mbits/second data rate (with about 100 Kbit used for 
ROBOT  control and status), at some events wireless conditions may not 
accommodate this.  
R705  *Configure devices for your team number. The roboRIO, Driver Station Software, and wireless bridge 
must be configured to correspond to the correct team number, per the procedures defined in the FIRST  
Robot ics Competition Control System documentation . 
R706  *Don’t bypass the ARENA  network. All signals must originate from the OPERATOR CONSOLE and be 
transmitted to the ROBOT  via the ARENA  Ethernet network.  
R707  *Limited  wireless allowed. The only forms of  wireless communication that may be used to 
communicate to, from, or within the ROBOT , include:  
A. those required per R702  and R706  
B. tags used  for location detection systems if provided by the event  
C. RFID or NFC systems used exclusively within the ROBOT  
Devices that employ signals in the visual spectrum (e.g. cameras) and non -RF 
sensors that don’t receive human- originated commands (e.g. “beam break” 
sensors or IR sensors on the ROBOT  used to detect FIELD elements) are not 
wireless communication devices and thus this rule doesn’t apply.  
R708  *Wireless bridge must be visible. The wireless bridge must be mounted on the ROBOT  such that the 
diagnostic lights are visible to FIELD STAFF.  
Teams are encouraged to mount the wireless bridge away from noise generating 
devices such as motors, PCM(s)/PH(s), and VRM(s)/RPM(s).  
R709  *ROBOTS  must have a signal light. ROBOTS  must use at least 1, but no more than 2, diagnostic ROBOT  
Signal Light (RSL) (P/N 855PB -B12ME522 and/or am -3583).  
Any RSL must be:  
A. mounted on the ROBOT  such that it is easily visible while standing 3 ft. (~ 100 cm) away 
from at least one side of the ROBOT , 
B. connected to the “RSL” supply terminals on the roboRIO, and  
C. if using the 855PB -B12ME522, wired for solid light operation, by placing a jumper 
between the “La” and “Lb” terminals on the light per Figure 8 -16.  
Please see How to Wire an FRC ROBOT  for connection details.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 106 of 164 Figure 8-16 855PB -B12ME522 jumper wiring  
 
R710  *Only specified modifications to control system devices permitted. The Driver Station Software, 
roboRIO, PDP/PDP2.0/ PDH, PCM(s)/PH(s), VRM(s)/RPM(s), RSL, 120A breaker, motor controllers, MXP 
devices used to control actuators per R713- C, relay modules (per R504 -B), wireless bridge, 
PDP /PDP2.0/PDH breakers and fuses, Servo Power Module, Servo Hub, Kraken Powerpole adapter boards,  
and batteries shall not be tampered with, modified, or adjusted in any way (tampering includes drilling, 
cutting, machining, rewiring, disassembling, painting, etc.), with the following exceptions:  
Please note that the Driver Station Software is a separate application from the 
Dashboard. The Driver Station Software may not be modified, while teams are 
expected to customize their Dashboard code.  
A. User programmable code in the roboRIO may be customized.  
B. Motor controllers may be calibrated as described in owner's manuals.  
C. Fans may be attached to motor controllers and may be powered from the power input terminals.  
D. If powering the compressor, the fuse on a Spike H- Bridge Relay may be replaced with a 
VB3A -20A Snap -Action circuit breaker.  
E. Wires, cables, and signal lines may be connected via the standard connection points provided on the devices.  
F. Fasteners (including adhesives) may be used to attach the device to the OPERATOR CONSOLE or ROBOT  or to secure cables to the device.  
G. Thermal interface material may be used to improve heat conduction.  
H. Labeling may be applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity, functional performance, etc.  
I. Jumpers may be changed from their default location.  
J. Limit switch jumpers may be removed from a Jaguar motor controller and a custom limit switch circuit may be substituted.  
K. Device firmware may be updated with manufacturer supplied firmware.  
L. Integral wires on motor controllers may be cut, stripped, and/or connectorized.  
M. Devices may be repaired, provided the performance and specifications of the device 
after the repair are identical to those before the repair.  
N. The cover may be removed from the Talon SRX or Talon FX data port.  
O. Electrical tape may be applied to the aluminum plate inside the wireless bridge.  
P. The input terminal cover from the PDP may be omitted (no other element may be 
installed using the threaded holes to install something in place of the PDP terminal cover).  
Q. The roboRIO 2.0 SD card may be replaced with an SD card of any capacity.  
R. adding insulating material to exposed conductors.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 107 of 164 S. replacing  control system  power terminal  blocks  (e.g. RSL power connector) with 
functional equivalents 
T. tape may be applied for debris protection.  
Please note that while repairs are permitted, the allowance is independent of any 
manufacturer’s warranty. Teams make repairs at their own risk and should 
assume that any warranty or return options are forfeited. Be aware that 
diagnosing and repairing COMPONENTS such as these can be difficult.  
For more information about modification O, please see this OM5P -AC Radio 
Modification article .  
R711  *Don’t connect motor outputs to roboRIO.  Neither 12VDC power nor relay module or motor controller 
outputs shall be directly connected to the roboRIO, with the exception of the designated 12VDC input.  
R712  *Control PWM controllers from the roboRIO.  Every relay module (per R504 -B), servo,  Servo Power 
Module , and PWM motor controller shall be connected to a corresponding port (relays to Relay ports, 
serv os, and PWM controllers to PWM ports) on the roboRIO (either directly or through a WCP Spartan 
Sensor Board) or via a legal MXP connection (per R713). They shall not be controlled by signals from any 
other source, with the exception of the Nidec Dynamo motor controller which must also be connected to 
the roboRIO Digital I/O.  
R713  *Only approved MXP devices can control actuators.  If a motor is controlled via the MXP, its power 
regulating device must be connected by 1 of the following methods:  
A. directly to any PWM pins,  
B. via a network of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS used to extend the PWM pins, or  
C. via 1 approved ACTIVE DEVICE:  
a. Kauai Labs navX MXP  
b. Kauai Labs navX2 MXP  
c. RCAL MXP Daughterboard  
d. REV Robotics  RIOduino  
e. REV Robotics Digit Board  
f. West Coast Products Spartan Sensor Board  
g. Huskie Robotics HUSKIE 2.0 Board  
A PASSIVE CONDUCTOR is any device or circuit whose capability is limited to the 
conduction and/or static regulation of the electrical energy applied to it (e.g. wire, 
splices, connectors, printed wiring board, etc.).  
An ACTIVE DEVICE is any device capable of dynamically controlling and/or 
converting a source of electrical energy by the application of external electrical 
stimulus.  
The “network of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS” only applies to the pins being used for 
PWM output to motors or servos. This means that connecting an ACTIVE 
DEVICE, such as a sensor to 1 MXP pin does not prevent other MXP pins from 
being used in accordance with B. 
R714  *Control CAN motor controllers from the roboRIO.  Each CAN motor controller must be controlled with 
enable/disable inputs sourced from the roboRIO and passed via either a PWM (wired per R713) or CAN bus 
(either directly or daisy -chained via another CAN bus device) signal, but both shall not be wired 
simultaneously on the same device.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 108 of 164 As long as the CAN bus is wired legally so that the heartbeat from the roboRIO is 
maintained, all closed loop control features of the CAN motor controller may be 
used. (That is, commands originating from the roboRIO to configure, enable, and 
specify an ope rating point for all CAN motor controller closed loop modes fit the 
intent of  R701). 
“Wired directly” includes via any series of PASSIVE CONDUCTORS (i.e. star or 
hub configurations using only PASSIVE CONDUCTORS are permitted.)  
R715  *Control PCM , PH, and Servo Hub  from roboRIO.  Each PCM , PH, and Servo Hub  must be controlled 
with signal inputs sourced from the roboRIO and passed via a CAN bus connection from the built -in CAN 
on the roboRIO (either directly or daisy -chained via another CAN bus device).  
R716  *Don’t alter the CAN bus.  No device that interferes with, alters, or blocks communications among the 
roboRIO and the PDP/PDH, PCMs/PHs, and/or CAN motor controllers on the bus will be permitted.  
Only 1 wire should be inserted into each Weidmuller CAN connector terminal. For 
documentation on how to wire the CAN bus connections see How to Wire an FRC 
ROBOT . 
R717  *USB to CAN adapter permitted. Additional CAN bus connections may be added to the roboRIO using 
the CTR Electronics CANivoreTM (P/N 21 -678682, WCP- 1522 ) USB -to-CAN adapter.  
Any additional CAN bus added in this manner satisfies the requirements of R714  
(i.e. you may connect motor controllers to this additional bus).  
8.8 Pneumatic System  
In order to maintain safety, the rules in this section apply at all times while at the event, not just while the 
ROBOT  is on the FIELD for MATCHES .  
R801  *Only use explicitly permitted pneumatic parts.  To satisfy multiple constraints associated with safety, 
consistency, inspection, and constructive innovation, no pneumatic parts other than those explicitly permitted in this section shall be used on the ROBOT . 
R802  *No custom pneumatics and meet minimum pressure ratings.  All pneumatic items must be COTS 
pneumatic devices and either:  
A. rated by their manufacturers for pressure of at least 125psi (~862 kPa , 8.6 Bar ), or 
B. installed downstream of the primary relieving regulator (see R809 ), and rated for pressure of at 
least 70psi (~483 kPa, 4.8 Bar ) 
Any pressure specification such as “working,” “operating,” “maximum,” etc. may 
be used to satisfy the requirements of this rule.  
It is recommended that all pneumatic items be rated by their manufacturers for a 
working pressure of at least 60 psi (~414 kPa , 4.1 Bar). 
R803  *Don’t modify pneumatics.  All pneumatic COMPONENTS must be used in their original, unaltered 
condition. Exceptions are as follows:  
A. tubing may be cut,  
B. wiring for pneumatic devices may be modified to interface with the control system,  
C. assembling and connecting pneumatic COMPONENTS using the pre -existing threads, mounting 
brackets, quick -connect fittings, etc.,  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 109 of 164 D. removing the mounting pin from a pneumatic cylinder, provided the cylinder itself is not 
modified, and  
E. labeling applied to indicate device purpose, connectivity, functional performance, etc.  
Do not, for example, paint, file, machine, or abrasively remove any part of a 
pneumatic COMPONENT – this would cause the part to become a prohibited 
item.  
R804  *Only use specific pneumatic devices. The only pneumatic system items permitted on ROBOTS  include 
the following items:  
A. pneumatic pressure vent plug valves functionally equivalent to those provided in the KOP,  
Examples of acceptable valves include Parker PV609 -2 or MV709- 2. 
B. pressure relief valves functionally equivalent to those provided in the KOP,  
Examples of acceptable valves include Norgren 16 -004-011, 16 -004-003 or 
McMaster- Carr 48435K714.  
To be considered functionally equivalent the valve must be preset or adjustable 
to 125 psi (~862 kPA , 8.6 Bar ) and capable of relieving at least 1 scfm (~472 
cm3/s). 
C. solenoid valves with a maximum ⅛ in. (nominal, ~3 mm) NPT, BSPP, or BSPT port diameter or integrated quick connect ¼ in. (nominal, ~6mm) outside diameter tubing connection,  
D. additional pneumatic tubing, with a maximum ¼ in. (nominal, ~6 mm) outside diameter,  
E. pressure transducers, pressure gauges, passive flow control valves (specifically “needle valve”), manifolds, and connecting fittings (including COTS pneumatic U -tubes),  
F. check and quick exhaust valves, provided that the requirements of R813  are still met.  
G. shutoff valves which relieve downstream pressure to atmosphere when closed (may also be known as 3 -way or 3 -way exhausting valves),  
H. pressure regulators with the maximum outlet pressure adjusted to no more than 60 psi (~413 kPa, 4.1 Bar), 
I. pneumatic cylinders, pneumatic linear actuators, and rotary actuators,  
J. pneumatic storage tanks (with the exception of white Clippard tanks P/N AVT -PP-41), 
K. 1 compressor that is compliant with R806 ,  
L. debris or coalescing (water) filters, and  
M. Venturi valves (note: the high -pressure side of a Venturi valve is considered a pneumatic device 
and must follow all pneumatic rules. The vacuum side of a Venturi valve is exempt from the pneumatic rules per “a” in the blue box below).  
The following devices are not considered pneumatic devices and are not subject 
to pneumatic rules (though they must satisfy all other rules):  
A. a device that creates a vacuum,  
B. closed -loop COTS pneumatic (gas) shocks,  
C. air-filled (pneumatic) wheels, and  
D. pneumatic devices not used as part of a pneumatic system (i.e. used in a way 
that does not allow them to contain pressurized air)  
R805  *If using pneumatics, these parts are required.  If pneumatic COMPONENTS are used, the following 
items are required as part of the pneumatic circuit and must be used in accordance with this section, as illustrated in Figure 8 -17. 
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 110 of 164 A. 1 FIRST Robotics Competition legal compressor (per R806),  
B. a pressure relief valve (per R804 -B) connected and calibrated (per R811),  
C. a Nason pressure switch (P/N SM -2B-115R/443) and/or REV Robotics Analog Pressure Sensor 
(P/N REV -11-1107) connected and wired per R812 , 
D. at least 1 pressure vent plug plumbed (per R813 ), 
E. stored pressure gauge and working pressure gauge (per R810 ), and  
F. 1 primary working pressure regulator (per R808 ). 
Figure 8-17 Pneumatic circuitry  
 
R806  *Compressed air from ROBOT  compressor only.  Throughout an event, compressed air on the ROBOT  
must be provided by its 1 onboard compressor only. Compressor specifications must not exceed nominal 
1.1 cfm (~519 cm3/s) flow rate @ 12VDC at any pressure.  
A ROBOT ’S compressor may be substituted by another compressor, but a ROBOT  
may only have 1 designated compressor at a time, and all compressed air on the 
ROBOT  must be sourced from a single compressor.  
Note: Viair C -series compressors, which have a max working pressure of 120 PSI, 
are rated for intermittent pressures greater than 125 PSI and therefore meet the 
requirements of this rule.  
R807  *Air storage pressure limit. Stored air pressure on the ROBOT  must be no greater than 120 psi (~827 
kPa, 8.2 Bar). No stored air pressure intended for the ROBOT  may be located off- board the ROBOT . 
R808  *Working air pressure limit. Working air pressure (air pressure used to actuate devices) on the ROBOT  
must be no greater than 60 psi (~413 kPa , 4.1 Bar) and must be provided through a single primary 
adjustable, relieving, pressure regulator.  Additional regulators may be located downstream of the single 
primary regulator.  

 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 111 of 164 Examples of acceptable valves include Norgren regulator P/N R07 -100-RNEA and 
Monnier P/N 101 -3002- 1. 
R809  *Limited devices at high pressure. Only the compressor, relief valve, pressure switch, pressure vent 
plug, pressure gauge, storage tanks, tubing, pressure transducers, filters, and connecting fittings may 
be in the high -pressure pneumatic circuit upstream from the regulator.  
It is recommended that all COMPONENTS in the high- pressure pneumatic circuit 
upstream from the regulator be rated for at least 115 psi (~793 kPa , 7.9 Bar ) 
working pressure.  
R810  *Pressure gauges must be visible. Pressure gauges must be placed in easily visible locations 
upstream and downstream of the regulator to display the stored and working pressures, respectively. 
Pressure gauges must show pressure in psi , kPa, or Bar . 
R811  *Relief valve requirements. The relief valve must be attached directly to the compressor or attached by 
legal hard fittings (e.g. brass, nylon, etc.) connected to the compressor output port.  
Teams are required to check and/or adjust the relief valve to release air at 125 psi (~86 2 kPa, 7.9 Bar ). 
The valve may or may not have been calibrated prior to being supplied to teams.  
Instructions for adjusting the pressure relief valve can be found in the 
Pneumatics Manual . 
R812  *Pressure switch requirements. The pressure switch must be connected to the high -pressure side of 
the pneumatic circuit (i.e. prior to the pressure regulator) to sense the stored pressure of the circuit.  
It must be either:  
A. Nason P/N SM -2B-115R/443 (wired as described) and/or  
The 2 wires from the pressure switch must be connected directly to the pressure switch input of 
the PCM/PH controlling the compressor or, if controlled using the roboRIO and a relay, to the roboRIO. If connected to the roboRIO, the roboRIO must be programm ed to sense the state of 
the switch and operate the relay module that powers the compressor to prevent over -pressuring 
the system.  
B. REV Robotics P/N REV -11-1107 (wired as described)  
The analog output of the sensor must be connected directly to analog input 0 of the PH (with 
firmware version 22.0.2 or newer) controlling the compressor.  
The REV Robotics Analog Pressure Sensor may only be used with PH 
compressor control and may not be used with PCM compressor control.  
R813  *Vent plug requirements.  Any pressure vent plug must be:  
A. connected to the pneumatic circuit such that, when manually operated, it will vent to the 
atmosphere to relieve all stored pressure in a reasonable amount of time and  
B. placed on the ROBOT  so that it is visible and easily accessible.  
R814  *Don’t connect solenoid outputs together.  The output  air from multiple solenoid valves must not be 
combined .  
Manifolds, shuttle valves, and other devices which do not combine output airflow, 
even though it may be plumbed into the same device, are not violations of this 
rule.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 112 of 164 8.9 OPERATOR CONSOLE  
R901  *Use the specified Driver Station Software.  The Driver Station Software provided by National 
Instruments ( install instructions found here ) is the only application permitted to specify and 
communicate the operating mode (i.e. AUTO /TELEOP) and operating state (Enable/Disable) to the 
ROBOT . The Driver Station Software must be version 25.0 or newer.  
Teams are permitted to use a portable computing device of their choice (laptop 
computer, tablet, etc.) to host the Driver Station Software while participating in 
MATCHES .  
R902  *The OPERATOR CONSOLE must have a visible display.  The OPERATOR CONSOLE, the set of 
COMPONENTS and MECHANISMS used by the DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS to relay commands 
to the ROBOT , must include a graphic display to present the Driver Station Software diagnostic 
information. It must be positioned within the OPERATOR CONSOLE so that the screen display can be clearly seen during inspection and in a MATCH .  
R903  *Connect FMS Ethernet directly to the OPERATOR CONSOLE. Devices hosting the Driver Station 
Software must only interface with the FMS via the Ethernet cable provided at the DRIVER STATION (e.g. not through a switch). Teams may connect the FMS Ethernet cable to the device running the Driver Station Software dire ctly via an Ethernet pigtail, or with a single -port Ethernet converter (e.g. docking 
station, USB -Ethernet converter, Thunderbolt -Ethernet converter, etc.). The Ethernet port on the 
OPERATOR CONSOLE mu st be easily and quickly accessible.  
Teams are strongly encouraged to use pigtails on the Ethernet port used to 
connect to the FMS. Such pigtails will reduce wear and tear on the device’s port 
and, with proper strain relief employed, will protect the port from accidental 
damage.  
R904  *OPERATOR CONSOLE physical requirements.  The OPERATOR CONSOLE must not  
A. be longer than 5 ft. (~152 cm),  
B. be deeper than 1 ft. 2 in. (~35 cm) (excluding any items that are held or worn by the DRIVERS during the MATCH ), 
C. extend more than 6 ft. 6 in. (~198 cm) above the floor, or  
D. attach to the FIELD (except via the loop tape as described in section  5.6.1  DRIVER STATIONS ). 
There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook -and-loop 
tape (“loop” side) along the center of the DRIVER STATION support shelf that 
should be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf. See section 
5.6.1  DRIVER STATIONS  for details.  
Please note that while there is no hard weight limit, OPERATOR CONSOLES that 
weigh more than 30 lbs. (~13 kg.) will invite extra scrutiny as they are likely to 
present unsafe circumstances.  
R905  *FIELD wireless only. Other than the system provided by the FIELD, no other form of wireless 
communications shall be used to communicate to, from, or within the OPERATOR CONSOLE.  
Examples of prohibited wireless systems include, but are not limited to, active 
wireless network cards and Bluetooth devices. For the case of the FIRST 
Robotics Competition, a motion sensing input device (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) is 
not considered wireless communication and is allowed.  
 
Section 8 ROBOT Construction Rules (R)  V11 113 of 164 R906  *No unsafe OPERATOR CONSOLES. OPERATOR CONSOLES shall not be made using hazardous 
materials, be unsafe, cause an unsafe condition, or interfere with other DRIVE TEAMS or the operation 
of other ROBOTS . 
R907  *No AC inverters.  OPERATOR CONSOLES must not contain AC inverters.  


 
Section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)  V2 115 of 164 9 Inspection & Eligibility  (I) 
This section describes the rules governing MATCH  participation. A team has participated in a MATCH  if any 
member of their DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA  or PROCESSOR AREA , with or without the ROBOT  on 
the FIELD, at the start of the MATCH . 
At each event, the Lead ROBOT  INSPECTOR (LRI) has final authority on the legality of any COMPONENT, 
MECHANISM, or ROBOT . The LRI may consult with additional sources including the Global  LRIs and/or FIRST  
personnel before making their final decision. INSPECTORS may re -inspect ROBOTS  at any time to ensure 
compliance with the rules. Teams are encouraged to consult with INSPECTORS or the LRI if they have any 
questions regarding the legality of a ROBOT  or about how to make a ROBOT  legal.  
The inspection process may progress in blocks, i.e. it may pause for a team’s Practice MATCH , lunch break, 
etc. The process may employ various INSPECTORS throughout the process based on availability. At the team’s discretion, they may request a different INSPECTOR or invite the Lead ROBOT  INSPECTOR to participate in 
their ROBOT ’S inspection.  
While there is no specific defined procedure in place for teams to be re -inspected prior to Playoff MATCHES , it 
is typical for INSPECTORS to use the re -inspection discretion described above to do a limited re -inspection on 
all ROBOTS  near the end of QUALIFICATIONS or beginning of Playoff MATCHES  to help identify any 
modifications that should be re -inspected per I104 . 
ROBOTS  are permitted to participate in scheduled Practice MATCHES  prior to passing inspection. However, 
the FTA, LRI, or Head REFEREE may determine at any time that the ROBOT  is unsafe and may prohibit further 
participation in Practice MATCHES  until the condition is corrected and/or the ROBOT  passes inspection.  A 
safe ROBOT has functional  BUMPERS that approximately meet the required coverage ( R401 ), height ( R402), 
and cross section ( R408) requirements.  
Prior to the start of a MATCH , any ROBOT  which is unable or ineligible to participate in that MATCH , as 
determined by the FTA, LRI, or Head REFEREE, is declared to be BYPASSED  and is DISABLED. A team whose 
ROBOT  is BYPASSED  remains eligible to receive Qualification Ranking Points or Playoff MATCH  points 
provided that its ROBOT  has passed inspection, per I102 .  
An Inspection Checklist  is available to help teams self -inspect their ROBOT  
before their event. Teams are strongly encouraged to self -inspect prior to their 
event.  
9.1 Rules  
I101 *It’s your team’s ROBOT . The ROBOT  and its MAJOR  MECHANISMS must be built by the FIRST  
Robotics Competition team.  
A MAJOR MECHANISM is a group of COMPONENTS and/or MECHANISMS assembled together to address at least 1 game challenge: ROBOT  movement, SCORING ELEMENT  manipulation, FIELD 
element manipulation, or performance of a scorable task without the assistance of another ROBOT.  
This rule requires that the ROBOT  and its MAJOR MECHANISMS were built by its 
team, but isn’t intended to prohibit or discourage assistance from other teams 
(e.g. fabricating elements, supporting construction, writing software, developing 
game strategy, contributing COMPONENTS and/or MECHA NISMS, etc.)  
Examples of MAJOR MECHANISMS include, but are not limited to, assemblies 
used to:  
 
Section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)  V2 116 of 164 A. manipulate SCORING ELEMENTS , 
B. manipulate a FIELD element, and  
C. move the ROBOT  around the FIELD.  
Examples that would generally not be considered MAJOR MECHANISMS, and  
thus probably aren’t subject to this rule include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
A. a gearbox assembly,  
B. a COMPONENT or MECHANISM that’s part of a MAJOR MECHANISM, and  
C. COTS items.  
Neither this rule nor the language in this blue box define specific thresholds for 
how much of a MAJOR MECHANISM must be the result of the team’s effort. This 
rule expects and requires the team’s honest assessment of whether they built the 
MAJOR MECHANISMS  of their ROBOT.  
Attempts to exploit loopholes in the definition of MAJOR MECHANISM in order to 
bypass this requirement are in the spirit of neither this rule nor the FIRST  
Robotics Competition. Examples of exploitation include:  
A. assembling pieces of a MAJOR MECHANISM provided by another team, 
except COTS kits and  
B. receiving a mostly complete MAJOR MECHANISM from another team and 
providing a small piece.  
I102 *Get inspected before playing a Qualification/Playoff MATCH.  A team is only permitted to participate 
in a Qualification or Playoff MATCH and receive Ranking or MATCH Points if their  ROBOT has passed an 
initial, complete inspection.  
Violation: If prior to the start of the MATCH, the team is DISQUALIFIED and not eligible to  participate in the 
MATCH. If after the MATCH, the team  receives a RED  CARD and the MATCH may be replayed per T201 .  
I103 *Bring it all to inspection.  At the time of inspection, the OPERATOR CONSOLE and the ROBOT  must be 
presented with all MECHANISMS (including all COMPONENTS of each MECHANISM), configurations, and 
decorations that will be used on the ROBOT  in MATCHES  without re -inspection (per I104 ) and may not 
exceed 150 lbs. (~68 kg) (note that while up to 150 lbs. (~68 kg) of ROBOT  MECHANISMS may be 
inspected together, the ROBOT  configuration used in a MATCH  may not violate R103). The OPERATOR 
CONSOLE and exceptions listed in R103  are not included in this weight.  
I104 *Unless the change is listed below, any change to a ROBOT  must get re -inspected. A ROBOT  may play 
MATCHES  with a subset of the MECHANISMS that were present during inspection provided the 
reconfigured ROBOT  still complies with all ROBOT  Construction Rules. Only MECHANISMS that were 
present during the inspection may be added, removed, or reconfigured between MATCHES  without re -
inspection per this rule. If a ROBOT  is modified after its most recent passed inspection, it must be re -
inspected before it is eligible to participate in a MATCH .  
Exceptions are listed in A through F (unless they result in a significant change to the ROBOT ’S size, 
weight, legality, or safety).  
A. addition, relocation, or removal of fasteners (e.g. cable ties, tape, and rivets),  
B. addition, relocation, or removal of labeling or marking,  
C. revision of ROBOT  code,  
D. replacement of a COTS COMPONENT with an identical COTS COMPONENT,  
E. replacement of a MECHANISM with an identical MECHANISM (size, weight, material), and  
 
Section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)  V2 117 of 164 F. additions, removals, or reconfiguration of ROBOT  with a subset of MECHANISMS already 
inspected per  I103 . 
I105 *Don’t exploit re -inspection.  Teams may not use the re -inspection process in I104  to circumvent the 
weight limit in  I103 . 
This restriction is not intended to prevent a team from returning to a previous 
configuration (e.g. due to an unsuccessful upgrade or failure of a new 
COMPONENT). If a team is believed to be violating this rule, the LRI will discuss 
the situation with the team to understand the changes and, if appropriate, the LRI 
in conjunction with the team will select a single configuration with which the 
team will compete for the duration of the event.  
Example 1: A ROBOT  passes initial inspection (which includes MECHANISM A). 
Its team then decides they want to use MECHANISM B, which was not inspected. 
The weight of the ROBOT , A, and B is less than the weight limit in I103 , but more 
than that in R103. I104  requires the ROBOT  be re -inspected, and this rule allows 
the ROBOT , A, and B to be inspected collectively. If passed, the ROBOT  may then 
compete in subsequent MATCHES  with A or B.  
Example 2: A ROBOT  passes initial inspection (which includes MECHANISM A). 
Its team then decides they want to use MECHANISM B, which was not inspected. 
The weight of the ROBOT , A, and B is greater than the weight limit in I103 . This 
requires re -inspection per I104  and A is excluded to satisfy  I103 . B breaks, and 
the team decides to switch back to A. The ROBOT  must be re -inspected per  I104 , 
and the team is not violating this rule.  
Example 3: A team arrives at an event with a ROBOT , MECHANISM A, and 
MECHANISM B, which collectively weigh 175 lbs (79 kg). The ROBOT  passes 
initial inspection with A and plays a MATCH . The team switches to B, gets re -
inspected, and plays again. The team switches back to A, gets re -inspected, and 
plays again. The team switches back to B and asks to be re -inspected. At this 
point, the LRI suspects the team may be violating this rule and has a discussion 
with the team to understand the changes being made. The team reveals that this 
rule has been violated, and the LRI works with them to select A or B for use for 
the remainder of the event.  
I106 *ROBOTS  are off for inspection (mostly).  For the safety of all those involved, ROBOTS , must be 
presented for inspection with the ROBOT  powered off, pneumatics unpressurized, and springs or other 
stored energy devices in their lowest potential energy states (e.g. battery removed).  
Power and air pressure should only be enabled on the ROBOT  during those portions of the inspection 
process where it is absolutely required to validate certain system functionality and compliance with 
specific rules (firmware check, etc.). INSPECTORS may allow the ROBOT  to be powered beyond the 
parameters above if both criteria below are met:  
A. the ROBOT  design requires power or a charged stored energy device in order to confirm that the 
ROBOT  meets volume requirements and  
B. the team has included safety interlocks that mitigate unexpected release of such stored energy.  
The team may be asked to demonstrate these interlocks during the inspection 
process.  
 
Section 9 Inspection & Eligibility (I)  V2 118 of 164 I107 *No STUDENT, no inspection.  At least 1 STUDENT team member must accompany the ROBOT  for any 
inspection efforts.  
Exceptions may be made for major conflicts, e.g. religious holidays, major 
testing, transportation issues, etc.  

 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 119 of 164 10 Tournaments  (T) 
Each 2025  FIRST Robotics Competition event is played in a tournament format. Each tournament consists of 3 
types of MATCHES : Practice MATCHES  (not necessarily played at all District Events), Qualification MATCHES , 
and Playoff MATCHES . 
Practice MATCHES  provide each team with an opportunity to operate its ROBOT  on the FIELD prior to the start 
of the Qualification MATCHES . 
Qualification MATCHES  allow each team to earn Ranking Points which determine their seeding position and 
may qualify them for participation in the Playoff MATCHES . 
Playoff MATCHES  determine the event Champions.  
10.1 MATCH  Schedules  
A MATCH  schedule is used to coordinate MATCHES  at an Event. Figure 10 -1 details information shown on 
each schedule. SURROGATE MATCHES  are described in section 10.5.2  MATCH Assignment . 
Figure 10-1 Sample MATCH  schedule  
 
10.2 MATCH  Replays  
Over the course of the tournament, it may be necessary for a MATCH  to be replayed. Typical causes for 
replays are MATCHES  that end in a tie during the Playoffs  (due to criteria listed in Table 10 -3 or any Finals 
MATCH) , MATCHES  that are stopped because FIELD STAFF anticipated FIELD damage or personal injury, or if 
there is an ARENA FAULT . An ARENA FAULT  is an error in ARENA  operation that includes, but is not limited to:  
A. broken FIELD elements due to  
a. normal, expected game play or  
b. ROBOT abuse of FIELD elements that affects the outcome of the MATCH for their 
opponents   
A broken FIELD element caused by ROBOT  abuse that affects the outcome of the 
MATCH  for their ALLIANCE is not an ARENA FAULT . 
B. power failure to a portion of the FIELD (tripping the circuit breaker in the DRIVER STATION is not considered a power failure),  
C. improper activation by the FMS,  
D. errors by FIELD STAFF (except those listed in s ection 6.8 Other Logistics ), and  

 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 120 of 164 E. a ROBOT radio disconnect that impair s operation  of other ROBOTS  on the FIELD  for more than  8 
seconds .  
If, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, an ARENA FAULT  occurs that affects the outcome of the MATCH  and 
any team on the affected ALLIANCE desires a replay, the MATCH  will be replayed. FIRST Headquarters 
reserves the right to, with consultation of the Head REFEREE and the FTA, replay a MATCH  in which an ARENA 
FAULT  impacts the outcome of an event.  
The outcome of the MATCH  is affected if an error occurs that, in the judgement 
of the Head REFEREE, changes which ALLIANCE would have won the MATCH  
and/or the assignment of Ranking Points.  
The outcome of an event is affected if an error occurs that, in the judgement of 
FIRST Headquarters, changes the assignment of Ranking Points or has a 
dramatic effect on points used for ranking criteria.  
Note that an ARENA FAULT  that does not affect MATCH  outcome, in the 
judgement of the Head REFEREE, does not lead to a MATCH  replay. Examples 
include, but are not limited to:  
A. a piece of FIELD plastic falls into the FIELD, far away from any human or 
ROBOT  activity, and in such a way that it does not affect MATCH  outcome,  
B. delay in the playing of an ARENA  sound,  
C. mismatch  between the timer on the audience screen and the ARENA  timer,  
D. any adjustment or delay in assignment of a score or penalty (including those 
made after the MATCH ), and  
E. the disconnect described in scenario E occurring before the last 20 seconds 
of the MATCH . 
Examples of errors by FIELD STAFF include, but are not limited to:  
F. a gate being left open when the MATCH starts , 
G. mistakenly allowing  a ROBOT in violation of I102 that hasn’t passed an initial, 
complete inspection to participate in the MATCH  
T201  *Replays will be the same.  All reasonable  effort is made to create the same conditions when replaying 
a MATCH  caused by an ARENA FAULT  or FIELD  damage. This means, for example, that a team that 
was BYPASSED  prior to the start of the MATCH  which is to be replayed is BYPASSED  for the replay 
MATCH . ROBOT  and DRIVE TEAM starting locations do not need to be replicated when replaying a 
MATCH .  
Violation: MATCH  with not start until the situation is corrected  
Per section 6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS , cards assigned in previous 
MATCHES, including prior instances of the MATCH to be replayed, are not 
cleared.  
10.3 Measurement  
At each event, the ARENA  will be open for at least 30 minutes prior to the start of Qualification MATCHES , 
during which time teams may survey and/or measure the ARENA and bring ROBOTS  on the FIELD to perform 
sensor calibration. The specific time that the FIELD is open will be communicated to teams at the event. 
Teams may bring specific questions or comments to the FTA.  
T301  *Measurement, not practice.  During the period when  the ARENA  is open for measurement :  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 121 of 164 A. ROBOTS can be enabled, but may neither drive, extend outside their ROBOT PERIMETER, nor 
interact with (e.g. score, push, pickup, etc.) SCORING ELEMENTS (or anything resembling 
SCORING ELEMENTS), a CAGE, PROCESSOR, REEF, CORAL STATION, or other FIELD elements.  
B. Humans may touch a SCORING ELEMENT but may not practice with it (e.g. throw ALGAE, or 
anything resembling ALGAE, or use the CORAL STATION)  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING , plus YELLOW CARD i f subsequent violations at any point during the event or 
egregious.  
10.4 Practice MATCHES 
Practice MATCHES  are played before Qualification MATCHES . The Practice MATCH  schedule is available as 
soon as possible, but no later than the start of Practice MATCHES . For Regional events, it will also be 
published and available online on the FRC-Event s website, except during exceptional circumstances. Practice 
MATCHES  are randomly assigned, and teams may not switch scheduled Practice MATCHES . Each team is 
assigned an equal number of Practice MATCHES  unless the number of teams multiplied by number of Practice 
MATCHES  is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly selects some teams to play an extra Practice 
MATCH . 
Practice MATCHES  are not guaranteed at District Events due to event schedule constraints.  
10.4.1  Filler Line  
A Filler Line is used to fill open slots at events that employ scheduled Practice MATCHES  or all slots at events 
with an open Practice MATCH  schedule. Teams from the Filler Line are used on a first come, first served basis 
to fill empty spots in Practice MATCHES  left by other teams that do not report to Queueing. The number of 
teams in the Filler Line is dependent upon space at venues.  
Only teams that meet all criteria below qualify for the Filler Line:  
A. ROBOTS  in the Filler Line must have passed inspection (this requirement may be waived for 
events with open Practice MATCH  schedules),  
B. DRIVE TEAMS must join the Filler Line with their ROBOT , 
C. teams may not work on their ROBOT  while in the Filler Line,  
D. teams may not occupy more than 1 spot in the Filler Line, and  
E. if a team is queued for their Practice MATCH , they may not also join the Filler Line.  
10.5 Qualification MATCHES  
10.5.1  Schedule  
The Qualification MATCH  schedule is made available as soon as possible, but no later than 30 minutes before 
Qualification MATCHES  are scheduled to begin. Teams receive 1 hard copy and it is also available on  the FRC-
Event s website, except during exceptional circumstances. Each Qualification schedule consists of a series of 
rounds in which each team plays 1 MATCH  per round.  
10.5.2  MATCH  Assignment  
FMS assigns each team 2 ALLIANCE  partners for each Qualification MATCH  using a predefined algorithm, and 
teams may not switch Qualification MATCH  assignments. The algorithm employs the following criteria, listed 
in order of priority:  
1. ensure each team has at least the minimum required time between MATCHES (varies by  event size)  
2. minimize the number of times a team is allied with any team  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 122 of 164 3. minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team  
4. minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to play an extra Qualification 
MATCH ) 
5. provide even distribution of MATCHES  played on blue and red ALLIANCE  
6. provide even distribution of MATCHES  played in each DRIVER STATION number  
For more information about the MATCH  scheduling algorithm, please see Idle 
Loop software’s website . 
At events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the criteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to minimize the number of times a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even 
distribution.  
All teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES , equal to the number of rounds, unless the 
number of teams multiplied by number of MATCHES  is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly 
selects some teams to play an extra MATCH . For the purpose of seeding calculations, those teams are 
designated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH . If a team plays a MATCH  as a SURROGATE, it is indicated 
on the MATCH  schedule, it is always their third Qualification MATCH , and the outcome of the MATCH  has no 
effect on the team’s ranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward to subsequent MATCHES . 
10.5.3  Qualification Ranking  
Ranking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE’S performance in Qualification 
MATCHES . Ranking Points are awarded to each eligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH  
per Table 6 -2. 
Exceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows:  
A. A SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points.  
B. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0 Ranking Points .  
C. A “no -show” team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for that MATCH  (see G208 ). 
A team is declared a no -show if no member of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE  AREA at the 
start of the MATCH . 
The total number of Ranking Points earned by a team throughout their Qualification MATCHES  divided by the 
number of MATCHES  they’ve been scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH ), then rounded  to 2 
decimal places, is their Ranking Score (RS).  
All teams participating in Qualification MATCHES  are ranked by Ranking Score. If the number of teams in 
attendance is ‘n’, they are ranked ‘1’ through ‘n’, with ‘1’ being the team with the highest Ranking Score and ‘n’ being the team with the lowest Ranking Score.  
Teams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria defined in Table 10 -1. 
Table 10-1 Qualification MATCH  ranking criteria  
Order Sort  Criteria  
1st Ranking Score

10.6 Playoff MATCHES  
Playoff MATCHES  follow the qualification MATCHES . In the Playoffs, teams play on set ALLIANCES , chosen 
during ALLIANCE selection, and advance through a double elimination bracket. Teams do not earn Ranking 
Points; they advance based on winning, losing, or tying a MATCH . 
A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, causes their alliance to receive 0 MATCH points 
in a Playoff MATCH.  
10.6.1  ALLIANCE Selection Process  
At the end of the Qualification MATCHES , the top 8 ranked teams become the ALLIANCE Leads. The ranked 
ALLIANCES are designated, in order, ALLIANCE  1, ALLIANCE 2, etc., down to ALLIANCE 8. Using the ALLIANCE 
selection process described in this section, each ALLIANCE Lead chooses 2 other teams to join their 
ALLIANCE. 
A break of 8 minutes  (8:00)  occur s between the posting of scores from the last qualification match  (scheduled 
or replay, whichever comes later) and the start of the ALLIANCE Selection process  for events that host Alliance 
Selection shortly after QUALIFICATION MATCHES . At the end of this break, ALLIANCE 1 is  “on the clock” as 
defined below in  T605 . 
T601  *Send your  STUDENT representatives.  Each team must choose and send a minimum of one and a 
maximum of three  STUDENT team representative s. Representative(s) must report  to the ARENA  before 
the start of ALLIANCE Selection .  
Violation: Team is ineligible for the Playoff Tournament  if they are not represented by the time they are 
announced.  
If an absent team would have been an ALLIANCE Lead, all lower ranked 
ALLIANCE Leads are promoted 1 spot.  
The designated STUDENT representative from each ALLIANCE Lead is called the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  (if the 
ALLIANCE has sent multiple STUDENT representatives, they must designate only one as the ALLIANCE 
CAPTAIN). This representative may change between ALLIANCE selection and Playoff MATCHES.  
T602  *STUDENTS must outnumber adults. A non -STUDENT may additionally be a representative from a 
team if the team has exactly two STUDENT representatives.  
Violation: Non-STUDENT must leave the ARENA  
These are the possible combinations of ALLIANCE Selection representatives 
between T601 /T602 : 
A. One STUDENT  
B. Two STUDENTS  
C. Three STUDENTS  
D. Two STUDENTS and one non -STUDENT  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 124 of 164 The ALLIANCE selection process consists of rounds during which each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN invites a team 
ranked below them in the standings to join their ALLIANCE. The invited team’s representative must either 
accept or decline the invitation immediately. If the team accepts, it becomes a member of that ALLIANCE. This process results in 8 ALLIANCES of 3 teams.  
Each round is complete when all ALLIANCES have added one additional team, and each round must be complete before the next round can begin. In round 1 selections are made in descending order (ALLIANCE 1 to ALLIANCE 8), whereas in round 2 selections are made  in ascending order (ALLIANCE 8 to ALLIANCE 1).  
T603  * Only STUDENTS  may use the mic . Only a single  STUDENT  from the invited team is  allowed to 
accept/decline . 
Violation: The team is assumed to have declined.  
T604  * Only the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may invite an ALLIANCE.  The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN is the only 
representative of the ALLIANCE who may  approach the e mcee and make a valid pick via the 
microphone . 
Violation: Pick does not count, and pick timer continues to count down.  
T605  * Picks are time limited . Once the emcee requests an ALLIANCE’S selection, the ALLIANCE is 
considered “on the clock” and the pick timer begins to countdown. In round 1, the timer begins at 45 seconds  (0:45) , in round 2 the timer begins at 1 minute and 3 0 seconds  (1:30). A sound will play to 
indicate that there are  5 seconds left on the timer and a buzzer will go off  to indicate the end of the 
time. The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN must make a good faith effort , as determined by the FTA or their 
designee,  to state a valid team selection before the expiration o f the pick timer.  
Violation: The ALLIANCE is skipped, and the emcee moves to the next ALLIANCE, unless the selection is 
the last of a round in which case the ALLIANCE receives the next highest -ranked unselected team to the 
ALLIANCE . 
The time  remaining on the pick timer is  displayed  on the FIELD timers. Please 
note that audio cues are intended as a courtesy to participants and not intended 
as official markers . 
A valid team selection includes any team who has not yet accepted or declined 
an invitation to join another ALLIANCE and is not an ALLIANCE Lead that has had 
a pick timer violation. If an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN attempts to select a team that is 
not valid, the pick timer continue s to run until it either expires, or a different 
(valid) team is invited to join the ALLIANCE.  
Examples of good faith efforts to state a valid team selection include but are not 
limited to:  
A. Walking safely towards the emcee  when the clock hits zero  
B. Starting to state a team as the clock hits zero  
Examples that are not considered good faith efforts to quickly state a valid team 
selection include but are not limited to:  
C. Continuing to talk with your ALLIANCE partners without moving towards the 
emcee 
D. Talking  into the microphone  for more than approximately 30 seconds without  
clearly stating  a team number to invite   
If an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN extends a valid invitation and the invited team declines, the pick clock resets to the time for the designated round and restarts immediately.  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 125 of 164 After each accepted ALLIANCE invitation or T605  violation, the emcee invites any ALLIANCE CAPTAINS that 
received a T605  violation in that round to make their selections. Each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may either indicate 
that they are ready to make their selection (and immediately do so  as determined by the FTA or their designee ) 
or indicate that they are not yet ready, and they will be revisited after the next accepted invitation or T605  
violation . If a team with a T605  violation extends a valid invitation and the invited team declines, they are 
allowed to make another selection immediately or else they are skipped and will be revisited as described 
above.  If there are multiple ALLIANCE CAPTAINS that have received T605  violations, they are revisited in the 
same order in which they received their violations.  If all remaining teams in a round have received a T605  
violation, each team is revisited to either make a pick immediately or receive the next highest -ranked 
unselected team.  
The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN with the last selection of a given round may not be the 
ALLIANCE CAPTAIN scheduled  to have the final pick. For example, imagine in 
round 1 that ALLIANCES 1 -6 have all made valid selections and ALLIANCE Lead 7 
receives a T605  violation. If ALLIANCE Lead 8 makes a valid selection, then 
ALLIANCE Lead 7 now has the final selection of round 1.  
A break of 2 minutes  (2:00)  occur s between each round of selections. At the conclusion of the break, the 
ALLIANCE scheduled to make the next selection go es “on the clock” and their timer begin s per T605 . 
T606  *Declining teams can’t be picked. An ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  may not invite a team that has declined 
another ALLIANCE’S invitation to participate in the Playoff tournament. Declining teams are ineligible to 
be a BACKUP TEAM . 
Violation: The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  must make another selection  and pick timer continues to count down.  
An ALLIANCE  Lead that declines an invitation from another ALLIANCE  is able to invite teams to join their 
ALLIANCE but may not be invited to join another ALLIANCE. 
At the conclusion of ALLIANCE  selection, the highest ranked unselected teams are eligible to become a 
BACKUP TEAM , as defined in section  10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS . 
10.6.2  Playoff MATCH  Bracket  
The double elimination tournament consists of an Upper and Lower bracket as shown in Figure 10 -2. Each 
ALLIANCE begins with a slot in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE wins a MATCH  in the Upper bracket, they 
remain in the Upper bracket. If an ALLIANCE  loses a MATCH  in the Upper bracket, they transition to the Lower 
bracket. ALLIANCES in the Lower bracket must win any subsequent MATCHES  (except for finals) to remain in 
the tournament, i.e. once they lose a MATCH , they’re out of the tournament.  
In Round 1, the higher ranked ALLIANCE  is assigned to the red ALLIANCE . For subsequent rounds, ALLIANCE 
color is assigned as shown in Figure 10 -2, regardless of ALLIANCE rank at the start of the Playoff tournament.  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 126 of 164 Figure 10-2 Playoff MATCH  bracket (Red ALLIANCE  tops each pairing)  
 
As shown in Figure 10 -2 and Table 10 -2, Playoff MATCHES  consist of 6 rounds with breaks between  later  
rounds and between Finals MATCHES . Breaks begin after the FIELD has been cleared from the previous 
MATCH . The Blue and Red Gap columns indicate the approximate time between each ALLIANCE’S  MATCHES . 
The expected start time of the scheduled MATCH  is the time indicated on the MATCH  schedule or 15 minutes 
from the end of either ALLIANCE’S  previous MATCH , whichever is later.  Occasionally,  replayed MATCHES 
within a round may be played out of order; if MATCHES are played out of order, teams are informed by the 
emcee, FIELD STAFF, and/or q ueueing staff.  
If a Playoff MATCH  needs to be replayed as described in s ection  10.2  MATCH Replays , teams are notified of 
when the replay will occur. A minimum 10 -minute delay is provided for teams to reset their ROBOTS  prior to 
the replay unless all teams are ready sooner. The affected MATCH  must be replayed before the next round 
begins.

10.6.2.1  Playoff MATCH  ties 
If final MATCH  scores for both ALLIANCES  are equal, the win is awarded to the ALLIANCE per criteria listed in 
Table 10 -3.  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 128 of 164 Table 10-3 Playoff MATCH  Tiebreaker Criteria

1st Cumulative MAJOR FOUL  points due to opponent rule violations  
2nd  ALLIANCE LEAVE + AUTO CORAL  points  
3rd  ALLIANCE BARGE  points  
4th MATCH  is replayed  
10.6.2.2  Playoff Finals  
Once a single ALLIANCE remains in each Upper and Lower bracket, those ALLIANCES proceed to the Finals 
round. The first ALLIANCE to win 2 MATCHES  in the Finals becomes the event’s Champions.  
If a Finals MATCH  ends in a tie score, the tie is not broken using the criteria in Table 10 -3, the MATCH  remains 
a tie. In the case where an ALLIANCE hasn’t won 2 MATCHES  after 3 MATCHES  have been played (because of 
tied MATCHES ), the Playoffs proceed with up to 3 additional Finals MATCHES , called Overtime MATCHES , until 
an ALLIANCE  has won 2 Finals MATCHES . In the case where the Overtime MATCH  scores for both ALLIANCES 
are equal, the win for that Overtime MATCH  is awarded based on the criteria listed in Table 10 -3. 
10.6.3  BACKUP TEAM S 
During the Playoff MATCHES  an ALLIANCE CAPTAIN may elect to replace one of its ROBOTS . The team whose 
ROBOT  and DRIVE TEAM  replaces another ROBOT  and DRIVE TEAM  on an ALLIANCE during the Playoff 
MATCHES  is called the BACKUP TEAM . 
In this situation, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  has the option to bring in the highest ranked team from the pool of 
available teams to join its ALLIANCE  for the following MATCH . The resulting ALLIANCE is then composed of 4 
teams.  
ALLIANCES submit LINEUPS  (as described in s ection 10.6.4 LINEUPS ) for each 
Playoff MATCH . After the BACKUP TEAM’s first Playoff MATCH , the ALLIANCE’S 
LINEUP  may consist of any 3 of the ALLIANCE’S  4 teams.  
10.6.3.1  BACKUP TEAM  Coupons  
Each ALLIANCE  is allotted 1 BACKUP TEAM  coupon during the Playoff MATCHES . If two  or more ROBOT S 
from the ALLIANCE  become inoperable, then the ALLIANCE must play the following MATCHES  with only 2 (or 
even 1) ROBOTS . 
Example: 3 teams, A, B and C, form an ALLIANCE  going into the Playoff 
MATCHES . The highest ranked team not on 1 of the 8 ALLIANCES  is Team D. 
During 1 of the Playoff MATCHES , Team C’s ROBOT  suffers damage to its 
mechanical arm. The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  decides to bring in Team D to replace 
Team C in the next MATCH . The new ALLIANCE of Teams A, B, C, and D are 
successful in advancing to the Finals and win the event. Teams A, B, C, and D are 
all recognized as members of the Winning ALLIANCE and receive awards.  
The Head REFEREE will not accept the BACKUP TEAM  coupon unless it lists the number of the team whose 
ROBOT  is being replaced and is initialed by the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN . Once a BACKUP TEAM  coupon is 
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 129 of 164 submitted and accepted by the Head REFEREE, the BACKUP TEAM coupon may not be withdrawn by the 
ALLIANCE. 
T607  *No BACKUP TEAM  for replayed MATCHES . An ALLIANCE  may not request a BACKUP TEAM for a 
replayed MATCH . The sole exception is if, in the judgment of the Head REFEREE, the replay is due to an 
ARENA FAULT  that rendered an ALLIANCE’S ROBOT  inoperable.  
Violation: The request is denied.  
T608  *No BACKUP TEAMS  for 1st MATCH . An ALLIANCE  may not request a BACKUP TEAM until after their 
first Playoff MATCH . 
Violation: The request is denied.  
T609  *BACKUP TEAMS  play when called.  A BACKUP TEAM  must be included in the LINEUP  for the 
ALLIANCE’S next MATCH  following their recruitment.  
Violation: The LINEUP  is denied.  
If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  
remains in the Question Box to report the LINEUP . 
T610  *BACKUP TEAMS  due 2 minutes before the MATCH  start time.  The BACKUP TEAM  Coupon must be 
submitted to the Head REFEREE (or their designee) by the ALLIANCE CAPTIAN  not later than 2 minutes 
before the expected MATCH  start time in which the BACKUP TEAM  is to play.  
Violation: The request is denied  
If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  
remains in the Question Box to submit the BACKUP TEAM  coupon.  
10.6.3.2  BACKUP POOL  
After the top ranked ALLIANCE has made their final pick during ALLIANCE Selection, the lead queuer (or their 
designee) polls the remaining eligible teams. In rank order, the lead queuer (or their designee) will invite  
remaining teams to accept or decline a position in the BACKUP POOL , i.e. the group of teams willing and able 
to join an ALLIANCE  during the Playoff MATCHES , if needed, until up to 8 teams accept.  
T611  *Be there to be a BACKUP TEAM . A team must be present after ALLIANCE Selection to accept the lead 
queuer’s  (or their designee) invitation to join the BACKUP POOL . 
Violation: Team is ineligible to be a BACKUP TEAM . 
T612  *Send a BACKUP TEAM  Representative.  The top 2 ranked BACKUP TEAMS must send at least 1 
STUDENT  representative (and optionally 1 additional STUDENT  or mentor) to a designated area near 
the FIELD  for the duration of the Playoff MATCHES .  
These 2 representatives are available to answer questions and accept invitations to be a BACKUP TEAM from ALLIANCE CAPTAINS . If 1 of these 2 teams joins an ALLIANCE or excuses themselves 
from the BACKUP POOL , the next highest ranked team in the BACKUP POOL  must provide their 
representative. Once a BACKUP TEAM  has declined an invitation to join an ALLIANCE , it is no longer a 
member of the BACKUP POOL  and ineligible to join another ALLIANCE . 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING , plus the team is removed from BACKUP POOL i f the situation cannot be 
corrected within a reasonable amount of time.  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 130 of 164 Some events may offer an area near the FIELD  where the top 1 or 2 teams in the 
BACKUP POOL  may choose to stage their ROBOT  for quick and easy access to 
the FIELD  if recruited.  
10.6.4  LINEUPS  
Each ALLIANCE  competing in a Playoff MATCH  has the option to submit a LINEUP , which lists the 3 teams 
participating in the MATCH  and their selected DRIVER STATIONS.  
The LINEUP  is kept confidential until the FIELD  is set for the MATCH  at which point each ALLIANCE’S LINEUP  
appears on the Team Signs.  
10.6.4.1  LINEUPS  for 4 -team ALLIANCES  
If an ALLIANCE  has 4 members (either because a 3 -team ALLIANCE has called a BACKUP TEAM or the event 
is the FIRST Championship), a single representative from the team not on the LINEUP  is allowed as a sixteenth 
ALLIANCE member but must be a member of that team’s DRIVE TEAM. This additional representative may only 
serve as a COACH.   
10.6.4.2  Default LINEUP  
T613  *LINEUPS due 2 minutes before the MATCH . The ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  must submit their LINEUP  in 
writing to the Head REFEREE (or their designee) 2 minutes before their expected MATCH  start time.  
Violation: Late LINEUPS  are denied, and the ALLIANCE’S most recent LINEUP  is applied.  
If the Head REFEREE is busy, and there is no designee, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  
remains in the Question Box to report the LINEUP . 
If no previous LINEUP  exists, the ALLIANCE Lead is assigned DRIVER STATION 2, 
1st team selected is assigned DRIVER STATION 1, and the 2nd team selected is 
assigned DRIVER STATION 3. If any of these 3 ROBOTS  are unable to play, the 
ALLIANCE must play the MATCH  with only 2 (or even 1) ROBOT (s). 
Example: 3 teams, A, B, and C form an ALLIANCE  going into the Playoff 
MATCHES . During one of the Playoff MATCHES , Team C’s ROBOT  becomes 
inoperable. The ALLIANCE  decides to bring in Team D to replace Team C. Team 
C repairs their ROBOT  and may play in any subsequent Playoff MATCHES  
replacing Team A, B, or D  
If a BACKUP TEAM Coupon is accepted and the LINEUP  for the next MATCH  is 
not submitted or it omits the BACKUP TEAM , then the ALLIANCE’S most recent 
LINEUP  is used with the BACKUP TEAM  in the position populated by the team for 
whom they’re substituting.  
T614  *For replays, no changing LINEUPS  (mostly).  If a MATCH  must be replayed due to an ARENA FAULT , 
the LINEUP  for the replayed MATCH  is the same as the original MATCH . The sole exception is if , in the 
opinion of the Head REFEREE, the ARENA FAULT  rendered a ROBOT  inoperable, in which case the 
LINEUP  can be changed.  
Violation: The new LINEUP  is denied.  
 
Section 10 Tournaments (T)  V6 131 of 164 10.6.5  Pit Crews  
During the Playoff MATCHES  and because of the distance between the FIELD  and the pit area, extra team 
members may be needed to maintain and otherwise assist with the ROBOT  between MATCHES . Each team is 
permitted to have up to 3 additional pit crew members to help with needed ROBOT  repairs/maintenance.  
10.6.6  Small Event Exceptions  
The scheduling algorithm described in section 10.5.2  MATCH Assignment  works to minimize teams playing in 
back -to-back MATCHES . However, at events with fewer than 24 teams, back -to-back plays may occur.  
Multi- day events with 24 teams or fewer employ a modified Playoff MATCH  format. Instead of 8 ALLIANCES , 
these events proceed through ALLIANCE  SELECTION and the Playoff Tournament with the maximum number 
of complete 3 -team ALLIANCES  that can be formed while leaving at least 1 BACKUP TEAM (e.g. a 24 -team 
event creates 7 ALLIANCES , a 20 -team event creates 6 ALLIANCES ).

The Playoff Bracket remains as shown in Figure 10 -2, with any matchup  against a non -existent ALLIANCE  
resulting in a bye (i.e. automatic advancement to the next round). An ALLIANCE  assigned a bye -MATCH  is 
invited, though not required, to practice together in a null MATCH  (i.e. it has no bearing on the Playoff 
tournament) during the designated time in the Playoff schedule.  
District points for Draft Order Acceptance (per section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results ) are awarded as if a 
full set of ALLIANCES  was selected (i.e. the 2nd selection of the 3 -seed ALLIANCE  still receive 3 points 
regardless of how many ALLIANCES  are formed).  


 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 133 of 164 11 Dist rict Tournaments  
Teams advance through the season depending on the events at which they compete: Regional or District. This 
section details how District teams advance from District qualifying events to their District Championship.  
11.1 District Events  
District teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they earn at the first 2 home District events they attend, as well as at their District Championship. Points are awarded to teams as follows:

(For a typically sized District event, this will result in a minimum of 4 points being awarded for Qualification round performance. For events of all sizes, a maximum of 22 points will be awarded.)  
ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  Equal to 17 minus the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  number (e.g. 14 points for ALLIANCE  #3 
Captain) 
Draft Order Acceptance  Equal to 17 minus the Draft Order Acceptance Number (e.g. 12 points for the team that accepts the fifth draft position, regardless of whether it was delayed per T605 .) 
Playoff Advancement  Points awarded based on team participation in individual playoff rounds, and whether or not the ALLIANCE advances. See section 11.1.3 Playoff Performance  for details.  
Judged Team Awards  10 points for FIRST Impact Award  
8 points each for Engineering Inspiration and Rookie All Star Awards 
5 points each for all other judged team awards  
Team Age  10 points for 2025  rookie teams 
5 points for 202 4 rookie teams  
Points earned at District Championships are multiplied by 3 and then added to points earned at District events, 
to determine the final season point total for the team.  
If there is a tie in the season point total between teams, the higher ranked team will be determined  using the 
following additional sorting criteria:

8th Third  highest Individual MATCH  Score, regardless of whether that score occurred in a 
Qualification or Playoff MATCH  
9th Random Selection  
11.1.1  Qualification Round Performance  
The calculation of Qualification performance points is done using the equation (an inverse error function) in 
Table 11 -1. The equation utilizes the following variables:  
− R – the qualification rank of the team at the event at the conclusion of Qualification MATCHES  (as 
reported by FMS)  
− N – the number of FIRST Robotics Competition teams participating in the Qualification rounds at the 
event  
− Alpha (α) – a static value (1.07) used to standardize the distribution of points at events  
This formula generates an approximately normal distribution of Qualification Round Performance points at an event, based on rank, with most teams getting a moderate number of points, and fewer teams getting the highest or lowest numbers of points available . 
Table 11 -3 displays sample Qualification Round Performance points for variously ranked teams at a 40 -team 
event. The system will automatically generate the appropriate points for each team based on their rank and the number of teams at the event.  
Table 11-3 Sample Qualification Round point assignments  
Rank  1 2 3 4 … 19 20 21 … 37 38 39 40 
Points  22 21 20 19 … 13 13 12 … 6 6 5 4 
 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 135 of 164 11.1.2  ALLIANCE Selection Results 
This attribute measures both individual team qualification round seeding performance and recognition by 
peers.  
ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  are recognized based on their qualification round seeding rank. This rank is a result of 
the rules of the game, which typically incorporate several team performance attributes, and are designed to eliminate ties in rank. Non -ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  are rewarded based on peer recognition. To be invited to join 
an ALLIANCE , a team’s peers have decided that the team has attributes that are desirable. Giving points for 
ALLIANCE selection also supports come -from -behind teams. A team taking several MA TCHES  to optimize 
their performance may be recognized as a late bloomer by a top seeded team, even if that performance isn’t reflected in the rankings because of poor performance in early MATCHES . These points also have the potential 
to recognize teams employing a minority strategy with their ROBOT . Teams with unique or divergent ROBOT  
capabilities that complement the strengths of other ALLIANCE members may be selected to fill a strategic 
niche.  
Note also that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  are given the same number of points as the team drafted in the same 
sequence. For example, the third ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  gets the same number of points as the third draft. 
Numerical analysis supports the idea that ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  are about as strong in ROBOT  performance as 
equivalently drafted teams. As an additional minor benefit, awarding the same points for ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  
and equivalent drafts lubricates the acceptance of draft offers between ALLIANCE CAPTAINS , which gi ves 
teams out of the top 8 the chance to experience being ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  themselves.  
11.1.3  Playoff Performance  
This attribute measures team performance as part of an ALLIANCE.  
Teams that advance to at least MATCH 12 earn Double Elimination (DE) Points per the formula below, where β 
is defined in Table 11 -4. 
𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 𝐵𝐵𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃=# 𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴 𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴𝑇𝑇 𝐴𝐴𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴𝑀𝑀 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑 ℎ𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐ℎ 𝐴𝐴 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴  𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐  & 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟

2nd Place ( Finalist s) 20 
3rd Place (loser of MATCH  13) 13 
4th Place (loser of MATCH  12) 7 
In most cases, unless a BACKUP is recruited, a team plays 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, thus their DE Points simply equal β. If a team does not play 100% of the DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, their DE Points equal their β value multiplied by the percentage of DE MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE in which that team participated. If the result is not a whole number, the value is rounded up to the nearest integer.  
Teams on the winning ALLIANCE are awarded additional Finals Points, which are 5 points for each Finals MATCH won and in which the team participated, up to a maximum of 10 points.  
 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 136 of 164 For example, if Team X’s ALLIANCE wins the event, but Team X only played in 2 
MATCHES won by their ALLIANCE, MATCH 13 and Final 1, Team X’s Playoff 
Performance points are 20 * (1/5) + 5 = 9 points .  
The maximum number of Playoff Performance Points a team can earn is 30 (20 DE points + 10 Finals Points).  
11.1.4  Awards  
This attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards judged at the event.  
The points earned for team awards in this system are not intended to capture the full value of the award to the 
team winning the award, or to represent the full value of the award to FIRST . In many ways, the team’s 
experience in being selected for awards, especially the FIRST Impact Award, the Engineering Inspiration Award, 
and the Rookie All Star Award (which is optional for District Championship events), is beyond measure, and could not be fully captured in its entirety by any points -based system. Points are being assigned to awards in 
this system only to help teams recognize that FIRST continues to be “ More than Robots
®,” with the emphasis 
on our cultural awards, and to assist in elevating award -winning teams above non-award- winning teams in the 
ranking system.  
Teams only get points for team awards judged at the event. If an award is not judged, is not for a team (e.g. the Dean’s List Award) or is not judged at the event (e.g. Safety Animation Award, sponsored by UL), no points are earned.  
11.1.5  Team Age  
This attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team.  
Points are awarded to 202 4 and 2025 rookie teams  in recognition of the unique challenges teams face in 
those early years, and to increase the chance that they will make it to the District Championship to compete with their ROBOTS . Like our dedicated Rookie awards, these additional points are intended to recognize and 
motivate newer participants in FIRST Robotics Competition. These points are awarded once at the beginning of 
the season. Rookie year is calculated based on the year in which FIRST recognizes the team as a rookie.  
11.1.6  Regional Participation  
District teams neither earn points for their actions at any Regionals, nor are eligible for any FIRST Championship qualifying benefits at that Regional (awards, etc.).  
11.2 District Championship Eligibility  
A team competing in a District qualifies for their District Championship by meeting 1 of the following criteria:  
A. District FIRST Impact Award Winner,  
B. District Ranking (based on total points earned at their first 2 home District events as detailed in section 11.1  District Events ),   
Teams do not earn points at third or subsequent District events, nor at any inter -
district or Regional events at which they compete during the season.  
If a team declines an invitation to the District Championship, the next highest 
uninvited team on the list is invited, and so on, until the event capacity is filled.  
C. District Engineering Inspiration winner (qualifies to compete for the award only), and  
D. District Rookie All Star winner (qualifies to compete for the award only).  
 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 137 of 164 The capacity of each District Championship is shown in Table 11 -5. Each District determines the number of 
teams that qualify for their District Championship. These limits are based on factors including but not limited 
to the total number of teams in the District, available venue capacity, etc.  
Table 11-5 2025 District Championship Capacities  
District Championship  Capacity Divisions  
FIRST Chesapeake District Championship  54 1

New England District Championship  96 2 
Pacific Northwest District Championship  50 1 
Peachtree District State Championship  45 1 
11.3 District Championships with Multiple Divisions  
If a District Championship has too many teams to allow all teams 12 Qualification MATCHES , then the event 
hosts multiple divisions. These events have 2 or 4 divisions (based on the number of teams participating, see Table 11 -5) with approximately 40 –60 teams in each division. Teams are assigned divisions by FIRST using a 
process developed by FIRST  in Michigan  and balances  need for accessible seating between Divisions .  
The process employs a “brute force iterative randomizer” and is executed as follows:  
1. The district team list is sorted in order of cumulative district points earned as described in section 11.1  
District Events . 
2. The list is divided into quartiles based on rank (e.g. the first quartile has the top 25% ranked teams).  If 
the total number of teams is not evenly divisible by 4 times the number of divisions, additional teams are distributed to quartiles 4, then 2, then 3.  
3. Division assignments are randomly generated using equal contributions  from each quartile.  
4. 3 criteria are calculated for each division:  
a. average strength: the arithmetic mean of the district point values of teams in a division  
b. distribution of strength: the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the district point values of teams in a division. SNR is calculated as follows:  
𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆=1 0 �log10𝑥𝑥̅2
𝜎𝜎2� 
 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 138 of 164 𝑥𝑥̅ = arithmetic mean of the district points in a division  
σ = standard deviation of the district points in a division  
c. distribution of strength for “top” teams: The SNR of the district point values of teams in the first 
quartile of a division  
5. The 3 criteria for each division are compared to the other division(s). If the difference between the division’s value and any other division’s value exceeds the limits in Table 11 -6, the criteria is not met.  
Table 11-6 District Championship division e valuation limits  
 2 divisions 4 divisions 
Average strength  1 2 
Distribution of strength  1 2.5 
Distribution of strength for “top” teams  1.5 2 
6. If all 3 criteria met, event organizers publish the assignments. If any of the 3 criteria are not met, assignments are rejected, and the process returns to Step 3.  
11.4 District Championship Playoffs

− For a 4 -Division District Championship Playoff tournament, each team on a Champion ALLIANCE earns 
20 points and each team on a Finalist ALLIANCE  receives 10 points.  
− If any of these ALLIANCES  has recruited a BACKUP TEAM, these points are divided amongst the teams 
as described in section 11.1.3  Playoff Performance . 

 
Section 11 District Tournaments  V3 140 of 164 − If an ALLIANCE  in a District Championship Playoff has not yet recruited a BACKUP TEAM  per section 
10.6.3 BACKUP TEAMS , the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  may bring in only the highest ranked team from their 
division’s BACKUP POOL  to join its ALLIANCE. 
11.5 FIRST  Championship Eligibility  
Each District determines the number of Dean’s List Finalists, FIRST Impact Awards, Rookie All Star Awards, and 
Engineering Inspiration Awards to present at their District Championship, within a range established by FIRST. 
The team counts are based on the team representation of the respective District at the Championship. For the awards, ranges are developed by using ratios agreed upon by FIRST and District Leadership. These ranges 
allow each District to represent their own community as they see fit.  
• For the FIRST  Impact Award, the ratios range from one FIRST Impact Award team for every 18 
Championship District teams to one FIRST  Impact Award team for every nine Championship District 
teams.  
• For the Dean’s List Finalist Award, the ratios range from one Dean’s List Finalist for every nine Championship District teams to one Dean’s List Finalist for every six Championship District teams.  
• All Districts, regardless of FIRST Championship Slot allocation, may award one or two Engineering 
Inspiration and Rookie All- Star Awards.  
The following teams competing in the District model earn a Merit -Based Qualifying slot:  
• District Championship  
o FIRST Impact Award Winners  
o Engineering Inspiration Award Winners  
o Rookie All -Star Winners (the judges can decide if they present this award or not)  
o Winning Alliance members  
• as many teams in District -points total order to fill the Allocated FIRST Championship slots granted per 
the table below.  
Districts receive the percentage of 'available slots' at FIRST Championship, rounded up to the nearest whole 
slot, equal to the percentage of teams they have in their District compared to the total of all FIRST Robotics 
Competition teams. 'Available slots' are calculated by taking the total number of slots at FIRST Championship 
and subtracting the number of pre -qualified teams. This overall calculation uses a ‘snapshot’ of teams that 
have registered and paid as of three weeks after initial season payment wa s due.

Section 12 Regional Tournaments  V3 143 of 164 12 Regional Tournaments  
Teams advance through the season depending on the events at which they compete: Regional or District. This 
section details how Regional teams advance from Regional  events to FIRST Championship.  
12.1 Regional Events  
Regional  teams are ranked throughout the season based on the points they earn at the first 2 Regional  events 
they attend. Points are awarded to teams as follows:  
Table  12-1 Regional Point Assignment  
Category  Points

(For a Regional  event, this will result in a minimum of 3 points being awarded for 
Qualification round performance. For events of all sizes, a maximum of 22 points will be awarded.)  See section 11.1.1  Qualification Round Performance  for details.  
ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  Equal to 17 minus the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  number (e.g. 14 points for ALLIANCE  #3 
Captain.) See section 11.1.2 ALLIANCE Selection Results for details.  
Draft Order Acceptance  Equal to 17 minus the Draft Order Acceptance Number (e.g. 12 points for the team that 
accepts the fifth draft position, regardless of whether it was delayed per T605 .)  
Playoff Advancement  Points awarded based on team participation in individual playoff rounds, and whether or not the ALLIANCE advances. See section  11.1.3 Playoff Performance  for details.  
Judged Team Awards  45 points for FIRST Impact Award  
28 points for Engineering Inspiration Award 
8 points for  Rookie All Star Award  
5 points each for all other judged team awards  
See section 12.1.1  Awards  for full details.  
Team Age  10 points for 2025  rookie teams 
5 points for 202 4 rookie teams  
See section 12.1.2  Team Age  for full details.  
If there is a tie in the event  point total between teams, the higher ranked team will be determined using the 
following additional sorting criteria:

7th Random Selection  
12.1.1  Awards  
This attribute measures team performance with respect to team awards judged at the event.   
Much of what is stated in s ection 11.1.4  Awards  is also relevant to Regional events . Points are assigned to 
awards to recognize that FIRST continues to be “More than Robots®” and to elevate award -winning teams 
above non -award- winning teams in the ranking system. These points are not intended to capture the true value 
of these awards as that value is truly immeasurable.  
Point values for some culture awards  (FIRST Impact Award, Engineering Inspiration) are higher for Regional 
events than District events  because Districts reward those teams with slots at an intermediate level of 
competition: their D istrict Championship. Regional teams do not have an intermediate competition level and 
FIRST wants those teams to have an opportunity to share their stories and celebrate their success outside of 
their regional event.  
12.1.2  Team Age  
This attribute recognizes the difficulty in being a rookie or relatively new team.  
Much of what is stated in s ection  11.1.5  Team Age  is also relevant to Regional events . Points are awarded to 
2024 and 2025 rookie teams . Unlike in the District events  where these points are awarded once per season, for 
Regional events these points are awarded at each event they attend. Awarding these points at every event will 
assist rookies with earning one of the three per -event qualification slots starting in 2026. Rookie year is 
calculated based on the year in which FIRST recognizes the team as a rookie.  
12.2 FIRST  Championship Eligibility  
A team competing in a Regional in 2025 qualifies for the FIRST Championship by meeting 1 of the following 
criteria:  
A. Regional FIRST  Impact Award Winner,  
B. Regional Engineering Inspiration Winner,  
 
Section 12 Regional Tournaments  V3 145 of 164 C. Winning Alliance: Captain , 
D. Winning Alliance: 1st Pick , or 
E. Invited from the Regional Pool  
12.3 Regional Pool  
All Regional event  teams not already qualified for the FIRST Championship are ranked together in the “Regional 
Pool” based on the points earned from their first two regional events. This list helps ensure the top performing 
teams across events qualify for the FIRST Championship and allows for the consideration of performance 
across multiple events for teams. Awarding points at the first  two events , with a projection  if a team has only 
played one event , reward s consistent performance over the season without being punitive to single -event 
teams.  
The global Regional Rankings webpage  shows all regional teams in rank order by their assigned points. Teams 
are invited to the FIRST Championship from the Regional Pool on a weekly basis beginning after Week 2.  
Our goal is to release enough slots each week so that the same proportion of Championship slots have been 
filled as events have been completed. For example, 47 of 69 (~68%) Regional Events will be completed after Week 4, and we plan to have approximately t he same percentage of Regional slots filled by that point as well.  
12.3.1  Single -event team points calculation  
If a team has only played one event at the end of the interval, they are awarded second event points using this formula:  
𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟  𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃 =0.6∗(𝑜𝑜𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐  𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑃𝑃 )+14 
This model is based on a regression of Event 1 vs Event 2 points in 202 3 and 202 4. This calculation projects 
how many points would be earned by the average team who earned X points at their first event.  If the result is 
not a whole number, the value is rounded to the nearest integer . 


 
Section 13 FIRST Championship Tournament (C)  V0 147 of 164 13 FIRST  Championship  Tournament  (C) 
At the 2025  FIRST Championship  presented by BAE Systems, teams are split into 8 divisions. The process 
used to assign teams to their division is as follows:  
1. Teams requesting accessible seating are split amongst the division s. 
2. Rookies are random ized and then assigned sequentially to divisions , skipping a division for each rookie 
assigned in Step 1 (i.e. a team in Division 1, a team in Division 2, a team in Division 3, a team in Division 
4, a team in Division 5, a team in Division 6, a team in Division 7, a team in Division 8, then back to 
Division 1 again, until Rookies are all assigned to a divisi on).  
3. Step 2 is repeated with veteran teams , with additional assignments as necessary to balance the total 
teams in each division . 
Each division plays a standard tournament as described in section 10.5  Qualification MATCHES  and section 
10.6  Playoff MATCHES  to produce the division Champions. Those 8 division Champions proceed to the 
Championship Playoffs, on the Einstein FIELDS , to determine the 2025  FIRST Robotics Competition 
Championship Winners, per s ection 13.4 FIRST Championship Playoffs . 
13.1 Advancement to the FIRST  Championship  
Details on how teams earn eligibility to attend the FIRST Championship can be found in section 11.5  FIRST 
Championship Eligibility  and s ection 12.2  FIRST Championship Eligibility . Teams that are pre -qualified can be 
found on the FIRST Championship eligibility webpage . 
13.2 4-ROBOT  ALLIANCES 
There is no provision for BACKUP TEAMS at the FIRST Championship.  
Instead, before each division Playoff Tournament, ALLIANCES are selected per the process as described in 
section 10.6.1 ALLIANCE Selection Process , however the process continues with a third round of selection as 
follows.  
Round 3: The same method is used for each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S  third choice except the selection order is 
reversed again, with ALLIANCE 1 picking first and ALLIANCE 8 picking last. This process results in 8 
ALLIANCES of 4 teams each.  
ALLIANCES may start with any 3 of the 4 ROBOTS  on their ALLIANCE during division Playoff MATCHES  and 
during the Championship Playoffs. ALLIANCES submit LINEUPS for their MATCHES  as described in s ection 
10.6.4 LINEUPS . 
13.3 FIRST  Championship Pit Crews  
FIRST distributes buttons to the ALLIANCE CAPTAINS  during the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN  meeting, which takes 
place on the division FIELDS . These buttons provide the necessary access to the ARENA  for pit crew members.  
C301  *Wear your buttons.  Only team members  wearing proper buttons are allowed on the ARENA  floor 
during division and Playoff MATCHES . 
Violation: MATCH  won’t start until the situation is corrected. Those not displaying identification must 
leave the ARENA . 
Teams should assume they may be chosen for an ALLIANCE and think about the 
logistics of button distribution and set a plan prior to the ALLIANCE selection 
 
Section 13 FIRST Championship Tournament (C)  V0 148 of 164 process. It is each ALLIANCE CAPTAIN’S  responsibility to distribute buttons to 
their pit crew members.  
13.4 FIRST  Championship Playoffs  
The 8 division Champions play a Double Elimination style tournament as described in s ection 10.6  Playoff 
MATCHES  to determine the 2025 FIRST  Robotics Competition Champions. Exact MATCH  timing is provided to 
FIRST Championship Playoff teams. ALLIANCES  are paired as shown in Figure 13 -1. 
Figure 13-1 FIRST  Championship playoff bracket  
 
During the Einstein Finals, if the MATCH  score of each ALLIANCE is equal, the MATCH  is replayed. In this 
circumstance, the LINEUP  may be changed.  

 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 149 of 164 14 Event Rules  (E) 
FIRST is committed to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and as such, FIRST strives to make  reasonable 
accommodations for persons with disabilities that request accommodation. If a participant needs an 
accommodation for an event, please talk to a volunteer at the event or contact your local leadership before the event so they can help ensure the accommodation is provided. Local leadership may make exceptions to event rules to allow for reasonable accommodations given the exceptions do not create an undue hardship or cause safety concerns.  
Rules around safety and security within this section are minimum requirements, and Program Delivery Partners are able to implement increased restrictions due to local or venue requirements (e.g. requiring badging for all attendees, reserving seating for ac cessibility, etc.). Partners should communicate additional local 
requirements early enough to allow teams to plan.  
Safety is always paramount, and many rules are intended to establish norms at 
each event that will mitigate injury risk to all participants.  
Event staff have the final decision authority for all safety -related issues within a 
venue.  
14.1 General Rules 
The rules below apply throughout an event, i.e. from when Load- In begins to when Load -Out is complete.  
Universal Violation Note: A violation of any Event Rule will result in a VERBAL WARNING . Egregious or 
subsequent violations will be addressed by the Head REFEREE, the Lead Robot INSPECTOR  (LRI) and/or 
Event Management. Teams should note that egregious and frequent violations may be shared with the Judge Advisor which could lead to disqualification from awards.  
Additional rule specific violations, if applicable, are listed with their corresponding rule.  
E101 *Personal safety comes first.  All team members must observe the following safety practices 
throughout the event:  
A. wear safety glasses (only ANSI- approved, UL Listed, CE EN166 rated, AS/NZS certified, or CSA 
rated non -shaded) while in and around the playing FIELD and in the pit area. Lightly tinted lenses 
are permitted provided eyes are clearly visible to others, but r eflective lenses are prohibited. 
Accommodations will be made for participants that require tinted safety glasses. The only exception is for teams in their first 10 minutes of their load in and for the first 10 minutes pits are open each day of the event as  long as they’re not working on the ROBOT or setting up their 
pit. 
B. wear closed toed/heeled shoes.  
C. tie back long hair while working on or around a ROBOT or ROBOT related materials.  
D. wear appropriate clothing.  
E. walk in the venue.  
F. health and safety requirements in place for that event (e.g. mask wearing).  
For more information about safety at FIRST Robotics Competition events, please 
reference the Safety Manual . 
E102 *Be nice. All participants must be gracious and professional at all times while attending FIRST Robotics 
Competition events. Uncivil behavior toward any participants is not tolerated.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 150 of 164 Examples of inappropriate behavior include, but are not limited to 
A. use of offensive language or other uncivil conduct,   
B. intentionally blocking the view of other participants or spectators for an 
extended period (team members momentarily holding up team signs while 
directly supporting their team is not considered a violation of this rule.), and  
C. jamming or interfering with the remote sensing capabilities of a ROBOT or the 
FIELD while in open -access spectator seating areas.  
Examples of remote sensing capabilities include, but are not limited to, vision 
systems, acoustic range finders, sonars, and infrared proximity sensors.  
Use of imagery that, to a reasonably astute observer, mimics the AprilTags  
employed on the FIELD is a violation of this rule.  
Examples of particularly contemptible behavior that may result in ejection from 
the event include, but are not limited to, the following:  
A. assault, e.g. throwing something that hits another person (even if 
unintended),  
B. threat, e.g. saying something like “if you don’t reverse that call, I’ll make you 
regret it,”  
C. harassment, e.g. badgering someone with no new information after a 
decision’s been made or a question’s been answered,  
D. bullying, e.g. using body or verbal language to cause another person to feel 
inadequate,  
E. insulting, e.g. telling someone they don’t deserve to be on a team,  
F. swearing at another person (versus swearing under one’s breath or at 
oneself), and  
G. yelling at another person(s) in anger or frustration.  
E103 *Children with adults, please. Children under 12 must be accompanied in the pits by an adult at all 
times.  
E104 *Respect the venue. Teams may not damage the venue, including but not limited to bleachers, floors, 
walls, railings, etc., in any way.  
E105 *Teams must check in. An adult team member must check in at the Pit Administration station no later 
than 90 minutes before Qualification MATCHES are scheduled to start.  
Violation: Teams will be contacted in their pit. Failure to Check -In may result in a team not participating in 
the event.  
Event check -in takes place at the Pit Administration station the evening before 
and/or the first morning of each event.  
Once a team’s consent and release forms are submitted at Pit Administration, 
each team will receive their DRIVE TEAM & Safety Captain buttons.  
E106 *Some event resources for event teams only.  Only teams registered for an event may use that event’s 
Competition FIELD, Practice Field , Spare Parts, Machine Shop, and Inspection. Host teams supplying 
Practice Field elements and/or Machine Shop resources may use them, however teams registered for 
that event must be granted priority.  
E107 *Work in designated areas only.  At the event venue, teams may only produce FABRICATED ITEMS as 
follows:  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 151 of 164 A. in their pit area,  
B. in another team’s pit area with permission from that team,  
C. while queued for a MATCH or Practice Field (given space constraints, extra scrutiny regarding 
safety is required),  
D. any area designated by Event Staff (e.g. Playoff Pit Area, etc.), or  
E. as permitted at provided machine shops that are available to all teams.  
E108 *Some things don’t belong at events.  Do not bring or use the following:  
A. skateboards 
B. ‘hoverboards’  
C. drones  
D. bottled gas tanks (e.g. helium)  
E. noisy devices or noisemakers, such as floor stompers, whistles and/or air horns  
F. walkie -talkies  
G. scooters, except for those used for accommodations  
E109 *Don’t arrange for additional utilities.  Do not arrange for power, internet access, or phone lines from 
venue service providers or attempt to use venue internet connections reserved for event purposes (e.g. 
the FIELD Management System or web casting).  
E110 *Don’t sell stuff.  Teams may not conduct sales at an event. This includes, but is not limited to, raffle 
tickets, food, hats, shirts, candy, water, soft drinks, fruit, or any promotional products.  
E111 *Don’t give out food.  Teams may not distribute food to others at an event.  
E112 *Make FIRST  loud, but with restrictions.  Do not invite or bring live bands to play in the audience. Do not 
play loud music.  
E113 *Hang banners with care.  Be respectful when hanging your banners.  
A. Do not cover or move other team or sponsor signs already in place.  
B. Share the available space fairly with other teams.  
C. Do not obstruct the view of spectators.  
D. Get permission from the Event Coordinator before hanging  banners  outside of your pit.  
E. Hang signs and banners in a safe manner.  
F. Banners hung outside team pits must not be larger than 25 ft.2 (2.3 m2).  
We encourage teams to bring team flags and/or signs for display in their pits 
and/or the playing FIELD area.  
To find your Event Coordinator, inquire at the Pit Administration desk.  
Respect venue -specific rules regarding sign location and hanging methods. At 
the end of the event, safely remove all signs and anything used to hang the signs 
(tape, string, etc.).  
E114 *Limit flag and flagpole size. Flags  and flagpoles  may not be of unreasonable size and weight.   
As a guideline, r easonable flags are less than 3 ft. by 5 ft. (~91 cm by 152 cm) in 
size and weigh less  than 2 lbs . (~907g) . Reasonable flagpoles may not be more 
than 8 ft. ( ~243 cm) long and weigh  less than 3 lbs . (~1360g ). 
E115 *No firearms.  Firearms are prohibited at all FIRST events for all FIRST programs, including without 
limitation, all official FIRST  Events posted here . This policy does not apply to law enforcement or venue 
security personnel.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 152 of 164 E116 *Only COTS batteries allowed . Teams may only bring COTS batteries to events . Output wires or 
connectors may be modified as long as no safety systems are compromised.  
Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in the batteries.  
E117 *Enter only 1 ROBOT. Each registered FIRST  Robotics Competition team may enter only 1 ROBOT (or  
“robot,” a ROBOT -like assembly equipped with most of its drive base, i.e. its MAJOR MECHANISM that 
enables it to move around a FIELD) into a 2025 FIRST Robotics Competition Event.  
“Entering” a ROBOT  (or robot ) into a FIRST Robotics Competition means bringing 
it to or using it at the event such that it’s an aid to your team (e.g. for spare parts, 
judging material, or for practice).  
While “most of its drive base” is a subjective assessment, for the purposes of 
this rule, an assembly whose drive base is missing all wheels/treads, gearboxes, 
and belts/chains is not considered a “ ROBOT .” If any of those COMPONENTS are 
incorporated, the assembly is now considered a “ ROBOT.”  
This rule does not prohibit teams from bringing in ROBOTS  from other FIRST 
programs for the purposes of awards presentations or pit displays.  
 
14.2 Machine Shops  
Some events host a machine shop, open during specific hours (see the event’s agenda), to help teams with 
repair and fabrication of their ROBOT. Machine shops are typically sponsored by NASA or local organizations. While the machine shops vary, FIRST strives to have welding and a variety of high -powered tools available at all 
events.  
In most cases, the machine shop is on site and readily accessible to all teams. If a team attends an event where the Machine Shop is off -site, volunteers are in place to transport the ROBOT or parts to and from the 
machine shop. In this case, a team fills out a Machine Shop Request Form that travels with the ROBOT or 
parts, so the machine shop staff and volunteers can follow their directions. The event should set up a method of communication between the venue and off -site machine shop in case there are any questions.  
E201 *The ROBOT goes alone to off- site machine shops.  Team members may not travel to off -site machine 
shops with the ROBOT being transported by volunteers.  
Teams may travel to the off -site machine shop on their own, either by walking or 
using their own vehicle, but all STUDENT  team members must be accompanied 
by an adult at all times. Teams should strongly consider including a third team 
member per the FIRST  Youth Protection Program guidelines . 
14.3 Wireless Rules  
E301 *No wireless communication.  Teams may  not set up their own 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax /be wireless 
communication (e.g. access points or ad -hoc networks) in the venue.  
A wireless hot spot created by a cellular device, camera, smart TV, etc. is 
considered an access point.  
Some smart TVs have access points enabled by factory default. Please make 
sure that functionality is disabled for any TVs brought to the event. 
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 153 of 164 E302 *Don’t interfere with wireless networks. Participants may not interfere, attempt to interfere, or attempt 
to connect with any other team or FIRST wireless communication except as expressly allowed for 
purposes of communicating with their team’s ROBOT on the FIELD or Practice Field .  
Teams are encouraged to report suspected wireless security vulnerabilities to 
the FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA) if at the event or to FIRST via 
customerservice@firstinspires.org .  
Violation: Subsequent violations may lead to dismissal from event and/or legal action based on applicable 
laws.  
E303 *Tethered operation outside FIELDS/Practice Fields . ROBOTS may only be operated by tether when 
outside the FIELD or Practice Field . 
14.4 Load -In 
Events set specific time frames, published on the event’s schedule, in which teams are invited to load their ROBOT and equipment into their pit areas before pits officially open.  
Load -In can be stressful for teams and volunteers, which can be mitigated by preparation and planning. 
Unanticipated factors, like traffic or weather, can change a team’s scheduled arrival time, making the process difficult. The most important things a tea m should remember are to be safe, gracious, and professional. 
Teams who experience smooth and easy Load -Ins are encouraged to check with others to see if they can help 
and make their experience as positive as possible.  
E401 *Load in during Load -In. Teams may not bring the ROBOT or ROBOT elements into the event after the 
designated Load -In period. Exceptions are as follows:  
A. exceptions listed in R304 
B. raw stock  
C. COTS items  
D. gearboxes attached to associated motor(s)  
E. assembled wheels  
F. exceptional circumstances that result in a team not being able to make the Load -In time and 
has made arrangements with Event Management.  
There are no rules that explicitly restrict items that may be brought into the venue 
during the designated Load -In period.  
If an event does not have a designated  Load -In period on its Public Schedule, the 
designated Load -In period begins when pits open and ends when opening 
ceremonies start.  
During Load -In, teams are not limited to a single trip, and are encouraged to be as 
efficient and safe as possible.  
Violation: Item will not be permitted into venue.  
E402 *Load -In person limit is 5. Only 5 team members (one of which must be an adult) may be in the pit area 
during any Load -In period prior to pits opening.  
Violation: Extra team members must leave the venue.  
E403 *Load -In Restrictions. The only team permitted activities during load in are:  
A. bring ing materials into their pit area.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 154 of 164 B. ROBOT and BUMPER  weighing (if available at your event) , including any necessary BUMPER 
installation or removal  
C. Early Pit Setup (if available at your event)  
Violation: Teams will be asked to leave the pit area.  
E404 *Pit must be left in a safe state. Teams must have their pits in a safe state by the time pits close (even 
if some tasks are left undone).  
E405 *Once done, head out. Unless assisting other teams per the introductory language in this section, 
teams must leave the venue once finished delivering materials (or, in the case of Early Pit Setup, when 
setup is complete).  
If an event has designated Early Pit Setup times both the evening before and the 
morning before pits officially open, a team may use both periods for Load -In and 
setup, but per this rule must leave once pit setup is complete.  
Violation: Teams will be asked to leave the pit area.  
14.5 Pits 
A team pit is the designated space, usually 10 ft. by 10 ft. by 10 ft. (~3 m x 3 m x 3 m), where a team may work on their ROBOT. Each team is assigned a pit space marked with their team number. This helps team members, judges, and visitors find teams easil y. Each team pit has a power  outlet  and a table may be provided . 
Teams, volunteers, FIRST  staff, and guests spend a lot of time in the pits. Get to know other teams and help 
each other when you can. Time is short and help is very often right "next door" in the adjacent team pits.  
Small, bench -top machinery, with appropriate guards, is permitted in team pits. ‘Small’ machinery is machinery 
that can be easily lifted by one person and examples include, but are not limited to, small band saws, drill presses, desktop CNC mills, and sand ers. 
E501 *Pits are unavailable if closed.  Teams may not be in their team pit outside the designated pit hours.  
E502 *Stay in your pit.  Teams may neither allow their materials to expand beyond their team pit (including 
running power or internet lines from their team pit to any other area), swap team pits with other teams, nor move themselves to empty team pits.  
E503 *Keep aisles clear. Aisles must be kept clear.  
E504 *No sparks.  Tools that throw sparks or produce open flames are prohibited.  
Examples of tools that violate this rule include, but are not limited to, welders, 
bench and angle grinders, gas torches, etc.  
E505 *Nothing too big.  Floor standing power tools are prohibited.  
Examples include but are not limited to full- size drill presses, band saws, and 
table saws.  
Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in floor standing power tools. Any items that are deemed unsafe or outside specifications by FIRST  personnel, event management, and/or local committee 
members must be removed.  
E506 *No brazing or welding. Brazing/welding is prohibited.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 155 of 164 Violation: Teams will be asked to remove or not bring in brazing/welding tools. Any items that are deemed 
unsafe or outside specifications by FIRST  personnel, event management, and/or local committee 
members must be removed.  
E507 *Solder with specific tools only.  Soldering may be done using an electric iron/gun only.  
Violation: Any items that are deemed unsafe or outside specifications by FIRST personnel, event 
management, and/or local committee members must be removed.  
E508 *Structures must be safe. Teams may not build any structure that supports people or stores items 
overhead.  
Violation: Any pit structures that is deemed unsafe or outside specifications by FIRST personnel, event 
management, and/or local committee members must be removed.  
E509 *Secure team identification assets.  Team signs, flags, and displays must be securely mounted to the 
pit structure.  
Violation: Any pit structures that is deemed unsafe or outside specifications by FIRST personnel, event 
management, and/or local committee members must be removed.  
14.6 Practice Areas 
FIRST  Robotics Competition P ractice Areas are intended to allow teams to interact with representative FIELD  
elements and to test their starting AUTO  modes, they are not designed for multiple SCORING ELEMENT  AUTO  
modes or full FIELD  play. Although some Practice Fields may provide more space for additional strategy 
development, ample space for long full FIELD  interaction should not be expected.  FIRST provides a 
recommended layout, but events may need to tweak exact placement depending on the space available in the venue.  Teams should not relocate elements from th eir original locations. The layout is specifically intended to 
discourage testing of complex AUTO routines.  
Practice Fields are tether -only except for some District Championships and FIRST Championship  which may 
choose to run a full Field Management System on a Practice Field.  For events that have full FIELDS but are 
using tether , teams should expect that 2 teams are allowed on half the field at a time. Practice Field 
Attendants may allow additional teams provided teams are a safe distance from one another.  
FIRST is providing a small set of production run AprilTags for the Practice Field. The tags provided for the 2025 
Practice Field will include tags 1, 3, 5, and 6. Teams that wish to use other AprilTag IDs for the Practice Fields 
may print copies of other tags t o bring with them to events  but should not remove the provided tags . Printable 
copies of the field AprilTag s can be found  on the 2025 Playing FIELD webpage . 
FIRST is also providing a minimum of one “crosshatch” pattern ALGAE which is representative of the ALGAE 
used on the competition FIELD. Teams may not damage or remove it from the Practice Areas, as the supply is 
limited. Additional crosshatch ALGAE may be available depending on supply. CORAL is not provided and if a team wishes to practice with CORAL, they must bring their own.  
HUMAN PLAYERS are welcome to practice throwing ALGAE into the Practice Field NET as long as the area around the BARGE is clear of other ROBOTS and humans to avoid missed shots hitting people or interfering with ROBOT testing. Priority is given to ROBOT pra ctice over HUMAN PLAYER practice. Teams choosing to 
practice throwing ALGAE must bring their own ALGAE; the provided ALGAE are for ROBOT use only.  
E601 *Inspection for Practice Fields.  A team  may only use the designated event practice areas with a 
ROBOT that has passed an initial, complete inspection.  
E602 *Practice only when/where permitted. Teams may only practice with their ROBOT in their pit space, in 
the designated event practice areas, or while in a Practice MATCH.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 156 of 164 Teams may not set up their own practice equipment outside their pit. When 
practicing in their pit, safety must remain the top priority. If Event Management 
determines a pit practice setup is unsafe or interferes with activity in adjacent 
pits or aisles, th e team must discontinue the activity.  
E603 Practice Field  attendance is limited . Only team members actively working on the ROBOT are allowed to 
be on the Practice Field.  
The intent of this rule is to limit the number of people directly next to ROBOTS 
that are enabled. The recommendation is no more than 5 members per team , but 
some events may limit further due to available space.  
Teams may have additional team members watching from a distance , provided 
the venue has space, but those members should be a safe distance from all 
ROBOTS  operating at the Practice Field . 
E604 Give ROBOTS space.  When using a tether on Practice Fields, teams m ust keep a safe distance from all 
ROBOTS  and moving e lements and must  not interact directly with the ROBOT  when it is enabled.  
Generally , a safe distance is ~6’ (~182 cm) from the ROBOT.  
E605 Be ready to DISABLE . Teams must be ready to DISABLE their ROBOT  if the ROBOT does not move in 
the de sired direction or in case of safety.  
E606 Be safe . G102 and G103  also apply at the P ractice Field (s).  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING . Practice Field  suspension if subsequent violations during the event.  
14.7 ROBOT Carts  
Most teams use carts to transport their ROBOT throughout an event. Carts are not required but are strongly 
recommended (to minimize risk of muscle strains, dropped ROBOTS, and other hazards). In addition to the rules listed below, teams are strongly encour aged to put the team’s number on the cart, refer to the FIRST  
Safety Manual  for ROBOT lifting techniques, and practice putting the ROBOT on and off the cart to develop a 
safe, quick, fluid routine.  
E701 *Carts must be safe and easy to use.  Carts must be easy to control, maneuver, and pose no risk to 
bystanders.  
E702 *Carts shouldn’t be too big.  Carts must fit through a standard 30 -inch door.  
E703 *Carts can’t park anywhere. Carts must remain in the team pit (or cart staging area if during a MATCH) 
when not in use.  
E704 *No noisy carts.  Carts may not be equipped with music or other sound -generating devices, except for 
devices of reasonable volume used for safety purposes (e.g. to make others in the vicinity aware that a ROBOT is on the move).  
E705 *No motor  driven carts.  ROBOT carts may not use powered propulsion.   
E706 *Small ROBOT  carts are allowed on the FIELD . ROBOT cart s smaller than 2 ft 6 in.  (~76 cm)  by 3 ft. 
(~91 cm)  may be brought  onto the FIELD to aid in staging and retrieving the  ROBOT provided they are 
not left unattended and do not pose any other safety hazards.  
 
Section 14 Event Rules (E)  V5 157 of 164 14.8 Ceremonies  
At every event, there are Opening and Closing Ceremonies to show honor and respect for represented 
countries, sponsors, teams, mentors, volunteers, and award winners. Ceremonies provide everyone with the opportunity to collectively applaud the successes of  all participants. They also give teams a chance to "meet" 
the volunteers and other people and sponsors involved with the event. Closing Ceremony elements at the end of the event are integrated into and presented between Playoff Matches.  
At the Awards Ceremony, FIRST presents trophies and medallions to outstanding teams. All team members 
are encouraged to attend the ceremonies, be punctual, and show appreciation to volunteers that staffed the event.  
E801 *If in the pits during Ceremonies, shhhhhh.  During Ceremonies  outside of Playoff MATCHES , team 
members may not:  
A. use power tools 
B. use loud hand tools (hammers, saws, etc.)  
C. shout, yell, or use loud voices, unless as a demonstration of approval during a ceremonial activity.  
E802 *Pit person limit during Ceremonies is 5. No more than 5 team members may be in the pits during 
Ceremonies  outside of Playoff MATCHES . 
E803 *Be respectful during anthems. Team members, including any remaining in the pits, should exhibit 
peaceful behavior during the presentation of all national anthems. Traditionally, team members stand to face the flag, remove hats, and either sing along or maintain a respectful silence du ring the anthems 
of all nations present at the event. If team members wish to abstain, they have a right to do so, as long as they remain silent and non- disruptive.  
14.9 In the Stands  
E901 *No saving seats.  Teams are not permitted to save or designate seats for team members that are not 
present.  
Teams may not hang banners or ribbons or otherwise designate seating. (Event 
staff will remove and discard any banners, roping, etc., used to designate 
seating.) Please take turns sitting in the bleachers/stands if seating is limited. If 
there is a crowdin g problem, we ask that you kindly leave after your team's 
MATCH and return later, if possible.  
Event management may reserve seats for attendees who require 
accommodations.  
E902 *Don’t throw items from the stands. Items may not be thrown from audience seating .
