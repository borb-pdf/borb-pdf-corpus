                          How lipopolysaccharides bridge the gap
                                 The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipopolysaccharide, a large glycolipid that
                          prevents drugs from entering the cells. Disrupting lipopolysaccharide assembly hypersensitizes bacteria to antibiotics. 
                          Sherman et al. used biochemical tools to observe lipopolysaccharide transport. Seven proteins, which are conserved in                 Downloaded from 
                          all Gram-negative bacteria, appear to form a protein bridge that uses adenosine triphosphate to power transport of 
                          lipopolysaccharide from one membrane to another. The ability to monitor intermembrane transport of lipopolysaccharide
                          will help in efforts to develop and characterize inhibitors.
