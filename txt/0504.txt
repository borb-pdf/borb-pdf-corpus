               Ombudsman’s ifndings in relation to its maladministration with regard to Equitable Life;

               Lucy Powell
               That this House notes that state maintained nursery schools are at the forefront of 
               tackling low social mobility with 63 per cent graded outstanding by Ofsted, and 35 per 
               cent good; further notes that two thirds of maintained nursery schools are located in the 
               30 per cent most deprived areas in England; notes that maintained nursery schools are 
               recognised as being centres of excellence for supporting children with SEND in the early 
               years; notes that the whole early years sector beneifts from the expertise of maintained 
               nursery schools acting as catalysts to raise standards in their locality through supporting 
               schools and early years settings to work together to improve their quality; notes that 
               despite welcome transitionary funding the future viability of maintained nursery schools is 
               under threat with 12 closing since 2016; notes the loss of transitional funding is equivalent 
               to a 31 per cent cut in funding; and calls on the Government to safeguard the future 
               of these vital early years institutions by guaranteeing transitional funding after 2020 as 
               soon as possible whilst a long term plan to ensure their future viability is found by the 
               Comprehensive Spending Review.
