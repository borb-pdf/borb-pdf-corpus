          reader of international literature, Yu Hua explored many of these    their story to the wandering student. For Yu Hua and for Fugui, the
          literary devices. His short story, “The Past and the Punishments,” is
          an almost Kafkaesque attempt to explore the problem of historical
          memory in China in the aftermath of the Maoist excesses. Other
          short stories are remarkable for their striking and graphic depictions
          of violence.
              When Yu Hua turns to the novel, however, there is a notable
          change in his writing style. The language is spare but the story-
          telling becomes at once gentler, more first person, and more reveal-
          ing even though violence and tragedy are never far from the sur-
          face. Stories of life in China are told through families and across
          generations . . . across decades of history and across the political
          movements of the twentieth century. Yu Hua’s novels of life in
          rural China echo the familial sagas of Faulkner or Steinbeck in the
          American context. Yu Hua himself has indicated that the inspira-
          tion for To Live came from the American folk song entitled “Old
          Black Joe” about an elderly slave “who experienced a life’s worth
          of hardships, including the passing of his entire family—yet he still
          looked upon the world with eyes of kindness, offering not the
                              1
          slightest complaint.” The life of a black slave in antebellum Amer-
          ica and the life of a rural peasant in twentieth century China are
          worlds apart, yet there is a common theme of suffering and quiet
          nobility in struggling simply to survive and in discovering the small
          joys of shared life in the midst of recurring pains.
              Yu Hua’s title, To Live, is both a narrative statement and an
          exhortation. The novel is the story of a single family told through
          the eyes of Xu Fugui—a profligate son, an uncertain husband, an
          adoring father, and a doting grandfather—who lives to see every
          one of his family members die, leaving him utterly alone, finally to
