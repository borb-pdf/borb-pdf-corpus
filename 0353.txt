                SAFETY ASSESSMENT.
                The safety assessment requires the manufacturer to identify the potential hazards that a toy may present, 
                and to assess potential exposure to those hazards before the toy is put on the market. This is a mandatory 
                assessment according to the directive.

                 CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE.
                 Conformity assessment is the procedure by which a manufacturer establishes that his toy fulifls the essential 
                 safety requirements of the directive. Details as to who must undertake the procedure and how it is done are 
                 provided in the TSD. Conformity assessment can be carried out by one of two methods, depending upon the 
                 nature of the toy:

                                                                      In such cases a manufacturer submits a sample

                 toy. In this case, the manufacturer must apply the 
                 existing harmonised standards and ensure that the 
                 toy conforms to them. The manufacturer must also 
                 put in place an internal production procedure which 
                 does not require the involvement of a notiifed body.

                      WARNINGS.
                      General rules                                                                                           The manufacturer 
                      Where appropriate, warnings which specify user limitations need to accompany                            needs to mark the 
                      the toy for safer use. In addition to the mandatory requirements set out in the                        warnings in a clearly 
                      TSD, the harmonised standards also specify warnings that should accompany 
                      certain categories of toys. Within its territory, a Member State may stipulate that                    visible, easily legible 
                                                                                                                          and understandable and 
                      the warnings need to be written in a language or languages easily understood 
                      by consumers.                                                                                            accurate manner.
                      Location of warnings
                      Warnings must be marked on the toy, an afifxed label or the packaging, as deifned by the TSD and harmonised 
                      standards, and could also be required to be included in the instructions. It is important to note that in cases 
                      where the toy is sold without packaging, the warning needs to be afifxed on the toy itself. Afifxing warnings 
                      on a counter display box is not sufifcient to meet the requirements of the TSD. Warnings which determine the 
                      purchase decision, such as minimum and maximum user age indications and the speciifc warnings described 
                      in the directive, must appear on the consumer packaging or be otherwise clearly visible to the consumer before 
                      the purchase, even in cases where the purchase is made online.
                      Speciifc warnings
                      User limitations must contain at least the minimum or maximum age of the user. If appropriate, they must 
                      also contain the abilities or characteristics required by a user to be able to use the toy safely (e.g. ability to sit 
                      unaided, maximum and minimum weight of the user, need to use the toy under supervision). In order to indicate 
                      that a toy is not suitable for children under 36 months for safety reasons, manufacturers may choose between 
                      a warning phrase or pictogram (or both):
                                      Not suitable for children under 36 months.
                      In both cases the phrase and/or the pictogram must be preceded by the word “Warning” or “Warnings” as 
                      appropriate. 
                      The age warning alone is not sufifcient. It needs to be accompanied by a brief indication of the speciifc hazard 
                      calling for this precaution, which may appear in the instructions for use. The hazard is the potential source of 
                      harm. Harm means physical injury or any other damage to health, including long term health effect.
                      Examples of acceptable warnings, together with brief indications of the speciifc hazard and, in the second 
                      example, a clear description of the harm, are: 
                       “Warning. Not suitable for children under 36 months. Small parts” 
                       “Warning. Not suitable for children under 36 months. Long cord. Strangulation hazard”
                                                                                                                   25
                             TRACEABILITY.
                             Every manufacturer must ensure that their toy can be identiifed. This can be done by using a type, batch, serial/
                             model number or other element allowing the toy to be identiifed. The toy must also bear the manufacturer’s 
                             name, registered trade name/mark and address. 
                             A single contact point address for the manufacturer must also be provided. If the size or nature of the toy does 
                             not allow it to the identiifcation element and the manufacturer’s information, the manufacturer must place the 
                             required information on the packaging or in a document accompanying the toy. It is important to note that the 
                             single address at which the manufacturer can be contacted must be a street address or post box (a website 
                             will not be considered as a point of contact address). 
                                                                                                                   If an importer puts a toy on the

                                Before selling a toy, the manufacturer must draw 
                                up an EC declaration of conformity (DoC). By 
                                doing so, the manufacturer certiifes and assumes 
                                responsibility for the compliance of the toy with the 
                                essential requirements of the TSD (see page 5).

                                    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS).
                                       1              How can you determine whether a product is a toy or not? How can you distinguish a 
                                                      promotional product from a toy?
                                                      The deifnition of a toy in the Toy Safety Directive (TSD) must always be the basis for deciding whether 
                                                      a product is a toy or not. Annex I gives examples of products that are not considered as toys but 
                                                      could be confused with toys, but the list is naturally not exhaustive. However, if a particular product 
                                                      is not mentioned in the list, it does not mean that it is automatically a toy. To be considered as a toy 
                                                      for the purpose of the directive, the playing value has to be introduced in an intended way by the 
                                                      manufacturer. The declaration by the manufacturer of the intended use is a criterion to be considered 
                                                      since it ifgures in the wording itself, but the reasonable expected use is considered to prevail over the 
                                                      declaration of intended used by the manufacturer. If the manufacturer labels the product as not being 
                                                      a toy, he has to be able to support this claim.                                         Guidance document No 4   gives further indicative criteria 
                                                      that need to be considered for the classiifcation of a product as a toy. Furthermore, several guidance 
                                                      documents have been drafted for the classiifcation of speciifc products.
                                       2 What happens if an economic operator does not provide the required information to 
                                                      authorities?
                                                      If the required information is not available and/or provided, the market surveillance authority 
                                                      may require the toy to be tested by a notiifed body at the manufacturer’s own expense within a 
                                                      speciifed period in order to verify compliance with the harmonised standards and essential safety 
                                                      requirements. If non-compliance persists, the authority will take all appropriate measures to 
                                                      restrict or prohibit the toy being made available on the market, or will ensure that it is recalled or 
                                                      withdrawn from the market. Furthermore, if toy manufacturers, importers, and distributors do 
                                                      not fulifl the safety requirements of the directive, Member States can also impose penalties.                                                                                                    
                                       3 What should an economic operator do if he thinks a toy is not in conformity?
                                                      In this case, the TSD stipulates that ‘economic operators who consider or have reason to believe 
                                                      that a toy which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with the relevant Community 
                                                      harmonisation legislation should immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that toy 
                                                      into conformity, to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate’. It also requires that ‘when deemed appropriate 
                                                      with regard to the risks presented by a toy, economic operators should, to protect the health and 
                                                      safety of consumers, carry out sample testing of marketed toys, investigate, and, if necessary, keep a 
                                                      register of complaints, of non-conforming toys and toy recalls’.
                                       4 How can a manufacturer determine the age of the children its toys are intended for? Who 
                                                      controls the manufacturer’s decision?
                                                      The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) report CR 14379 Classiifcation of toys gives 
                                                      guidelines for matching toy characteristics to children’s ages. Although functions and characteristics 
                                                      and examples are listed in this report, some toys can give rise to discussion and Guidance document 
                                                      No11 (Toys intended for children above and under 36 months) details the classiifcation for children 
                                                      above and under 3 years of age. There is also the United States’ Consumer Product Safety Commission 
                                                      (CPSC)’s Age Determination Guidelines issued in 2002, the international ISO/TR 8124-8: 2014 on 
                                                      Age determination guidelines and other Eurguidance documentsopean Commission . The market 
                                                      surveillance authorities use the same guidelines to ensure conformity.
                                       5 If an economic operator changes a toy, can they be considered a manufacturer?
                                                      An importer or distributor who modiifes a product, and by doing so alters its compliance, assumes 
                                                      the obligations and responsibilities of the manufacturer and is responsible for the conformity of the 
                                                      product. He does not have to provide details to authorities unless requested but must ensure that 
                                                      he has up-to-date technical documentation which includes the changes made to the toy and the 
                                                      compliance of the new version of the toy.
                                                                  30
                  6 What information do manufacturers need to provide in the technical documentation to 
                         show conformity of the toy?
                         The technical documentation ifle should consist of the following elements, which prove that the toy is 
                         in conformity with the TSD and has undergone all the necessary assessments.

                         The European Commission’s website provides a template of a Declaration of Conformity (DoC) in 
                         all ofifcial European languages. Annex IV of the TSD lists all documents required for the technical 
                         documentation.
                  7      Is an importer who is obliged to attach instructions in the local language then considered 
                         to be the manufacturer?
                         The addition of labels to the retail pack does not constitute a modiifed product and thus the importer 
                         would not be considered a manufacturer. The importer is considered the manufacturer if they modify 
                         the toy in a way that affects compliance, e.g. changes in materials, colour, age grading, etc., or if it 
                         places a toy on the market under its name or trademark.
                  8 What type of economic operator is an importer that sells a batch of products to a 
                         distributor in the Far East?
                         According to the TSD, an importer means any natural or legal person established within the EU who 
                         places a toy from a third country on the EU market. As this action does not concern placing on the EU 
                         market, it is not subject to EU legislation.
                  9 Is a grandmother that buys a toy abroad and brings it into the EU an importer?
                         An importer (a person responsible for placing on the market), in the meaning of the New Approach 
                         Directives and as deifned in the TSD, is any natural or legal person established in the European Union 
                         who places a product from a third country on the EU market. Therefore, a private individual would only 
                         be considered an importer if they were to place the product bought abroad on the EU market.
                 10      What are the obligations for importers of second hand toys?
                         There is no text in the TSD that speciifcally covers second hand toys. The TSD covers toys placed on 
                         the EU market since 20 July 2011. If the second hand toy was placed on the EU market before that 
                         date, it is not covered by the TSD. However, if the toy comes from outside the EU and is introduced 
                         onto the EU market for the ifrst time, then the TSD is applicable. Importers of second hand toys have 
                         the same obligations as importers of other toys, there is no differentiation regarding the requirements 
                         for newly produced or used toys – both must have the relevant documentation and the necessary 
                         markings.
                                                                  31
                 11      How can we ensure that Chinese players in the supply chain meet the requirements? 
                         What are the responsibilities for the importer in the case of noncompliance?
                         Both the general explanatory guidance document and the guidance document on technical 
                         documentation are available in Chinese in the European Commission’s website, which should help 
                         Chinese economic operators to meet the requirements. An importer who considers or has reason 
                         to believe that a toy which they have placed on the market is not in conformity with the relevant EU 
                         legislation should immediately take the corrective measures necessary to bring that toy into conformity, 
                         to withdraw it or recall it, if appropriate. Furthermore, where the toy presents a risk, the importer should 
                         immediately inform the competent national authorities of the Member States in which they made 
                         the toy available. They must give details, in particular, of the noncompliance and of any corrective 
                         measures taken. The European Commission and Toy Industries of Europe also carry out many 
                         educational campaigns on the Toy Safety Directive in China to ensure that local economic operators 
                         are aware of and comply with the requirements.
                 12      If a company manufacturing a product abroad goes out of business, is the importer liable? 
                         What happens if the importer is formally requested to provide technical documentation 
                         but had no records because its supplier no longer existed?
                         The importer has a number of obligations and is therefore liable if he is not able to meet, inter alia, the 
                         following requirements. 
                         The importer must ensure that the manufacturer has the technical documentation and that it can 
                         be made available upon request, for ten years after the last toy has been placed on the market. The 
                         importer can do this by getting a declaration from the manufacturer saying that he has the technical 
                         documentation. If the importer previously visited the manufacturer, this will be in its records and can 
                         be used to prove their relationship to the enforcement body and to possibly disclaim any liability. If the 
                         technical documentation cannot be provided, it would be considered by the authorities as a formal 
                         non-compliance.
                         The importer must, further to a reasoned request from a competent national authority, provide that 
                         authority with all the information and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the 
                         toy in a language easily understood by that authority. They must cooperate with that authority, at 
                         its request, on any action taken to eliminate the risks posed by toys which they have placed on the 
                         market.  
                 13      Does an importer or distributor assume the responsibility for the translation of instructions?
                         According to the TSD, the importer should ensure that the toy is accompanied by instructions and 
                         safety information in a language or languages easily understood by consumers, as determined by the 
                         Member State concerned. Therefore, an importer or distributor does assume responsibility for the 
                         translation of instructions.
                 14      Is a distributor expected to make sure that the commercialised products bear the CE 
                         marking or warning pictograms?
                         The distributor should act with due care and have a basic knowledge of the applicable legal  
                         requirements. He should know, for instance, which pr  oducts must bear the CE marking, what 
                         information has to accompany the product, and what the language requirements for users’ instructions 
                         or other accompanying documents are. A distributor may not supply products that he knows or should 
                         have assumed, on the basis of available information and professional knowledge, do not comply with 
                         the legislation. A distributor should cooperate in actions taken to avoid or minimise the risk of non-
                         compliant toys reaching the market.
                                                                 32
                 15     How should the distributor ensure that the required documentation is available?
                        The distributor is not required to have the DoC or the technical documentation but must be able to, 
                        following a reasoned request from a competent authority, provide that authority with all the information 
                        and documentation necessary to demonstrate conformity of the toy. The distributor must also be able 
                        to identify the manufacturer, his authorised representative (if any), the importer or the person who has 
                        provided him with the product in order to assist the surveillance authority in its efforts to receive the 
                        DoC and the necessary parts of the technical documentation.
                 16     Regarding the obligations of the distributor and speciifcally Article 7, paragraph 2 of the 
                        TSD, what are the ‘required documents’?
                        When making a toy available on the market, the distributor must ensure that the toy bears the 
                        appropriate conformity marking(s) and is accompanied by the required documents, instructions and 
                        safety information in the appropriate language. ‘Required documents’ refers to all documents that 
                        must accompany the toy itself. According to the TSD, these documents are the safety information, 
                        instructions and the warnings. The distributor must also ensure that the manufacturer and/or importer 
                        have complied with their own obligations, in other words the distributor must verify the presence of the 
                        name, brand name and the address at which the manufacturer and/or importer can be contacted on 
                        the toy or its packaging and that the batch number, serial number or other elements have been afifxed 
                        on the toy by the manufacturer to allow identiifcation.
                 17     What is the distributor supposed to do if the manufacturer does not afifx his address? 
                        Should the distributor afifx his address?
                        The distributor is not obliged to afifx his address but is obliged to check that the manufacturer’s 
                        address is afifxed. If the distributor notices that a manufacturer has not afifxed his address, he should 
                        inform the manufacturer that he has placed on the market a product that does not conform to the 
                        requirements of the TSD.
                 18     Can distributors ask for the technical documentation?
                        The TSD does not oblige manufacturers to provide the technical documentation to any other operator. 
                        Only Member States’ authorities have the right to request the technical documentation. Upon reasoned 
                        request from an authority, the distributor is obliged to provide this information and therefore must ask 
                        the manufacturer or its authorised representative within the EU, or the importer to provide the technical 
                        documentation to the authorities.
                 19     Is the technical ifle related to a product or to the batch?
                        The technical ifle is related to a product and as a company has internal production control, this should 
                        be part of the technical documentation. For example, if a company tests every batch of paint for lead, 
                        then those test reports could be included in the technical documentation. 
                20 Is it correct that only part of the technical documentation is required when doubts exist 
                        about non-compliance of a toy?
                        If the market surveillance authorities have doubts regarding the conformity of a toy, they may request 
                        the manufacturer’s technical documentation or a translation of relevant parts. The authority should 
                        indicate the nature of the doubt and the parts or aspects of the toy that are subject to investigation. 
                        Only the elements of the technical documentation that are necessary for the investigation should be 
                        requested, so as not to constitute a disproportionate burden for the manufacturer. The request should 
                        indicate the deadline for the receipt of the requested documents, which shall be 30 days. A shorter 
                        deadline can be ifxed if the national authority justiifes the urgency based on an immediate serious risk. 
                        These provisions have a dual purpose: on the one hand, to provide the relevant elements of the 
                        technical documentation enables a manufacturer to explain the measures he has taken to deal with 
                        the risks associated with the toy in order to comply with the TSD requirements. On the other hand, 
                        the examination of these documents helps the market surveillance authorities to complete their 
                        investigation and either dispel or conifrm their doubts about the conformity of the toy concerned.
                                                                                                                                                                              33
                                            21                    Can the importer/distributor translate the technical ifles?
                                                                  According to the TSD, it is the manufacturer who should provide a translation of the relevant parts of 
                                                                  the technical documentation into a Member State’s language following a reasoned request from the 
                                                                  market surveillance authority of that Member State.
                                            22 Who is obliged to have the Declaration of Conformity?
                                                                  When a toy is placed on the market, the manufacturer must draw up a DoC. By doing so, the 
                                                                  manufacturer certiifes and assumes responsibility for the compliance of the toy with the essential 
                                                                  requirements of the TSD. The manufacturer, his authorised representative established within the EU (if 
                                                                  applicable) and the importer must keep the DoC for ten years after the toy is put on the market. The 
                                                                  distributor, upon reasoned request, must be able to provide the DoC to the competent authorities.
                                            23 Is there an obligation to sign the Declaration of Conformity?
                                                                  A manufacturer must sign the DoC as this afifrms that the toy conforms to the TSD, which must be 
                                                                  assured before the toy is placed on the market.
                                            24 Can an importer draw up the Declaration of Conformity?
                                                                  The manufacturer is obliged to draw up the DoC. However, if the manufacturer has, by written 
                                                                  mandate, appointed an authorised representative, the authorised representative may draw up the 
                                                                  DoC. If the importer has been nominated as the manufacturer’s authorised representative, then, under 
                                                                  these circumstances, the importer would be able to draw up the DoC.
                                            25 How fast would an authority expect to have the Declaration of Conformity delivered by a 
                                                                  distributor?
                                                                  The DoC must be made available for the market surveillance authority immediately upon reasoned 
                                                                  request. The technical documentation must be made available to the surveillance authority within 30 
                                                                  days, unless a shorter deadline is justiifed in the case of serious and immediate risk.
                                            26 What is a ‘harmonised standard’?
                                                                  Harmonised standards are European standards, adopted by European standards organisations and 
                                                                  prepared in accordance with the General Guidelines agreed between the European Commission 
                                                                  and the European standards organisations following a mandate issued by the Commission after 
                                                                  consultation with the Member States. References to these standards can be published in the Ofifcial 
                                                                  Journal of the European Union. See:

                                                                  en.htm 
                                            27 If the chemical standards are not available, what should a manufacturer do?
                                                                  The chapter on chemical safety assessment in the                                                                      guidance document on the technical documentation                                                                            
                                                                  explains how to proceed when no standards are available or when such standards do not cover the 
                                                                  chemical hazards in question.
                                                                  34
                 28 How can it be ensured that a toy is only notiifed on RAPEX if it presents a serious risk?
                         RAPEX is the EU alert system for rapidly exchanging information between Member States and the 
                         Commission on measures taken to prevent or restrict the marketing or use of products posing a 
                         serious risk to the health and safety of consumers. It works according to the detailed procedures laid 
                         down in the Annex to the General Product Safety Directive 2001/95 (GPSD). 
                         As soon as a serious and immediate risk is detected, the national authority must consult, insofar as 
                         possible and appropriate, the producer or distributor of the product concerned. The authority should 
                         try to obtain the maximum amount of information on the products and the nature of the danger, 
                         without compromising the need for rapidity. The Member State should inform the Commission when 
                         it adopts, or decides to adopt, emergency measures to prevent, restrict or impose speciifc conditions 
                         on the possible marketing or use of consumer products presenting a serious and immediate risk. 
                         A further condition for invoking RAPEX is that the effects of the risk can go beyond the territory of 
                         the Member State concerned. Member States are not required, as is the case under the safeguard 
                         clause procedure according to the New Approach Directives, to provide evidence to justify the national 
                         measure. The Commission veriifes that the information complies with the provisions of the GPSD and 
                         circulates it to the other Member States.
                 29 Who is responsible for market surveillance?
                         Market surveillance is the responsibility of national authorities. This, in particular, guarantees the 
                         impartiality of market surveillance operations. Each Member State can decide on its own market 
                         surveillance infrastructure. For example, there is no limitation on the allocation of responsibilities 
                         between authorities on a functional or geographical basis as long as surveillance is efifcient and covers 
                         the whole territory.
                 30 What happens to counterfeit toys that are seized?
                         According to Article 8 of the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD), market surveillance authorities 
                         can order, coordinate or organise the recall and destruction of dangerous products. However, the 
                         actions taken by the market surveillance authorities must be proportional to the seriousness of the 
                         risk and take into account the precautionary principle. Regulation 765/2008 only foresees recalls of 
                         products presenting a ‘serious risk’ (Article 20) and enables authorities to destroy such products.
                 31      Where can information about laboratories performing EC-type examination be found?
                         The European Commission’s website lists all notiifed bodies for the Toy Safety Directive.
                         Do the warning labels have to be in the language of the country?
                 32 Manufacturers should ensure that the toy is accompanied by warnings, instructions and safety 
                         information in a language or languages easily understood by consumers, as determined by the 
                         Member State concerned (national law indicates the language required for each Member State).
                 33 What steps have been taken to harmonise EU and US requirements?
                         New toy safety legislation has recently been introduced in both the EU and US. These two new pieces 
                         of legislation necessitated an update of the respective standards. EU standards are predominantly 
                         based on the TSD while the US standards have to be approved by the Consumer Product Safety 
                         Commission (CPSC). However, the European Commission and the CPSC as well as the respective 
                         standardisation bodies are discussing cooperation.
                                                                  35
