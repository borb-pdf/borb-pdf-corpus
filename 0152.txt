         Coherence
       It should be clear how each 
      sentence and paragraph relates to 
          the big picture
    One paragraph, one point
    • A paragraph should have one main point, 
      expressed in a single point sentence 
    • Typically the point sentence should appear 
      at or near the beginning of the paragraph
      No point sentence

  An abstract for this talk
          Context
   Learning to write well is an essential part of becoming a 
   successful researcher.  Unfortunately, many researchers 
   ifnd it very hard to write well because they do not know 
   how to view their text from the perspective of the reader.  
   In this talk, we present a simple set of principles for good 
   writing, based on an understanding of how readers 
   process information.  Unlike such platitudes as "Be clear" 
   or "Omit needless words", our principles are constructive: 
   one can easily check whether a piece of text satisifes 
   them, and if it does not, the principles suggest concrete 
   ways to improve it.

         Introduction
   • Like an expanded version of the abstract 
   • Alternative approach (SPJ): Eliminate Context 
    - Start with a concrete example, e.g. 
      “Consider this Haskell code…” 
    - If this works, it can be eﬀective, 
      but I ifnd it otfen doesn’t work 
    - It assumes reader already knows context
  A structure that works
  • Abstract (1-2 paragraphs, 1000 readers) 
  • Intro (1-2 pages, 100 readers) 
  • Main ideas (2-3 pages, 50 readers) 
  • Technical meat (4-6 pages, 5 readers) 
  • Related work (1-2 pages, 100 readers)
     “Main ideas” section
    • Use concrete illustrative examples and 
      high-level intuition 
    • Do not have to show the general solution 
      (that’s what the technical section is for)
    Why have a “main ideas” 
         section at all?
          1. Forces you to have a “takeaway” 
          2. Many readers only care about the 
            takeaway, not the technical details 
          3. For those who want the technical 
            details, the main ideas are still 
            useful as “scaﬀolding”

  • Related work (1-2 pages, 100 readers)
        Related work
   1. It goes at the end of the paper. 
     • You can only properly compare to related 
      work once you’ve explained your own. 
   2. Give real comparisons, not a “laundry list”! 
     • Explain in detail how your work iflls the 
      Gap in a way that related work doesn’t.

   • Name your baby 
   • Just in time 
   • CGI model for abstract/intro 
   • Have a “main ideas” section
