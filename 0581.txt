              The Construction Industry Council (CIC) is committed to seeking continuous improvement 
              in all aspects of the construction industry in Hong Kong. To achieve this aim, the CIC 
              forms Committees, Task Forces and other forums to review speciifc areas of work with the 
              intention of producing Alerts, Reference Materials, Guidelines and Codes of Conduct to 
              assist participants in the industry to strive for excellence. 
              The CIC appreciateented immediately s that some improvements and practices can be implem
              whilst others may take more time to adjust. It is for this reason that four separate categories 
              of publication have been adopted, the purposes of which are as follows:
              Alerts                 Reminders  in  the  form  of  brief  lealfets  produced  quickly  to  draw 
                                    the immediate attention of relevant stakeholders the need to follow 
                                    some good practices or to implement some preventative measures in 
                                    relation to the construction industry.
              Reference Materials   Reference Materials for adopting standards or methodologies in such 
                                    ways that are generally regarded by the industry as good practices. 
                                    The CIC recommends the adoption of these Reference Materials by 
                                    industry stakeholders where appropriate.
              Guidelines             The CIC expects all industry participants to adopt the recommendations
                                    set out in such Guidelines and to adhere to such standards or procedures
                                    therein at all times. Industry participants are expected to be able to justify
                                    any course of action that deviates from those recommendations.
              Codes of Conduct       Under the Construction Industry Council Ordinance (Cap 587), the 
                                    CIC is tasked to formulate codes of conduct and enforce such codes. 
                                    The Codes of Conduct issued by the CIC set out the principles that 
                                    all relevant industry participants should follow. The CIC may take 
                                    necessary actions to ensure the compliance with the Codes.
              If you have attempted to follow this publication, we do encourage you to share your feedback 
              with us. Please take a moment to ifll out the Feedback Form attached to this publication in 
              order that we can further enhance it for the beneift of all concerned. With our joint efforts, we 
              believe our construction industry will develop further and will continue to prosper for years 
              to come.

              1. Introduction
              1.1   Unsafe work-above-ground (i.e. any work not carried out on or from the ground 
                    or from part of a permanent structure) has been one of the major causes of fall 
                    from height accidents, resulting in serious injuries or even fatalities.  Most of these 
                    accidents, however, could have been prevented if suitable working platforms had 
                    been provided and properly used.  In some serious and fatality cases, control, if 
                    any, on use of ladders had been very slack, and conduct of risk assessments and 
                    formulation of method statements with due consideration of task-speciifc factors such 
                    as job locations and work nature, etc. had not been done.
              1.2    For any work-above-ground, suitable working platforms should be the primary means 
                    of support to be considered for use.  For work-above-ground below 2m where working 
                    platforms could not be erected under special working conditions (e.g. restrictive 
                    workplace), suitable light-duty working platforms should be used.  Unless in very 
                    exceptional circumstances that working platforms or light-duty working platforms are 
                    impracticable to be used, use of ladders for work-above-ground should be prohibited.  
                    Under such exceptional circumstances where ladders have to be used, task-speciifc 
                    risk assessment should be conducted and safe system of work, such as a permit-to-
                    work system, should be formulated and implemented beforehand.  Ladders should 
                    not be used for any work-above-ground at 2m or more.
              1.3   This publication makes reference to the core elements of a safe system of work and 
                    safety management system, and recommends necessary precautionary measures 
                    to enhance safety on work-above-ground, including task-speciifc risk assessments, 
                    appropriate method statements, use of suitable working platforms or other safe 
                    means of support and stringent control on use of ladders.

               2. Limitations
               2.1    It is important to note that compliance with this publication does not itself confer 
                      immunity from legal obligations in Hong Kong.  Employers and contractors are 
                      reminded to observe and comply with statutory provisions, relevant codes of practice 
                      and other government departments’ requirements so as to discharge their legal and 
                      other pertinent duties related to work-above-ground.
               3. Risk Assessment
               3.1    As regards work-above-ground, employers and contractors should conduct task-speciifc 
                      risk assessments and thereby formulate safe work methods and implement safety 
                      precautions and procedures as appropriate to prevent and eliminate work-related 
                      hazards before commencing work. In the ifrst place, work-above-ground should be 
                      avoided as far as possible, for instance, by designing and using speciifc hand tools to 
                      allow the work to be done on the ground (e.g. using a long reach pole).  
               3.2    If there is genuine need to work above ground, employers and contractors should 
                      consider all relevant factors including the work nature, appliances and materials to be 
                      used, working height and working environment, etc. in formulating and implementing 
                      effective safety measures.
                                                              6
               4. Safe Use of Working Platforms
               4.1   Whenever work-above-ground could not be avoided after conducting risk 
                      assessments, suitable working platforms (e.g. mobile working platforms) should be 
                      provided and used irrespective of the working height.
                
               4.2    Working platforms should be suitably designed and constructed.  All components of 
                      the working platforms should be made of suitable and sound materials of sufifcient 
                      strength and capacity for the purpose for which they are used, and free from patent 
                      defect.
                
               4.3    Working platforms should be erected on ifrm, even and level ground.  The surrounding 
                      of working platforms should be kept free from waste and miscellaneous materials.
                
               4.4    Erection and use of working platforms on ramps, stairs, unstable or uneven lfoor 
                      surface without suitable authentic accessories from the manufacturer to enhance the 
                      stability of the working platforms or in locations where the working platforms may be 
                      hit or struck by moving objects should be prohibited.  
                
               4.5    The surrounding of the working platforms should be free from exposed live metal 
                      parts or potentially exposed live conductors to prevent electrical hazard.
                
               4.6    Working platforms should be provided with suitable access and egress (e.g. straight 
                      or inclined ladders with suitable hand grips).  When ascending/ descending the 
                      working platforms, the workers should maintain 3 points of contact with the platforms 
                      (i.e. both hands gripping with one leg stepping at the same time or both legs stepping 
                      with one single hand gripping).  Workers should keep the centre of gravity of their 
                      bodies within the working platforms and should not overload them. Workers should 
                      beware of overhead room and check for any obstruction to prevent accidental hit on 
                      the head before and during the use of working platforms.  Every worker should wear 
                      a safety helmet with a chin strap.

                                                                         Ascending/descending the mobile 
                                                                         working platform from the inside of a 
                                                                         mobile working platform.
                                                                         Workers should beware of overhead 
                                                                         room and check for any obstruction 
                                                                         to prevent accidental hit on the head 
                                                                         before and during the use of working 
                                                                         platforms. Safety helmets with chin 
                                                                         straps should be used.
               4.7     The safe height-to-base ratio and other safety recommendations in the instruction 
                       manual should be strictly followed - never deliberately increase the height of mobile 
                       working platforms beyond that recommended by the manufacturer.  If required, the 
                       outriggers of the platform should be fully extended as per manufacturer’s requirement 
                       to ensure its secure foundation and stability.
                
               4.8     During use, the workers should not overstretch the bodies outside the working 
                       platforms. Take note of the safe loading capacity as stated by the manufacturer 
                       and never place excessive materials on the working platforms to avoid overloading 
                       and damaging the working platforms.  All guard-rails and toe-boards provided on 
                       the working platforms should be kept erected, except for the time and to the extent 
                       necessary for the access of persons or the movement of materials but should be 
                       replaced or erected as soon as practicable afterwards.  Stepping on the toe-boards 
                       or guard-rails of working platforms (either intermediate guard-rails or top guard-rails) 
                       is strictly prohibited.
                                                                8
                                                                          Do not overstretch the body outside 
                                                                          the working platform.
                                                                          Do not lean on the guard-rail of the 
                                                                          working platform.
               4.9     Be aware of weather conditions if the working platforms are to be used outdoors. 
                       Never cover the working platforms with canvas to prevent overturning due to windy 
                       weather.  Where reasonably practicable, working platforms should be braced or 
                       tied into a permanent structure to enhance their stability.  In case of typhoon and 
                       inclement weather, stop using the working platforms immediately and properly secure 
                       the platforms to prevent toppling in wind or dismantle it and keep it in a safe place.
                
               4.10   All the castors of a mobile working platform should be if rmly locked in position while 
                       ascending/descending and using the platform.
                                                                9
               4.11    When a mobile working platform is being moved to another work location, do not allow 
                       any persons to stay or any object that may increase risk of toppling of the platform or 
                       loose objects (e.g. hand tools) that may fall during movement of platform to be placed 
                       thereon. Also, moving the platform on rough and uneven surfaces should be avoided 
                       as it may make the platform collapse or overturn.
                
               4.12   Stop using the working platforms immediately when they are found damaged and 
                       label them with suitable signs and warning notices.
                
               4.13   After use, the working platforms should be properly stored and maintained.
                                                                    Ensure that all the castors are if rmly locked 
                                                                    in position while ascending/ descending 
                                                                    and using a mobile working platform.
                                                                    When moving the mobile working platform,  
                                                                    no person should be allowed to stand and 
                                                                    no object should be placed on the mobile 
                                                                    working platform.
                                                              10
               5. Safe Use of Light-duty Working Platforms
               5.1    For work-above-ground below 2m where working platforms could not be erected 
                      under special working conditions (e.g. restrictive work space) and the work concerned 
                      is of simple nature, use of suitable light-duty working platforms such as step platforms 
                      or hop-up platforms should be considered.  When light-duty working platforms are 
                      used, the following speciifc safety measures should be followed.
                                                                  Step platform deployed for checking the 
                                                                  ventilation system in a room where there is 
                                                                  restricted space to accommodate a typical 
                                                                  working platform.
               5.2    It should be borne in mind that only one person is permitted to work on each light-duty 
                      working platform at one time. 
                
               5.3    Workers using light-duty working platforms should have received relevant safety 
                      training provided by the supplier, including erection and dismantling of the working 
                      platforms, or other equivalent training such that they clearly understand the safety 
                      instruction or manual of the manufacturer.
                
               5.4    Before use, inspection (including visual check) of the light-duty working platform 
                      should be conducted according to the safety checklist provided by the supplier or 
                      other equivalent safety checklist to ensure that the working platforms are in good 
                      condition and free from damage.  Besides, the stabilisers or outriggers of the light-
                      duty working platforms should be fully extended and locked in position in accordance 
                      with the manufacturer’s manual to ensure their stability before stepping on the 
                      platforms.
                
                                                             11
                                                          Before use, inspection (including visual 
                                                          check) of the light-duty working platforms 
                                                          according to the safety checklist provided 
                                                          by the supplier or other equivalent safety 
                                                          checklist should be conducted.
             5.5   The workers should face the light-duty working platforms when ascending or 
                   descending the working platforms.  Do not apply excessive force to the working 
                   platforms and induce lateral force rendering the overturning of the working platforms.
              
                                                          Worker should face the light-duty working 
                                                          platform when ascending or descending.
                                                          Do not apply excessive force to the working
                                                          platform and induce lateral force rendering
                                                          the overturning of the working platform.
                                                    12
                 6. Stringent Control on Use of Ladders
                 6.1     Ladders should normally be restricted for access/egress purpose only.  Unless in very 
                         exceptional circumstances following a task-speciifc risk assessment, ladders should 
                         not be used for work-above-ground and in no cases should ladders be used for work 
                         at height of 2m or more.  In particular, ladders should not be used for electrical work 
                         as far as practicable because even a mild electrical shock will likely cause loss of 
                         balance of the workers, resulting in fall from height.
                 6.2     If the use of ladders is unavoidable, it should be put under stringent control, such as 
                         through implementing a permit-to-work system, to ensure that adequate and suitable 
                         control and safety measures are put in place to safeguard the workers concerned.  
                         The permit-to-work for use of ladders should be issued by a competent person who is 
                         appointed by the proprietor/employer/contractor and by reason of substantial training 
                         and practical experience in relation to conducting risk assessment and issuance of 
                         permit-to-work, competent to conduct the duties, with a task-speciifc risk assessment 
                         conducted and all necessary safety measures related to use of ladders taken.  While 
                         the implementation of a permit-to-work system is impracticable, pre-work check 
                         on use of ladder with the use of a checklist should be conducted. If ladders are 
                         unavoidably to be used for electrical work, the permit-to-work system or pre-work 
                         check should also cover other risk mitigation measures (e.g. the ladders to be used 
                         are made of non-conductive material) as appropriate.
                 6.3     The following are some guidance and key elements for a permit-to-work (in this case, 
                         a permit to work on use of ladder) system:
                         In preparation stage:
                         •       the persons who may permit the work should be clearly designated and made 
                                 known to the workers concerned;
                         •       suitable training and instruction in the issue, use and closure of the permit 
                                 should be provided to the relevant personnel;
                         •       the work to be done, work location, start time and duration of the permit should 
                                 be clearly descripted and stated on the permit;
                         •       task-speciifc  risk  assessment  to  identify  potential  hazards  at  the  job  site 
                                 should be conducted;
                         •       the work location and the equipment to be used should be inspected; and
                         •       the safety precautions required to minimise risks associated with carrying out 
                                 the intended work should be carefully considered and properly documented.
                                                                    13
                           During work stage:
                           •        no work should be allowed without the issuance of the permit or upon the 
                                    expiry of the permit; 
                           •        the permit to work as well as the required precautions should be properly 
                                    implemented, monitored and controlled; 
                           •        handing over of responsibilities between shifts, if applicable, should be 
                                    properly done and clearly descripted on the permit; and
                           •        the permit should be properly displayed during the time at which the work-
                                    above-ground concerned is taking place.
                           Post work stage:
                           •        suitable steps should be carried out for reinstating the site to its original state 
                                    when the required task is completed to ensure that any residual risks are 
                                    removed before the site is handed over; and
                           •        the permit to work should be properly kept for a reasonable period of time for 
                                    record and future reference purposes.
                  6.4      The permit to use a ladder for working above ground less than 2 metres should only 
                           be considered in case of restrictive workplace that makes the erection of any working 
                           platform not practicable.  Annex A lists out the conditions that should be imposed in 
                           such a situation.
                  6.5      Samples of permit to work and checklist for the assessment on use of ladders are 
                           shown in Annexes B and C respectively.
                  7. Use of Personal Protective Equipment
                  7.1      The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent workers from falling from 
                           height should always be treated as the last resort.  If this type of protective measures 
                           is needed on warranted occasions following a task-speciifc risk assessment, steps 
                           should be taken to ensure that suitable PPE coupled with appropriate anchorage 
                           system is provided, used and maintained, and the workers concerned use them 
                           properly.
                                                                           14
               8. Coordination and Communication
               8.1    An effective coordination and communication system should be established and 
                      maintained among the employer/contractor, different levels of management/ 
                      supervisory personnel and workers to ensure clear understanding of the potential 
                      hazards, the associated hazard control program and the delineation of safety 
                      responsibilities.
               8.2    The main contractors and subcontractors should clearly delineate their roles and 
                      responsibilities in the provision and use of working platforms, and the restrictions on 
                      the use of ladders, such as through agreements or contracts.
               9. Monitoring and Control
               9.1    An effective monitoring and control system should be developed, implemented and 
                      maintained to ensure that the safe working procedures and safety measures for 
                      work-above-ground.
               9.2    If any unsafe working conditions are found, the employer/contractors should suspend 
                      the work involved immediately.  The work under suspension can only be resumed 
                      after all necessary improvement measures have been implemented effectively. 
               10. Safety Information, Instruction and Training
               10.1   Workers and site supervisory staff should be provided with necessary safety 
                      information, instruction and training to ensure that they are all familiar with the 
                      potential hazard of fall-from-height, safe work method and safety measures for the 
                      work-above-ground.

                                                                                                                                  Annex A
                   Conditions should be imposed when ladders are to be used
                   i)        The design and build of the ladder should be suitable for the work.  It should be 
                             provided with sufifcient foothold and handhold along the climb and in the working 
                             position of the ladder;
                   ii)       The ladder should be of adequate strength and free from defect;
                   iii)      The ladder should be placed on a ifrm, even and level ground.  It should be adequately 
                             secured and stabilized;
                   iv)       The use of ladder for strenuous or heavy work should be prohibited;
                   v)        The standing height and the time duration of the work on the ladder should be 
                             restricted;
                   vi)       Safe work procedures should be followed and suitable equipment/tool should be 
                             used; 
                   vii)      Sufifcient information, instruction and training in respect of working on ladders should 
                             be provided to all levels of site personnel, including the workers and the supervisors, 
                             so as to effectively communicate to them the hazards associated with the use of 
                             ladders and the conditions to be fuliflled under the permit-to-use system; and
                   viii)     An effective monitoring and control system should be established and put in place to 
                             ensure full implementation of the permit-to-use system.
                                                                                16
