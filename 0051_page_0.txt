                 Invoicing Tolerances 
                    Coupa runs invoice tolerances to determine whether invoices should be put on hold and checked for approvals. This makes them a key step when you're 
                    setting up invoice approvals.  
                    You can set up invoice tolerances from Setup > Financial Setup > Invoice Tolerances. While working with these tolerances, note that they're set up for 
                    each Chart of Accounts (COA), so be sure you're working with the right COA when you're setting up, checking, and editing tolerance settings. 
                    Coupa measures some tolerances against PO-backed lines. These tolerances apply to PO-backed invoices only. Coupa measures tolerances using 
                    currency values and percentages. Each tolerance is clearly labeled in the tolerance table. 
                    Coupa breaks tolerances up into two different groups: 
                         •    Internally created invoices 
                         •    Supplier created invoices (tolerances for invoices created through the Coupa Supplier Network) 
                    Under these groups, Coupa lets you configure these tolerances: 
                         •    Invoice quantity compared to PO quantity (%) 
                         •    Invoice unit price compared to PO unit price (compared to specified default currency amount) 
                         •    Invoice unit price compared to PO unit price (%) 
                         •    Invoice amount compared to PO amount (%) 
                         •    Invoice amount compared to PO amount (compared to specified default currency amount) 
                         •    Non-backed line great than (compared to specified default currency amount): This is the only tolerance that is for internally crate ed invoices only. 
                         •    Contract backed line greater than (USD)
