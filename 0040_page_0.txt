                This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from
                images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of
                an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and
                are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of afﬁne dis-
                tortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination.
                The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be cor-
                rectly matched with high probability against a large database of features from
                many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features
                for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual fea-
                tures to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor
                algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a sin-
                gle object, and ﬁnally performing veriﬁcation through least-squares solution for
                consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify
                objects amongclutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.
