          1.  Executive summary 
          This document is prepared for consideration by National Competent Authorities and Applicants with the 
          purpose of proposing a template providing instructions to the user on the best practice for preparing a 
          herbal tea (by infusion, decoction, maceration), using standard terminology.  
          This template describes the preparation of herbal teas depending on the prescribed method.  
          2.  Introduction 
          For herbal substances/preparations that are administered as herbal tea, instructions on the method of 
          preparation may be crucial, because different preparations may exert different actions and in some 
          circumstances may have a different safety profile.  
          Since the wide variability in the concentration of the constituents of a herbal tea can be due to intrinsic 
          characteristics (i.e. growing, harvesting, drying and preservation conditions of the plant material) and 
          to the tea preparation procedure, in order to limit fluctuation from the extraction procedures, detailed 
          instructions to users should be provided (e.g. solvent when different from drinking water, temperature 
          and time of the operations).  
          Combination methods are necessary if a tea mixture includes ingredients that need different methods 
          of preparation. For example, in a tea mixture some ingredients might need to undergo maceration and 
          others need to be infused or decocted. Aromatic herbs like mint may be infused at the end of a 
          decoction. 
          Moreover, for particular traditions or for specified herbal substances/preparations, specific methods of 
          preparation of the herbal tea need to be applied. A harmonised approach at European level on the 
          terms used for the preparation of herbal teas in European Union herbal monographs and related 
          documents is given in the Glossary of herbal teas (EMA/HMPC/5829/2010 Rev.1). 
          3.  Scope 
          This paper applies to herbal medicinal products (HMPs)/traditional herbal medicinal products (THMPs) 
          intended to be administered in the form of herbal teas.  
          Instant herbal teas as defined by the European Pharmacopoeia monograph are not covered by this 
          paper, because the preparation of the instant herbal tea in this case consists solely of reconstitution 
          with water.  
          This template should be considered in conjunction with the relevant legislation on European Union 
          herbal monographs and European Union list, the ‘Guideline on declaration of herbal substances and 
          herbal preparations in herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal medicinal products’, the ‘Glossary 
          on herbal teas’, the ‘Concept paper on the development of a guideline on preparation on herbal teas’, 
          the ‘Addendum to the Quality Review of Documents templates for SmPC, Labelling and Patient Leaflet 
          on Mutual-recognition and Decentralised procedures specific for (Traditional) Herbal Medicinal Products 
          ((T)HMPs)’, and the ‘Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics’ as published on the Website of 
          the European Commission in the Notice to Applicants, Volume 2C.

                           4.  Definitions 
                           Decoctions1 (decocta) are liquid preparations extemporaneously prepared by pouring cold water on 
                           the herbal substance(s), reduced to a suitable size, heating to the boil and allowing to simmer for a 
                           defined period of time depending upon the type and size of the plant material, usually for 15 to 30 
                           minutes when not otherwise specified. The corresponding operation is referred to as ‘decoction’. 
                           Decoction is generally not applicable to herbal substances containing volatile active constituents.  
                           Drug extract ratio (DER) means the ratio between the quantity of herbal substance used in the 
                           manufacture of a herbal preparation and the quantity of the herbal preparation obtained. The number 
                           (given as the actual range) written before the colon is the relative quantity of the herbal substance; 
                           the number written after the colon is the relative quantity of the herbal preparation obtained. 
                           Herbal medicinal products are any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active substances 
                           one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal 
                           substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations. 
                           Herbal preparations are obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, 
                           distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include 
                           comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and 
                           processed exudates. 
                           Herbal substances all, mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an 
                           unprocessed, usually dried form but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected 
                           to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely 
                           defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, 
                           species, variety and author). 
                           Herbal teas (plantae ad ptisanam) consist of one or more herbal substances intended for oral 
                                                                                                                                                                                  2
                           aqueous preparations prepared by means of decoction, infusion or maceration . The preparation is 
                           prepared immediately before use. Herbal teas are usually supplied in bulk form or in sachets (Ph. 
                           Eur.). The herbal substance(s) used for the herbal teas may be processed in advance (e.g. 
                           comminuted, crushed, etc.). The term ‘herbal teas’ is also used to designate the oral aqueous 
                           preparations (tisanes or ptisanae) obtained by means of decoction, infusion or maceration. Usually, 
                           infusion is appropriate for leaves, flowers and delicate parts whereas decoction or maceration is 
                           appropriate for roots, rhizomes and barks.  
                           Herbal tea mixtures (species ad ptisanam) are mixtures of herbal substances prepared in 
                           appropriate dimensions to facilitate mixing and to reduce the potential separation and settling of the 
                           different ingredients. 
                           Infusions (infusa) are liquid preparations extemporaneously prepared by pouring boiling water on the 
                           herbal substance(s), whole or reduced to a suitable size and allowing to steep for a defined period of 
                           time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, when not otherwise specified. The corresponding operation is referred to 
                           as ‘infusion’. 
                           The use of boiling water is important for lowering the microbial bioburden of the herbal substances. 
                           This is recognised by the European Pharmacopoeia in determining the different recommendations on 
                           microbiological quality for medicinal products containing herbal substances and/or herbal preparations.

              Macerates (macerata) are liquid preparations extemporaneously prepared by soaking the herbal 
              substance(s), reduced to a suitable size, in water at room temperature for a defined period of time, 
              usually for 30 minutes, when not otherwise specified. The corresponding operation is referred to as 
              ‘maceration’. When the maceration is performed with gentle heating at a temperature higher than 
              room temperature, but not to boiling, the process is termed ‘digestion’.  
              Traditional herbal medicinal products: Herbal Medicinal Products for human use that fulfil the 
              conditions laid down in Article 16a (1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
              5.  Legal basis and considerations  
              Directive 2001/83/EC introduces the legal framework for the provision of European Union herbal 
              monographs covering the therapeutic uses and safe conditions of well-established and/or traditional 
              use for herbal substances and preparations.  
              This document aims to provide guidance on how to provide further explanation on the preparations of 
              herbal teas according to the prescribed method in the patient leaflet.  
              The same approach is also recommended to be considered for HMPs/THMPs authorised or registered 
              according to a national procedure. 
              It is suggested that the patient leaflet of HMPs/THMPs for human use intended to be administered in 
              form of herbal tea or for infusion/decoction/macerate preparation includes under the section 3. ‘How to 
              take use X’ a subsection ‘Instructions for preparation’. This subsection is also recommended to be 
              described in the SmPC under section 6.6. Special precautions for disposal and other handling or under 
              section 4.2 Posology and method of administration. 
              6.  Template 
              The ‘Instructions for preparation’ subsection is recommended to be structured as follows.  
              Standard statements are given in the template, which is recommended to be used whenever they are 
              applicable.  
              If the applicant needs to deviate from these statements to accommodate medicinal product-specific 
              requirements, alternative or additional statements will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the 
              National Competent Authority.

              explain any deviation from the usual procedure or in particular circumstances, that should be specified 
              case by case: e.g. qualitative and quantitative composition of solvents when different from drinking 
              water, any substances (e.g. small amount of acid or alkaline substances) to be added to improve the 
              dissolution of selected herbal constituents, the need to previously moisten with cold water tough plant 
              material (e.g. barks, woods, seeds, dry fruits, roots, and rhizomes), preservation conditions, 
              precaution in the administration. It is up to the applicant to convert the grams in other suitable 
              measure more friendly for the patients (e.g. measuring spoon)].
