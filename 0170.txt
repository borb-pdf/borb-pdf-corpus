                 Summary 
                 1.      Mostly without realising it, everyone in the UK benefits if the market for audit 
                         services works well; but we suffer if it does not. The information companies 
                         provide about themselves is used by investors to make decisions that affect 
                         people in many ways: through pension schemes, both those open to all and 
                         those for company employees; through other investments or savings; as 
                         customers or suppliers; or simply as participants in an economy which relies 
                         on trust and confidence to run smoothly.  
                 2.      Independent audits should ensure that company information can be trusted; 
                         they provide a service which is essential to shareholders and also serves the 
                         wider public interest. But recent events have brought back to the surface 
                         longstanding concerns that audits all too often fall short. And in a market 
                         where trust and confidence are crucial, even the perception that information 
                         cannot be trusted is a problem.  
                 3.      The fact that companies select and pay their own auditors is an impediment to 
                         high-quality audits. Shareholders and the public cannot see what goes on 
                         inside a company, so they need auditors to check; but it may be in company 
                         managers’ interests not to be fully transparent. Mandating that audit 
                         committees make the selection has only been a partial solution, as we have 
                         seen from the prevalence of ‘chemistry’ and ‘cultural fit’ in tender criteria.  
                 4.      Choice of auditor is extremely limited for the biggest companies: sometimes to 
                         as few as one or two firms. Past remedies have improved some aspects of 
                         the market, but have not broken down the barriers to challenger firms 
                         stepping up. Such a big gap between the Big Four and the rest is not healthy, 
                         and will persist unless it is tackled. And choice could get worse rather than 
                         better if left unaddressed; choice would be severely further curtailed if one of 
                         the Big Four were to cease to operate.  
                 5.      A well-functioning market would produce high-quality audits. Competition and 
                         regulation should work together so that audit firms and individuals all have the 
                         strongest possible incentives to deliver quality. Part of this is about the 
                         regulator setting standards and enforcing against them; that has been the 
                         focus of the independent review into the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), 
                         led by Sir John Kingman (whose report has also been published today, and 
                         with whom we have liaised throughout). But competition, enabled by 
                         regulation, should ensure that firms and individuals succeed financially and 
                         reputationally if they produce the highest quality over and above the minimum 
                         standards. In order to create the strongest possible incentives for highly 
                         competent, professionally sceptical audits, competition must be focused on 
                                                                   6 
                                                                                                                        
                         quality, and there must be sufficient choice of viable competitors over the long 
                         term.  
                 6.      Based on our analysis to date, we propose the following remedies to create 
                         incentives for better audit quality, in tandem with improved regulation as 
                         recommended in the separate review of the FRC. 
                             a.  Regulatory scrutiny of auditor appointment and management. 
                                 Auditor appointments need to be made with a focus on ensuring that 
                                 companies' numbers are tested as effectively as possible. This could 
                                 be fully achieved if appointments were taken away from audited 
                                 companies, particularly in the absence of widespread investor focus on 
                                 audit. But our current understanding is that it would not be possible to 
                                 do this on a generic basis for all large companies, at least not now, as 
                                 the European legal framework appears to preclude it. The practical 
                                 complexities of appointing auditors for the biggest companies also 
                                 present challenges, although we expect these would be surmountable.  
                                  
                                 As an alternative, we propose close scrutiny of audit appointment and 
                                 management by the regulator, to secure audit committees’ 
                                 accountability and independence from companies. This must ensure a 
                                 clear priority on quality and challenge from auditors, as well as 
                                 minimising any bias against firms from outside the Big Four.  
                             b.  Breaking down barriers to challenger firms – mandatory joint 
                                 audit. The market structure needs to change to ensure that there are 
                                 enough realistic alternative audit providers so that every incumbent 
                                 auditor feels another firm breathing down its neck, ready to serve 
                                 shareholders’ and the public's interests better. Achieving this after 15-
                                 plus years of an entrenched Big Four will not be easy; but no direct 
                                 attempt has yet been made to do this.  
                                  
                                 We propose that FTSE350 audits should be carried out jointly by two 
                                 firms, at least one of which should be from outside the Big Four. This 
                                 will give challenger firms access to the largest clients, while allowing for 
                                 a cross-check on quality, as each auditor reviews the other’s work.  
                                  
                                 A possible alternative if concerns arise over joint audit’s effectiveness 
                                 is a market share cap – ensuring that a subset of major audit contracts 
                                 are only available to non-Big Four firms – which would also support 
                                 long-term choice.  
                                  
                                 We also propose a resilience remedy to protect against the Big Four 
                                 becoming a Big Three.  
                                                                   7 
                                                                                                                        
                             c.  A split between audit and advisory businesses. To produce the 
                                 best quality, auditors’ exclusive focus should be on providing audits; 
                                 and their wider business interests should not in any way compromise 
                                 this. Rules are already in place at the level of individual contracts to 
                                 prevent auditors from cross-selling other services to their clients; but 
                                 changes at the firm level are also necessary to ensure a single-minded 
                                 focus on audit quality.  
                                  
                                 This could imply a full structural split of advisory and other non-audit 
                                 services away from audit, which would also ensure maximum choice 
                                 among the Big Four. However, the international networks these firms 
                                 belong to, and the extent to which audits draw on advisory expertise, 
                                 present some difficulties. A more immediately feasible alternative 
                                 would be for firms’ audit and non-audit businesses to be split into 
                                 clearly defined separate operating entities, with separate management, 
                                 accounts and remuneration, but to remain under the same 
                                 organisational umbrella. That way auditors would only be rewarded for 
                                 providing good audits, but would still be able to draw on expertise from 
                                 their sister firms.  
                             d.  Peer review of audits, commissioned by and reporting to the regulator, 
                                 could offer an additional way of enforcing standards, both keeping 
                                 auditors on their toes and making quality levels more visible.  
                 7.      Concerns about this market are longstanding, and while some have been at 
                         least partly answered through previous interventions, serious problems 
                         persist. The package of remedies we propose in this paper should, in tandem 
                         with more effective regulation, bring about significant improvements. But if 
                         elements of the package prove not to produce the necessary effects – either 
                         following consultation, or in detailed design and implementation, or once they 
                         have been in place for a period – some of the more drastic but harder to 
                         implement remedies, like independent appointment and structurally splitting 
                         audit and non-audit services, will need to be revisited.  
                 8.      Many responses to our invitation to comment document highlighted the 
                         ‘expectations gap’ as a large part of the problem – the concern that people’s 
                         expectation of what audits should do is far removed from what is currently 
                         required in the legal and regulatory framework. There is something in this: 
                         expecting auditors to prevent all company failures would be unreasonable, 
                         and even among experts there is disagreement on precisely what an audit is 
                         supposed to achieve. Clarifying this and considering how audits might best 
                         serve shareholders and ultimately the public interest is necessary, which is 
                         why we welcome the expected review on the purpose and scope of audit, 
                         announced by the government today. But the fact remains that even against 
                                                                   8 
                                                                                                                        
                         the more modest benchmark in the current standards, audits are too often 
                         falling short; pointing to the ‘expectations gap’ is no excuse for this failure.  
                 9.      We welcome views from interested parties on the proposed remedies as set 
                         out in this document by 21 January, before we make a final decision on any 
                         potential recommendations to the Government.  
                                                                   9 
                                                                                                            
               1.     Introduction 
               1.1    In this section we explain why we are looking at the market for the supply of 
                      statutory audit services in the UK. We explain: 
                      (a)  Why audit is important;  
                      (b)  Some basic facts about the UK audit sector; 
                      (c)  The concerns that have arisen around audits; and  
                      (d)  How we have examined these concerns so far. 
               Why audit is important 
               1.2    Most people will never read an auditor’s opinion on a company’s accounts. 
                      But often without realising it, tens of millions of people depend, directly or 
                      indirectly, in some way on independent audits to help ensure that companies 
                      report truthfully on their performance. Unreliable accounts can lead to the 
                      wrong investment decisions and undermine shareholder scrutiny of 
                      management, which in turn risks people’s jobs, their pensions and/or their 
                      savings. The availability of trustworthy financial information on the 
                      performance of companies is vital to providing the confidence that is 
                      necessary for the proper functioning of a market economy. 
               The UK audit sector  
               1.3    All companies in the UK are required, under the Companies Act, to have their 
                                                                              1
                      annual accounts audited externally, unless exempt.  There are many audit 
                      firms in the UK that can carry out these statutory audits, but few such auditors 
                      currently audit the largest publicly listed companies, including those listed on 
                                      2
                      the FTSE 350.  
               1.4    The large auditors in the UK are part of similarly branded international 
                      networks of audit firms. Audit firms in these networks are experienced at 
                      working together to provide international companies with a seamless audit 
                
                
               1
                 A company’s auditor must make a report to the company’s members on the accounts produced, and for public 
               companies these reports are laid before the company in a general meeting. For Public Interest Entities (PIEs), 
               audit committees typically have a key role in the selection, appointment and removal of auditors, as well as 
               agreeing the terms and fees to be paid, and making recommendations to the company board concerning these 
               matters. 
               2
                 The FTSE 100 and 250 collectively are referred to as the FTSE 350. 
                
                                                            10 
                                                                                                              
                       service across borders, so a company may only need to appoint one single 
                       auditor for its global business.  
               1.5     In the UK, 97% of audits of FTSE 350 companies are undertaken by the Big 
                       Four auditors, which are PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), KPMG, Ernst & 
                                                  3
                       Young (EY) and Deloitte.  While there are many smaller audit firms that carry 
                       out audits for unlisted and smaller companies, there are several challenger 
                       firms, some of which have a small number of clients in the FTSE 350. 
                       Challenger firms include Grant Thornton, Mazars, BDO, RSM, and Moore 
                       Stephens. Many challenger firms have international networks of firms like the 
                       Big Four, although these are more limited. 
               1.6     There has been consolidation in the audit sector in the last 30 years. Before 
                       1987, there were eight large international audit firms in the UK, and there 
                       have been four large audit firms since 2002, following Arthur Andersen’s 
                       demise that year and the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & 
                       Lybrand in 1998. 
               Concerns about the audit market are both widespread and 
               longstanding 
                                                        th
               1.7     The earliest auditors, in the 19  century, were heralded as protecting 
                       investors against unscrupulous company managers, particularly in the early 
                                                         4
                       decades of the UK rail industry.  Today’s big audit firms have their roots in, 
                                                                          th
                       and indeed often retain the names of, these 19  century pioneers.  
               1.8     Unfortunately for its practitioners, audit falls into the category of services that 
                       only attract public commentary when things go wrong. And the last 20 years 
                       have seen plenty such commentary, both in the UK and elsewhere, as well as 
                       various reviews finding audits to be sub-standard. A sample is below.  
                       (a)  Enron and Andersen. Enron, the seventh largest company in the United 
                           States, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 after it was found to have misinformed 
                           about its profits. Having failed to reveal Enron’s flawed accounting, its 
                           auditor at the time, Arthur Andersen, came under intense scrutiny and 
                           was found guilty of deliberately destroying evidence of its relationship with 
                                  5
                           Enron.  Although this conviction was subsequently overturned by the

                             United States’ Supreme Court, the incident is widely perceived to have 
                             contributed to the collapse of Arthur Andersen.  
                             Reflecting on these significant corporate failures, one commentator 
                             suggested ‘the consequences of Enron’s directors’ clubbiness…were 
                             compounded by conflicts at Andersen, which earned more from consulting 
                                                                             6
                             for Enron than from monitoring its books’.  
                        (b)  Bank failures during the 2008 financial crisis. According to a House of 
                             Lords committee: ‘We do not accept the defence that bank auditors did all 
                             that was required of them. In the light of what we now know, that defence 
                             appears disconcertingly complacent. It may be that the Big Four carried 
                             out their duties properly in the strictly legal sense, but we have to 
                                                                                          7
                             conclude that, in the wider sense, they did not do so.’   
                              
                             And similarly, according to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking 
                             Standards: ‘Auditors and accounting standards have a duty to ensure the 
                             provision of accurate information to shareholders and others about 
                             companies’ financial positions. They fell down in that duty. Auditors failed 
                             to act decisively and fully to expose risks being added to balance sheets 
                             throughout the period of highly leveraged banking expansion. Audited 
                             accounts conspicuously failed accurately to inform their users about the 
                                                              8
                             financial condition of banks.’   
                              
                             According to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) 
                             Investor Advisory Group: ‘The recent financial crisis presented auditors, 
                             and by extension the Sarbanes-Oxley Act audit reforms, with their first big 
                             test since these reforms were put into place. By any objective measure, 
                                                    9
                             they failed that test.’  
                1.9     More recent examples include:  
                        (a)  BHS’s demise and PwC’s failings. Both PwC and the individual audit 
                             partner admitted misconduct in their audits of BHS and the Taveta Group, 
                             which owned it, following BHS’s sale to Dominic Chappell and its 
                             subsequent demise in 2016.

                       (b)  Carillion’s failure. In early 2018, Carillion, a British multinational facilities 
                            management and construction services company which was at the time 
                            audited by KPMG, went into liquidation. This collapse led to project 
                            shutdowns and delays, job losses, and financial losses, including to 
                            Carillion’s 30,000 suppliers, generating widespread public and political 
                            concerns. According to two House of Commons committees: ‘KPMG’s 
                            long and complacent tenure auditing Carillion was not an isolated failure. 
                            It was symptomatic of a market which works for the members of the 
                                                                      10
                            oligopoly but fails the wider economy’.  
                       (c)  2018 FRC Audit Quality Review (AQR) findings. In its most recent 
                            AQR, the FRC found that there was a decline in quality for all of the Big 
                            Four, and an ‘unacceptable deterioration’ at KPMG, while the four 
                                                                                             11
                            challenger firms reviewed showed ‘general improvements’.  
                       (d)  Other FRC enforcement findings. In May 2018, the FRC announced it 
                            had delivered formal complaints in respect of Deloitte’s audit of Autonomy 
                            Corporation plc including an alleged failure by Deloitte to adequately 
                            challenge the company’s accounting and disclosure of purchases and 
                                                            12
                            sales of computer hardware.  In July 2018, the FRC announced an 
                            investigation into the audit by KPMG of Conviviality plc, which went into 
                                                           13
                            administration in April 2018.  In August 2018, the FRC announced a 
                            severe reprimand and fine of £3 million for KPMG, and a separate 
                            reprimand and fine of £80,000 for one of its audit partners, after the FRC 
                                                                                                  14
                            found misconduct in respect of KPMG’s audit of Ted Baker plc.   
                       (e)  Other international cases. In 2016, senior staff at KPMG’s South Africa 
                            division resigned following audit failures linked to a wider political 
                            corruption scandal surrounding the Gupta family. KPMG had audited 
                            various Gupta family businesses for fifteen years but its staff were found 
                            to have failed to act on warnings regarding the integrity and ethics of the 
                                   15

               1.10  Over the same period, regulators, governments and other authorities have 
                      made attempts to improve audits.  
                      (a)  The Competition Commission (CC) conducted a market investigation into 
                          statutory audit services between 2011 and 2013, resulting in an Order that 
                                                                17
                          came into force on 1 January 2015.  The CC identified several features 
                                        18
                          of the market  that were leading to adverse effects on competition and 
                          decided on a package of remedies with a number of elements. These 
                          remedies included mandatory tendering of audit contracts by the 
                          FTSE 350 companies at least every ten years, greater review of audits by 
                          the FRC, greater shareholder engagement with company management on 
                          audits, greater accountability of auditors to Audit Committees, and a 
                                                                                           19
                          recommendation for the FRC to have a competition objective.  
                      (b)  In light of concerns about EU audit markets similar to those investigated 
                          by the CC in the UK, the European Commission introduced legislative 
                          change. This came into force in June 2016. This legislation closely 
                          mirrored the CC’s remedies, and introduced several additional reforms 
                          including mandatory switching of audit contracts for Public Interest 
                          Entities (PIEs) (which in the UK is required at least every twenty years), 
                          and placed obligations specifically on PIEs in connection with auditor 
                          appointments.  
                      (c)  The Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016 
                          (SATCAR 2016), which came into effect in June 2016, implemented the 
                          EU legislation in the UK. SATCAR 2016 designated the FRC as the UK’s 
                          Competent Authority responsible for public oversight of statutory auditors. 
                          SATCAR 2016 also amended the Companies Act 2006 to reflect the EU 
                          reforms, including the process for auditor appointments, retendering and 
                                   20
                          rotation.  
                      (d)  In the United States, in response to major corporate failures such as 
                          Enron, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) was passed (often referred to as 
                          SOX). The Act introduced major changes to the regulation of financial 
                          practice and corporate governance. For audit, the changes included 
                          establishing standards for external audit independence, introducing audit

               as experience and reputational hurdles; company management’s ability to influence auditors; and information

                           partner rotation, and restricting auditors from providing non-audit services 
                           for audit clients. An overarching oversight board (the PCAOB) was also 
                                                    21
                           established by the Act.  
               1.11  In the last six months, public commentary on audit problems has continued. 
                       One investor has suggested: ‘many of the worries centre on audit quality… 
                       Did the auditors challenge enough? Did they actually ask whether the 
                       accounts met the higher order true and fair view test? This is not as simple as 
                                                                       22
                       robotic adherence to accounting standards.’  Politicians have described audit 
                                            23
                       as ‘a failing market’  and suggested there have been ‘structural problems 
                                                  24
                       over far too many years.’  A recent report for the Labour Party suggested that 
                       auditors have been ‘unable to deliver independent and robust audits and the 
                       auditing industry is in disarray, dysfunctional and stumbles from one crisis to 
                                25
                       another’.  Academics and experts have stated ‘the culture and ethics of 
                                                                                        26
                       auditing have failed miserably at too high a cost to society.’   
               1.12  As the comments above indicate, there remain concerns despite the changes 
                       to improve audits; we explain in section two the extent to which the changes 
                       have made improvements or left issues unresolved.  
               How we have examined these concerns  
               1.13  We have gathered a range of evidence and views, including from the 
                       following: 
                       (a)  75 responses to our invitation to comment document;  
                       (b)  Information request responses from nine audit firms and 31 companies; 
                           and 
                       (c)  Over 60 telephone calls or face-to-face meetings with auditors, investors, 
                           companies, other public authorities, and other interested parties.  
               1.14  Appendix A sets out more detail on how we have conducted the study so far.

               2.     Market context and outcomes 
               2.1    In this section, we cover: 
                      (a)  Market context, including the characteristics of the statutory audit market 
                           and changes in the market in recent years;  
                      (b)  Audit quality, including what the different indicators of quality show; and  
                      (c)  The ‘expectations gap’ and the role of audit. 
               Overview  
               2.2    The statutory audit market has changed significantly over the past five years 
                      following the introduction of the CC and European Commission remedies. 
                      Mandatory tendering has led to a much higher rate of tendering and switching 
                      of auditors than previously. The switching process appears to have worked 
                      well, and in some cases has led to improvements in the quality of the audit 
                      process.  
               2.3    However, switching by the FTSE350 has been almost entirely between the 
                      Big Four auditors. The Big Four still account for over 97% of audit clients in 
                      the FTSE 350 and over 99% of audit fees. The challenger firms have won 
                      only a handful of FTSE 350 audit contracts. This is in spite of the fact that the 
                      larger challenger firms have grown their overall UK audit revenues more 
                      strongly than the Big Four and that they have similar levels of profitability.  
               2.4    The unanimous view of stakeholders is that the most important outcome in 
                      this market is audit quality. This means in particular that the auditor should 
                      provide sufficient professional scepticism and challenge of company 
                      accounts.  
                                                                                     27
               2.5    There are widespread public concerns about audit quality.  On the whole, 
                      Audit Committee Chairs (ACCs) did not share the view that there was a 
                      systemic and significant quality problem. However, the views of investors – 
                      who are the ultimate customers for statutory audit – were more mixed. Many 
                      stakeholders argued that the public concerns arise in part from an expectation 
                      gap about the role of audit, and we heard various views about how the role of 
                      audit should change in the future.  
                
                
               27
                  See paragraphs 1.7 to 1.11 above for a summary of these public concerns.  
                                                            17 
                                                                                                                
                2.6    However, while the arguments around the role of audit are important, the 
                       evidence nevertheless suggests that audit quality is not as high as it should 
                       be in a well-functioning market. In particular:  
                       (a)  In spite of the previous remedies put in place by the CC and the EU, there 
                            has been a persistent failure of the sector as a whole to meet the FRC’s 
                            AQR targets for quality; 
                       (b)  There have been a number of audit failures in recent years and cases of 
                            enforcement action by the FRC reflecting concerns about lack of 
                            challenge and professional scepticism; and  
                       (c)  The auditors themselves accept that there is a problem that needs to be 
                            addressed. They share the view that it is important to rebuild trust in the 
                            sector.  
                Market context  
                2.7    This section sets out background on the market for large company audits in 
                       the UK. We focus particularly on changes since the last CC report.  
                Legal requirements 
                2.8    The Companies Act 2006, and various domestic codes and regulations, set 
                       out legal requirements in respect of statutory audit in the UK, including 
                       reflecting elements of the European legislative framework. The key pieces of 
                                                                                              28
                       European legislation in respect of audits are the Audit Directive  and Audit

                        FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices is also shown in Figure 2.1. The audit fees 
                        paid by companies in the FTSE 100 have been between 77% and 80% of the 
                                                                         40

                        and the long tail of other companies in the FTSE 350. Figure 2.2 shows that 
                        the top 71 audit fees from FTSE 350 companies make up 80% of the total, 
                        whereas the smallest 80 fees account for only 1% of total in the FTSE 350.

                   2.13  This variation in fees reflects significant differences in audit complexity within 
                            the FTSE 350. Several of the auditors suggested that there are in fact at least 
                            two audit markets within the FTSE 350: the top end, comprising perhaps 30 or 
                            40 companies with particularly complex audits; and a longer tail of companies 
                            with relatively less complex audit requirements. This complexity can be 
                            driven, among other things, by the international scope of the business and the 
                            degree to which the audit requires specific technical knowledge and 
                            processes (for example in financial services).

                            audit fees paid in the FTSE 350), followed by Manufacturing (17%) and 
                            Mining and Quarrying (16%). Companies from these three sectors account for 
                            43 of the 71 companies that make up 80% of the total audit fees paid by 
                                                                    42

                2.15  Outside of the FTSE350 companies, we have gathered data on large private 
                        companies (the ‘Top Track 100’). Our analysis has found a similarly large 
                        variation in the audit fees paid by companies in this index – suggesting that 
                        private companies range significantly in audit complexity and scope. The 
                        largest private companies (such as Dyson and John Lewis Partnership) have 
                                                                                                     43
                        audit fees that are comparable to companies listed in the FTSE 250.  
                Market shares 
                2.16  The Big Four firms were the statutory auditor for 84% of all UK PIEs in 2017, 
                        whereas the five largest challenger firms were the statutory auditor for 13% of 
                                     44
                        all UK PIEs.   
                2.17  This difference between the Big Four and challenger firms is starker in the 
                        FTSE 350, where the overall share of the Big Four by number of audit clients 
                        has remained stable since 2011 – increasing slightly from 95% to 97% in 
                              45
                        2017.  The only challenger firms that audited a FTSE 350 company in 2017 
                        were BDO and Grant Thornton, having five and four respectively FTSE 350 
                                                46
                        audit clients that year.  In comparison, these two audit firms had nine and 
                        seven respectively in 2011. Only one FTSE 100 company is audited by a 
                        challenger firm (Randgold, which is audited by BDO).

                2.18  The high combined share of the Big Four firms is also found when considering 
                        their share of audit fees paid by FTSE 350 companies. Figure 2.4 shows that, 
                        while each of the Big Four firms received between 20% and 35% of the audit 
                        fees paid by FTSE 350 companies in 2018, the challenger firms combined 
                        had less than a 1% share. Taken together with their share of audit clients in 
                        the FTSE 350, this suggests that not only do the Big Four firms carry out the 
                        more complex audits required for the top end of the index (which receive the 
                        highest audit fees paid by companies) but they also have a number of audit 
                        clients with relatively less complex audit requirements.

                2.19  Outside of companies in the FTSE 350, we have gathered evidence that the 
                        Big Four firms received a sizeable proportion of the audit fees paid by smaller 
                        listed companies. A survey of the FTSE AIM 100 conducted by Accountancy 
                        found that the Big Four receive 86% of audit fees paid by companies in 2017, 
                        with the top 20 companies by audit fee value all audited by one of the Big

                        Four firms.       Our analysis of private companies in the Top Track 100 found 
                        that, for the years 2012 – 2017, the Big Four firms carried out the audit for 
                        around two-thirds of the companies included in the index, receiving 85% to 
                                                      49

                Top Track 100 in each year (either as they are not audited or as information was not available for some 
                companies on the FAME database). This means that the estimated Big Four share of audit clients could be an 
                underestimate and audit fees could be an overestimate.

               Tendering and switching 
               2.20  Our analysis has found that over half of FTSE 350 companies have tendered 
                      their external audit since 1 January 2013. Figure 2.5 shows the number of 
                      tenders in the FTSE 350 that were completed between January 2013 and 
                      October 2018, with the increased tendering in 2015 and 2016 likely due to the 
                      transition arrangements put in place as part of the CC and then EU audit 
                                  50

                      resulted in a switch of auditor.  As shown in Figure 2.6, we found that the 
                      overall annual switching rate for FTSE 350 audits grew from 6% in 2013 to 
                      14% in 2015, before falling to below 3% in 2018. When excluding those

                        the CC and EU remedies, we have found that switching has been almost 
                        entirely between the four largest auditors in the FTSE 350. This is shown in 
                        Figure 2.7, with 92% of tenders since 1 January 2013 resulting in a Big Four

                            2012 and 2017. This is shown in Figure 2.8, with an analysis conducted by 
                            the FRC showing a significant increase in the number of audit engagements 
                            with a tenure of less than five years – from 22% in 2012 to 47% in 2017.

                2.29  Figure 2.10 shows that the Big Four derive substantially more revenue from 
                       non-audit services than they do from audits. Across the Big Four as a whole, 
                       non-audit services accounted for 79% of total revenues in 2018 (a slight

                       increase from 77% in 2011).  Revenues earned on non-audit services 
                       exceed by a factor of four those earned on audit services.  
                2.30  There is some minor variation between the Big Four firms, with Deloitte 
                       deriving the largest share of revenue from non-audit services (83% in 2018). 
                       However, each of the Big Four generate at least three quarters of its revenue 
                       from non-audit services as shown in Figure 2.11.

                  Note that most of these non-audit fees come from clients for whom the firms do not provide audit services. As 
                illustrated in Figure 2.9, the non-audit fees provided to audit clients have been relatively small and falling in 
                recent years.

                       from audit services account for a higher proportion of total revenue compared 
                       with the Big Four). The challenger firms have seen stronger growth in audit 
                       revenues than the Big Four; since 2011, total audit revenues have grown in 
                       nominal terms by around 33% for the Big Four compared with 57% for the

               2.35  Figure 2.14 shows the same calculation for challenger firms. This shows that 
                       challenger firm revenues have increased at a faster rate than those of Big 
                       Four firms. EBIT margins have also increased over the period and are now 
                       similar to those achieved by Big Four firms.

                       revenues and aggregate EBIT margins, for the period 2011 to 2018. This 
                       shows that non-audit services revenues have increased at a faster rate than 
                       audit revenues. Again, margins have fallen from around [].

               Audit quality 
               2.37  There was unanimous agreement among stakeholders we spoke to that audit 
                       quality should be the key focus in assessing whether the market was 
                       producing good outcomes. A well-functioning market should produce high-
                       quality audits that are in the interests of shareholders and the wider public, 
                       delivered at a reasonable cost.  
               2.38  Unlike in some markets where there are concerns over whether the market is 
                       working well, there seem to be few complaints here that prices are too high. 
                       We have heard views that there might be merit in prices being higher in order 
                       to secure higher quality. 
               2.39  There is no single agreed definition of audit quality. The CC defined quality in 
                       terms of auditors’ scepticism, objectivity, integrity and independence. The 
                       ICAEW suggested that auditors provide a quality service to shareholders if 
                       they provide audit reports that are independent, reliable and supported by 
                                            66
                       adequate evidence.  We agree that high quality audit must involve producing 
                
                
               66
                  See for example https://www.icaew.com/-/media/corporate/files/technical/audit-and-assurance/audit-

                                                             30 
                                                 
          a well-evidenced, independent report. However, it is also crucially important 
          that auditors provide appropriate independent challenge and are willing to 
          take tough judgements, sometimes in the face of strong pressure from a 
          company’s management.  
       2.40  One of the key challenges in this market is that these aspects of quality are 
          very difficult to observe. While it may be possible to observe whether suitable 
          audit processes are in place and whether the audit report is properly 
          evidenced, it is much harder to assess whether an auditor is demonstrating 
          professional scepticism and independence.  
       2.41  In spite of these measurement challenges, several indicators suggest a 
          persistent problem of variable and sometimes poor audit quality. These issues 
          were identified by the CC in 2013. Despite the changes in the market since 
          then, similar quality concerns still remain. We have come to this conclusion 
          based on:  
          (a)  evidence of recent audit failures and FRC enforcement actions; 
          (b)  audit quality inspections; 
          (c)  international concerns over audit quality; and 
          (d)  stakeholder views. 
       Context of audit failures and FRC enforcement actions 
       2.42  In recent years a number of high profile cases of audit failures have been 
          exposed in the UK by corporate failures and fraud. Several of these audit 
          failures have led to FRC enforcement actions, as summarised in Figure 2.16.  
                           31 
                                                                                                         
               Figure 2.16: Summary of FRC enforcement findings and open enforcement cases 
                                                                                                         
                
               2.43  These failures appear not to be isolated incidents and have had significant 
                      wider impacts. For example, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association 
                      submitted that while there are good quality audits in the UK, ‘high profile 
                      failures or even the perception of failure can be extremely damaging to 
                                                         67
                      investor (and public) confidence’.  The level of concern was further 
                      expressed by the United Kingdom Shareholders Association, which submitted 
                
                
               67

                      that there is a concern that ‘shareholders can no longer rely on the audit and it 
                      is a matter of sheer luck that there have not been more major audit failures 
                                68
                      recently’.  One challenger firm commented that ‘many stakeholders have 
                      reduced confidence in the assurance provided by an audit report, when of 
                      course one of the key aims of an audit is to enhance the confidence of 
                                                                                                      69
                      stakeholders in the financial information that has been presented to them’.  
                      The corporate failures have caused financial harm and distress for 
                                                                                  70
                      employees, customers, suppliers and pension schemes.  
               2.44  Responsibility for recent corporate failures does not rest solely with the 
                      auditors. Indeed, some argue that the public commentary around audit 
                      failures reflects a misunderstanding of the role of audit – sometimes referred 
                      to as the ‘expectations gap’. We consider these arguments further below. 
                      However, had the auditors identified and exposed problems earlier, this would 
                      have provided shareholders and other stakeholders with an opportunity to 
                      make informed decisions (including decisions that might have addressed the 
                      problems or mitigated the impact).  
               2.45  In most cases, these failures came to light as a result of corporate failure or 
                      other financial problems (such as profit warnings), or instances of fraudulent 
                                                             71
                      or corrupt behaviour coming to light.  That these audit failures became 
                      apparent only when the companies in question collapsed (or following some 
                      other external event) must give rise to concern that there are quite likely a 
                      wider set of audit problems that never come to light.  
               2.46  We reviewed the FRC enforcement findings for the cases concluded since 
                      2015 against the five largest audit firms set out in Figure 2.17. Based on our 
                      analysis, the most frequent reasons for findings of misconduct include:  
                      (a)  failure to exercise sufficient professional scepticism or to challenge 
                           management (most cases);  
                      (b)  failure to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence (most cases); and 
                      (c)  loss of independence (three out of a total of 11 cases).

               2.47  The FRC told us that all its recent enforcement findings have to some extent 
                      related to a lack of sufficient professional scepticism or challenge by the 
                      auditor. This suggests to us that the enforcement cases reflect underlying 
                      quality concerns.  
               FRC AQR results 
               2.48  Each year the FRC reviews a sample of audits and related procedures 
                      supporting audit quality (firm-wide procedures) at individual audit firms. The 
                      results are published in the FRC’s Developments in Audit report, which 
                      summarises the result of the audit inspections and firm-specific reports (with 
                      annual reviews and a public report for each of Big Four audit firms, BDO, 
                      Grant Thornton and Mazars). Confidential reports on individual audits 
                      reviewed are given to the relevant audit firms and ACCs. 
               2.49  We heard criticism from some investors and ACCs that the reports on 
                      individual audits focus primarily on the quality of the audit process rather than 
                      the underlying professional judgements. Nevertheless, the results are a key 
                      public indicator of audit quality and are used by companies in the selection of 
                      their external auditor. 
               Individual audit inspections 
               2.50  The individual audit reviews focus on the appropriateness of key audit 
                      judgements made in reaching the audit opinion and the sufficiency and 
                      appropriateness of the audit evidence obtained. All audits are graded as 
                      either good, limited improvements required, improvements required, or 
                      significant improvements required. The FRC considers whether enforcement 
                      action is appropriate for all inspections assessed as requiring improvements 
                      or significant improvements.  
               2.51  The CC recommended that the FRC inspect audit engagements on average 
                      every five years, with each individual engagement inspected at least every 
                      seven years. In any year, the selection of audits is based on a number of 
                      factors including the assessed risk in relation to the entity and particular 
                      priority sectors (i.e. it is not a random sample). This means that findings may 
                      not be representative of the population of FTSE350 audits and we need to be 
                                                                              72
                      particularly cautious in interpreting trends over time.   
                
                
               72
                 FRC, Developments in Audit 2018, p6, states that ‘Changes to the proportion of audits falling within each 
               category from year to year reflect a wide range of factors, which may include the size, complexity and risk of the 
               individual audits selected for review and the scope of the individual reviews. For this reason, and given the 
               sample sizes involved, changes from one year to the next are not necessarily indicative of any overall change in 
               audit quality at the firm.’   
                                                           34 
                                                                                                                 
                2.52  The FRC has a target of 90% of FTSE 350 audits requiring no more than 
                        limited improvements. An audit will be assessed as requiring significant 
                        improvements where the FRC has ‘significant concerns in relation to the 
                        sufficiency or quality of audit evidence, or the appropriateness of key audit 
                        judgments, or the implications of other matters are individually or collectively 
                                    73
                        significant’.  
                2.53  The FRC has expressed ongoing concern and frustration with the failure of 
                        firms to address recurring problems. These include a lack of professional 
                        scepticism exercised by auditors when auditing key judgement areas and 
                        failure to adequately challenge management’s assumptions. The FRC 
                        identified bank audits, group audit oversight and the audit of pension balances 
                                                          74
                        as particular areas of concern.  
                2.54  Figure 2.17 shows the percentage of FTSE 350 and non-FTSE 350 audits 
                        inspected by the FRC assessed as good or requiring limited improvement 
                        over the period 2011/12 to 2017/18. In 2017/18, just 73% of FTSE 350 audits 
                                                                                        75
                        were assessed as good or requiring limited improvement.  This figure is well 
                        short of the FRC’s target.

                 2.55  The FRC also provides AQR results by firm.  In 2017/18, for Big Four firms 
                         only, 23% of FTSE 350 audits required improvement and 3% significant 
                         improvement. Over the five-year period, the figures were 20% and 4% 
                         respectively for the Big Four firms and 18% and 18% respectively for the

                 2.56  Figure 2.18 shows for Big Four and challenger firms the percentage of audits 
                         inspected rated as ‘good or limited improvement required’, ‘improvement 
                         required’ and ‘significant improvement required, over the last five years. For 
                         Big Four firms this is limited to FTSE 350 audits. For challenger firms it is all 
                         audits.

                 2.57  We reviewed the individual AQR reports which led to a finding of ‘significant 
                         improvements required’. In a high proportion of these, the concerns related to 
                         a lack of professional scepticism and challenge – they were not simply failures 
                         of process. This again suggests to us that there may be a systemic problem of 
                         insufficient challenge across a substantial portion of large company audits.

                             scepticism’ and ‘challenging company assumptions’ as areas where 
                             improvement was required. Further areas requiring improvement included:

                    2.61  This evidence suggests that some of the same market issues present in the 
                             UK are likely to apply to auditors overseas. It emphasises the importance of 
                             ensuring that the underlying causes of poor quality are tackled.  
                    Views of stakeholders on audit quality 
                    2.62  Overall, the balance of views from Audit Committees and investors was that 
                             audit in the UK is generally of a high quality. Many stakeholders pointed to the 
                             fact that the UK has a high reputation internationally for the quality of its audit 
                             firms. Several ACCs also commented that switching auditor had led to an 
                             improvement in quality, as new auditors brought a fresh perspective and new 
                             processes and technologies. This positive overall view of quality is also 
                             reflected in the recent FRC survey of ACCs, which suggested that 86 per cent 
                             of respondents rated their external auditor as either ‘excellent’ or ‘above 
                                          97
                             average’.   
                    2.63  Nonetheless, this was not a universal view. Most customers did accept that 
                             there was at least a variation in audit quality, and that some recent cases 
                             highlighted serious quality problems. The main debate was over whether 
                             these examples reflected isolated incidents or a more systemic concern about 
                             the incentives on auditors to do a good job.

               2.64  Some investors expressed a view that there were significant quality 
                                  98
                       problems.  Legal & General Investment Management said that they ‘feel let 
                       down by poor audit quality’ and ‘believe that trust in audit has been shaken 
                       due to the recent high profile accounting scandals’. Hermes expressed 
                       concerns in relation to auditor independence and integrity and their ability to 
                       challenge management. The Investment Association stated that ‘too often 
                       audit firms consider the audited entity to be their clients. It is a company’s 
                       shareholders that rely on the auditor’s work and to whom the auditor 
                                99
                       reports’.  
               2.65  Schroders said that there continue to be too many examples of corporate 
                       failures and poor annual report disclosures that do not adequately identify the 
                       risks of business. Audit firms can and should do more to ensure that 
                       companies clearly and unambiguously report the underlying business and 
                       financial risks that they face along with the significant estimates and 
                       judgements that have been made in preparing the financial results. Where the 
                       auditors believe that this is not the case, the auditors must be robust in 
                       fulfilling their existing responsibilities to report these matters to shareholders.  
                                                                                     100
               2.66  Others said that they had confidence in UK audit overall.          However, there 
                       was also the view that while the instances of audit failures have been 
                       relatively isolated events, when they do occur they can have serious 
                                    101
                       implications.     
               ‘Expectations gap’ and the purpose and scope of audit 
               2.67  In response to our concerns about audit quality, respondents highlighted the 
                       importance of first understanding the purpose and scope of audit before 
                       assessing whether audit was failing to meet its designed objectives. We heard 
                       different perspectives on both what the purpose of audit was and whether it 
                       was meeting that purpose. A common theme amongst respondents’ 
                       submissions was the existence or otherwise of an ‘expectations gap’.  
               2.68  Many respondents argued that audit quality concerns arise because there is a 
                       mismatch between what the statutory framework requires of auditors and the

                        public’s expectations of what auditors do – the ‘expectations gap’.           
                        Respondents submitted a range of views on causes and solutions for this 
                        issue. Several emphasised a misunderstanding about the roles and 
                                                                                                      103
                        responsibilities of auditors as compared with the company’s directors.            
                        Some said that while there might be an expectations gap for the general 
                        public, informed shareholders understand the scope and limitations of 
                                        104
                        statutory audit.    Some respondents called for greater education for all 
                                       105
                        stakeholders.       
                2.69  Other respondents argued that the expectations gap was a fallacy hiding a 
                        more fundamental problem: that the industry is incorrectly interpreting and 
                        applying the existing statutory framework. They argued that, if the framework 
                        was properly applied, there would be no expectations gap.  
                2.70  Although these issues go beyond the CMA’s core remit, they form important 
                        context for our assessment of whether the market is working well. As one 
                        respondent put it, unless we are clear on the scope and purpose of audit, it is 
                                                                                                 106
                        difficult to comment meaningfully on the quality of audit provision.         These 
                        issues evidence the nuanced range of both the causes of, and potential 
                        solutions to, declining audit quality.  
                2.71  There is a strong case for reviewing the purpose and scope of audit to 
                        consider these issues holistically. In Appendix C we set out in more detail the 
                        range of issues that have been put to us and what questions might be 
                        covered by the expected review.  
                2.72  However, the expectations gap and discussion over the role of audit do not 
                        remove the real concerns around audit quality set out in the previous section. 
                        An effect of reviewing the purpose and scope of audit might well be to raise 
                        the requirement for what is expected of auditors, to clarify the purpose of 
                        audit, or to change the purpose. None of that would alter the fact that audits 
                        too often fall short of the current requirement. Changing the purpose and 
                        scope of audit would not alter the incentives and interests at play; whatever 
                        the purpose and scope, the market needs to operate in a way which creates 
                        the incentives to prioritise quality.

       Conclusion on audit quality 
       2.73  Audit quality is difficult to observe. This means that shareholders and other 
          users are reliant on the oversight provided by Audit Committees and 
          regulators. ACCs have themselves told us that it is difficult to judge quality.  
       2.74  In recent years a number of high profile cases of audit failures have been 
          exposed by corporate failures and fraud. Poor quality is likely to be more 
          widespread (but not exposed by other events).  
       2.75  While audit failures were not solely responsible for corporate failure, had 
          auditors carried out their work to a higher standard it is possible that the 
          commercial or other problems could have been identified earlier. This would 
          have allowed those affected to have made better informed decisions. This 
          point is not limited to the cases where poor audit quality is exposed by for 
          example, corporate failure.  
       2.76  The potential impact of audit failures is wide. This is illustrated by the financial 
          harm and distress to many people caused by corporate failures, including to 
          members of pensions scheme, owners and employees of suppliers, 
          customers. In the case of Carillion, there was harm also to the taxpayer and 
          users of public services.  
       2.77  These cases have also undermined public trust in corporate governance and 
          audit. Reliable financial information is essential to effective corporate 
          governance.  
       2.78  All this means that the number of recent events, combined with the size of 
          these companies and their importance to UK economy, cannot be dismissed 
          as ‘isolated events’.

             3.    Issues 
             Introduction 
             3.1   The previous section summarised our concerns that the audit market is not 
                   currently delivering consistently high quality. This section sets out our view on 
                   what is driving these quality concerns.  
             3.2   In a well-functioning market, competition and regulation would combine to 
                   ensure the right incentives through a variety of mechanisms.  
                   (a)  Selection and oversight of auditors would ensure that competition would 
                       be focused on quality (more than price), so that firms win more business if 
                       they deliver good quality and lose if their quality is poor.  
                   (b)  There would be enough opportunities to compete, and there would be 
                       sufficient choice of viable competitors over the long term, without undue 
                       barriers to entry and expansion, all to enable intense competition.  
                   (c)  Within firms, individual auditors’ personal success would depend to a very 
                       large extent on whether they deliver high-quality audits.  
                   (d)  Regulation would shine a light on quality levels and punish sub-standard 
                       performance both by firms and by individuals. This would also support 
                       competition on quality because buyers would have better information on a 
                       service whose quality is otherwise hard to judge.  
             3.3   Previous interventions have attempted to make these mechanisms work more 
                   effectively. For instance, CC remedies strengthening audit committees have 
                   brought about some changes in the way auditors are selected and overseen; 
                   the CC and EU mandatory tendering and rotation remedies addressed parts 
                   of (b); regulation has attempted to improve (c), for example through bans on 
                   incentives on audit partners to cross-sell non-audit services; and the CC’s 
                   recommendations for more, and more frequent AQRs related to (d).  
             3.4   But as the outcomes described in the previous section show, current 
                   incentives are insufficient to produce consistently high quality. This section 
                   considers the various possible incentive mechanisms in turn.  
                   (a)  Selection and oversight of auditors is insufficiently focused on quality. 
                       Audit Committees are only a partial solution to the underlying problem that 
                       companies procure their own audits. 
                   (b)  Choice. There are limitations on choice, driven by a combination of 
                       regulatory requirements, firms’ structure, and barriers to competition from 
                                                  42 
                                                                                                                
                            challenger firms; as well as concerns over the long-term resilience of the 
                            sector.  
                       (c)  Firms’ structure. The structure of accounting firms results in weaker 
                            incentives to deliver high-quality audits, because a significant majority of 
                            the firms’ business is outside audit.  
                       (d)  Regulation. The general quality of regulation has been considered 
                            alongside this study by the independent review of the FRC, led by Sir 
                            John Kingman, so we do not consider that subject here, beyond noting 
                            that various stakeholders have reinforced the Carillion Select Committee’s 
                                                                           107
                            view that regulation has been inadequate.          
                Selection and oversight of auditors 
                3.5    The very existence of statutory audit reflects the incentive challenges at the 
                       heart of modern corporate governance structures. Within a public limited 
                       company, the separation of ownership and control creates a ‘principal-agent’ 
                       problem – the owners want the managers to run the company in their interests 
                       but can only partially observe the actions of those managers. Statutory audit 
                       has evolved as a way of lessening this principal-agent problem. By appointing 
                       an independent auditor to validate the financial accounts produced by 
                       management, owners and the wider public can have confidence in the 
                       company’s financial figures, which in turn gives managers a stronger incentive 
                       to act in the interests of the company’s owners.  
                3.6    Within this framework, a key challenge is how to ensure that the auditors are 
                       acting in the interests of the company’s owners rather than in the interests of 
                       the company’s managers. Since auditors need to work closely with a 
                       company’s managers on a day-to-day basis in order to carry out an audit, how 
                       can owners know whether the auditors are challenging the managers 
                                     108
                       sufficiently?     
                3.7    In the current corporate governance model for large companies, Audit 
                       Committees play a key role in representing the interests of owners 
                       (shareholders) and ensuring that incentives are aligned. According to 
                                                           109

                   Prof Prem Sikka et al. noted that, ‘Ever since the inception of modern audits there have been concerns about 
                company directors selecting and remunerating auditors and thereby defeating the very concept of an 
                independent audit.’ Reforming the auditing industry, December 2018.

                Committees-April-2016.pdf.  
                                                              43 
                                                                                                          
                      interests of the company, the Audit Committee has a particular role, acting 
                      independently from the executive, to ensure that the interests of shareholders 
                      are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control. 
                      The CC put in place a package of measures to strengthen the position of 
                      Audit Committees, to enhance the accountability of the Audit Committees to 
                      shareholders and to promote shareholder engagement in the audit process, 
                      including by promoting information flow between companies and investors in 
                      relation to the external audit.  
               3.8    We have considered the effectiveness of the current framework in creating 
                      strong incentives for high quality audit. We have found that there are limits to 
                      what we can expect from shareholders in providing oversight of the conduct of 
                      the audit committee or, directly, of the audit itself. There is little direct investor 
                      engagement in audit issues. It is very rare for investors to reject the 
                      appointment of an auditor. Investors argued that this was partly a function of 
                      lack of transparency about the detail of the audit – they argued that if there 
                      was more information available about e.g. key audit issues then they would 
                      have an incentive to be more engaged.  
               3.9    This means that the system is very reliant on Audit Committees, and ACCs in 
                      particular, in driving audit quality. We found that the CC’s remedies have 
                      strengthened the role of the Audit Committee particularly in the appointment 
                      of the auditor. All the ACCs that we spoke to were clear that their duty is to 
                      provide an independent function representing the interests of shareholders 
                      and valued the professional scepticism and challenge of the auditors.  
               3.10  However, Audit Committees cannot observe directly the quality of the audit 
                      work undertaken. Rather, Audit Committees will discuss with the auditors the 
                      work performed on areas of higher audit risk and the basis for the auditors’ 
                      conclusions on those areas, supplemented by their other interactions with the 
                      auditors.  
               3.11  Overall, this makes the whole system fragile, by diluting the incentives on 
                      auditors to focus on providing high quality audit based on professional 
                      scepticism and challenge.  
               3.12  There are aspects of this framework that could work better in driving good 
                      audit quality. In particular, we set out below findings in relation to the 
                      following:  
                      (a)  The process for the selection of auditors, including the selection criteria 
                          and the role and influence of company managers in these processes.  
                      (b)  The variation in the resources available to Audit Committees and the 
                          approach taken by Audit Committees.  
                                                           44 
                                                                                                              
                       (c)  The lack of transparency for investors on the quality of audit work and the 
                           potential for more information to promote shareholder engagement.  
                       (d)  The alignment of the interests of company shareholders in audit quality 
                           with the wider public interest in the publication of independently verified 
                           financial information.  
               Selection processes for audit tenders 
               3.13  We found that aspects of the selection processes could result in the selection 
                       of auditors with the interests of the company and its management rather than 
                       those of the shareholders, in mind. In particular, we examined the criteria 
                       used in the evaluation of bids and the involvement of management in the 
                       tender process.  
               Selection criteria 
               3.14  We asked a sample of companies that had recently carried out tenders to 
                                                                               110
                       provide us with details of their selection processes.      We also collected 
                       information from the auditors on all the tenders that they had participated in 
                       over the past five years. We used this evidence to understand how companies 
                       evaluate bids.  
               3.15  Overall, the evidence from recent tenders suggests that quality is typically 
                       viewed as more important than price, which matches the preferences of most 
                       shareholders and other stakeholders. However, in some tenders, factors such 
                       as ‘cultural fit’ are considered to a greater extent than factors such as the 
                       degree of challenge and scrutiny that the auditor is expected to demonstrate. 
                       This calls into question the weight given in auditor selection to independence, 
                       scepticism and ability to challenge, the main attributes Audit Committees 
                       should be demanding of them. 
                       Importance of price in judging tenders 
               3.16  We found that bids are typically evaluated against a list of criteria. While the 
                       list varies from company to company, the criteria will, in addition to price, 
                       usually include:  
                       (a)  experience and technical capability of the audit partner, the audit team 
                           and the firm; 
                
                
               110
                  See Appendix A for details of the approach taken to sampling.  
                                                             45 
                                                                                                           
                      (b)  geographic coverage of the firm’s network; 
                      (c)  understanding of the company’s business and industry knowledge; and 
                      (d)  working relations with senior management. 
               3.17  Some stakeholders have raised concerns that too much weight is attached to 
                      price as ‘a company’s managers may value lower pricing over a rigorous audit 
                                111
                      process’,     and that competition is putting downward pressure on price to the 
                      detriment of quality. We found little evidence to support a claim that Audit 
                      Committees focus overly on price in the selection of auditors.  
               3.18  There was general agreement among the ACCs that we spoke to that audit 
                      quality should matter more than price. A number of ACCs stated that cost was 
                      not a significant determinant when selecting an auditor, with one Chair stating 
                      that in their experience ‘the prime concern of the audit committee has been to 
                                                                                                  112
                      ensure that the auditors perform a robust audit, unconstrained by fees’.         
               3.19  The 100 Group, which represents the views of FTSE 100 finance directors 
                      and several large UK private companies, stated that, in its experience, Audit 
                      Committees are focussed ‘on the quality and challenge provided by the audit 
                      firm. The cost of delivery is a relatively minor consideration in selecting an 
                      audit firm, with a greater weighting typically being applied to other factors 
                                                                                      113
                      such as quality, innovation, sector expertise and efficiency’.     
               3.20  It was not always clear from the documents provided by the companies 
                      precisely how much weight was attached to price relative to quality. However, 
                      based on data provided by the auditors we observed that the winning bid was 
                      not the cheapest bid in the majority of cases (56% of the 225 FTSE 350 
                                                                                                      114 
                      tenders for which we had data and where there were two or more bidders).            
               3.21  This is supported by our analysis of the audit fees received by the auditors of 
                      FTSE 350 companies in the period 2012 to 2017. We found that the audit fee 
                      paid to a newly appointed auditor in their first year was almost as likely to be 
                      lower (44%) as it was to be higher (46%) than the fee paid to the previous 
                                                                     115
                      auditor in the last year of their engagement.

                             ‘Cultural fit’ vs audit quality 
                    3.22  Aside from price, the criteria used by companies are similar to those listed in 
                                                                                        116,117
                             the FRC ‘good practice’ tender guidelines                           The main exceptions were 
                             criteria such as ‘easy to work with’, ‘cultural fit’ and ‘chemistry’. Such criteria 
                             raise concerns around independence of the auditor. The UKSA stated that 
                             when it comes to auditor appointment, large companies and public interest 
                             entities appear to take the position that ‘the only real requirement for selection

                    3.23  We looked at the information provided on evaluation criteria in our sample of 
                             recent audit tenders. Figure 2.20 shows the selection criteria applied by the 
                             sample of FTSE 350 companies. We found that 23 out of 24 FTSE 350

                             only nine explicitly included ‘exercising scepticism’ and/or ‘challenging

                       Includes any reference to, at least one, of the following: robust or thorough audit; challenging management; 
                    objectivity and exercising scepticism.  
                                                                              47 
                                                                                                              
               3.24  We also found evidence that factors like ‘cultural fit’ and ‘personal 
                       relationships’ have been important in auditor selection. For example: 
                       (a)  []. 
                       (b)  One of the main reasons why [] was not chosen by [] was ‘the lack of 
                           chemistry between the teams both internally to [] and with []’. 
                           Similarly, ‘the evaluation teams felt that [] were too blunt in their 
                           approach and it wouldn’t be a collaborative relationship’.  
                       (c)  A [] document outlining the assessment criteria states that ‘chemistry is 
                           probably the most important element’.  
               3.25  There are a variety of ways to interpret the phrase ‘cultural fit’. One ACC 
                       stated that this includes the audit partner displaying maturity in being able to 
                       deal with events in a calm and constructive manner, with the strength to make 
                       the right decisions. Interpersonal skills and an understanding of the 
                       organisation, its culture and ambitions may be relevant to an auditor’s ability 
                       to effectively question and challenge management. 
               3.26  There are also examples that suggest an interpretation and application that is 
                       contrary to what a ‘good auditor’ should be. For example, in []’s tender, [] 
                       scored well on ‘challenge and tension’ but poorly on ‘culture and style’. While 
                       in terms of ‘challenge and tension’ it was positively noted that a ‘lack of 
                       relationship building meant a bigger focus on what we do and how we do it’, 
                       the same ‘lack of focus on relationship building’ negatively affected the score 
                       on ‘culture and style’. The winning bidder, [], showed ‘not much challenge 
                       during the process’, therefore getting a low score on ‘challenge and tension’; 
                       but this was almost completely compensated by a high score on ‘culture and 
                       style’, based on (among other things), them being ‘relationship focussed’, 
                       showing ‘strong desire to work with [the company]’, and coming across as 
                                                                               121
                       ‘personable and approachable, with good humour’.           
               3.27  That terms like ‘cultural fit’ can be understood in different ways is also 
                       illustrated by the [] tender. Under the title of ‘cultural fit’, the audit committee 
                       considered, amongst other things, whether the ‘Lead Partner and team bring 
                       adequate challenge, courage and integrity’. However, under the same title 
                       they also considered how the Lead Partner and key team members will ‘fit 
                       with []’s culture’ and whether management could ‘work with this team’. 
                       These are very different considerations.  
                
                
               121
                  [] noted that, under "Technical expertise", the audit partner "confirmed that [] do not agree with [the] 
               accounting treatment of IBAs, and resisted challenge from [Finance Director] well".  
                                                             48 
                                                                                                               
                3.28  Overall, shareholder confidence in the appointment of auditors requires 
                       selection criteria to be transparent and to be focused on what matters for high 
                       quality audits – independence, scepticism and ability to challenge. The weight 
                       attributed to factors like ‘cultural fit’ and ‘chemistry’ calls into question whether 
                       the current tendering approach rewards auditors for being close to 
                       management, rather than providing independent challenge.  
                Role of management in audit appointments  
                3.29  Based on submissions received from investors and shareholder 
                       representatives, it appears that the last few years have seen an increasing 
                       involvement of Audit Committees in the appointment of auditors, with choices 
                       based more on audit quality than on price. However, some investors told us 
                       that there is still an excessive involvement of companies’ CFOs and top 
                                                                               122
                       management in the conduct of the tender process.             
                3.30  Based on the evidence we gathered on 24 FTSE 350 tenders, it appears that 
                       Audit Committees are now actively involved in most, if not all stages, of the 
                       tender process. This includes the design of the process, the evaluation of 
                       bids, the final presentations by short-listed firms, and the decision on the 
                       recommendation to the board. The clearest examples we found of Audit 
                       Committees delegating heavily to management were before the CC order 
                       went into force. However, we observed that management still plays a 
                       significant role in the tender process and in advising the Audit Committee.  
                3.31  Senior management involvement in the selection process provides an 
                       opportunity for them to influence auditor appointment particularly given the 
                       importance attached to factors like ‘cultural fit’ and ‘chemistry’. This is 
                       illustrated by the []. While we recognise that some senior management 
                       involvement is inherent to the process, confidence in the selection requires 
                       Audit Committees to have effective oversight of the process at all stages.  
                3.32  The selection process would be a more effective driver of audit quality if the 
                       criteria applied were consistently focused on audit quality, and the 
                       participation of senior management in the process were kept to the minimum 
                       necessary for an effective selection process (taking into account the 
                       constraints on the time and resources that Audit Committee members could 
                       allocate to the process).

                Effectiveness of Audit Committees in overseeing auditors 
                3.33  Even if the Audit Committee appointed an auditor in a way that was 
                        completely aligned with the interests of shareholders, problems could still 
                        arise if auditors’ activities are not properly monitored. This could be the case, 
                        for example, if auditors get too ‘close’ to the company’s management and 
                        exercise insufficient scepticism or challenge. It could also simply reflect an 
                        incentive for auditors to minimise costs, given that audit quality is very difficult 
                        to observe unless things go wrong.  
                                                             123
                3.34  Guidance produced by the FRC               specifies that the Audit Committee should 
                        annually assess, and report to the board on, the qualification, expertise and 
                        resources, and independence of the external auditors and the effectiveness of 
                        the audit process. The Audit Committee should meet the external and internal 
                        auditors at least annually, without management. Moreover, it is expected that 
                        the Audit Committee Chair, and to a lesser extent the other members, will 
                        keep in touch on a continuing basis with the key people involved in the 
                        company’s governance, including the external audit lead partner.  
                3.35  Some of the investors responding to our ITC acknowledged that Audit 
                        Committees are increasingly involved in monitoring and evaluating the activity 
                                     124
                        of auditors.     However, concerns have been expressed on how 
                                                                       125
                        independently this activity is performed.         Several investors are concerned 
                        that Audit Committees do not sufficiently challenge management on their 
                        judgements or auditors on the depth of work and analysis they have 
                                      126
                        undertaken.       In particular, it was noted that in several cases Audit 
                        Committees appear to rely on executive feedback on the auditor as the main 
                        input into annual reviews of performance, therefore assessing auditors based 
                                                                                                      127
                        on the feedback from the very people whose work is being audited.                 More 
                        generally, it was noted that there is no statement of what constitutes best 
                                                                        128
                        practice in the area of auditor monitoring.         
                3.36  Members of the Audit Committee Chairs Independent Forum (ACCIF) told us 
                        that they felt confident in their ability to assess the quality of the key aspects 
                        of the audit of their companies, in particular by discussing with the auditors

                                                                50 
                                                                                                                              
                          the work performed on areas of higher audit risk and the basis for the 
                          auditors’ conclusions on those areas, supplemented by their other interactions 
                          with the auditors. That enabled them, for example, to gauge the depth of the 
                          auditors’ understanding of the company’s business. They were critical of the 
                          reviews conducted by the FRC. They felt that FRC reports are not sufficiently 
                          focussed on what matters to the quality of the audit outputs.  
                  3.37  Like its responsibilities in appointing auditors, the extent to which the Audit 
                          Committee might mitigate the principal-agent problem in relation to the 
                          monitoring of auditors depends on the resources it is provided with and on its 
                          independence of judgement.  
                  3.38  We have information from 18 FTSE 350 companies on the amount of time 
                          spent by Audit Committees on external audit related matters. We found that 
                          this varied significantly based on the size and complexity of the company. 
                          Figure 2.21 shows that, on average, Audit Committee members reported 
                          spending 55 hours on all their Audit Committee duties in the last financial 
                          year, and 23 hours on duties relating to the statutory audit. These figures are 
                          77 hours and 35 hours respectively for ACC.

                                       All AC duties      Duties relating to statutory audit
                                                                                                               
                  Note: We excluded from our analysis any AC member who had been appointed in the last 18 months to reduce the effect of 
                  individuals who had not been in post throughout the last full financial year. 
                   
                  3.39  However, these averages are significantly affected by the time spent by some 
                          Audit Committees. For example, for the largest company in our sample, the 
                          five audit committee members spent 1,030 hours on AC duties in the last full 
                          year.  
                  3.40  Taken as a whole, this evidence suggests that the amount of time and 
                          resources spent by Audit Committees varies significantly between companies 
                          (including between similar companies). We found that the total audit 
                                                                      51 
                                                                                                               
                       committee time spent on the external audit (excluding time spent on a tender), 
                       ranged from more than 400 person-hours in a year to less than 20 hours. This 
                       included several FTSE 100 companies recording less than 40 hours in a year. 
                       While this is not surprising given the variance in scale and complexity of 
                       companies within the FTSE 350, it raises a question about whether smaller 
                       and less well-resourced Audit Committees are properly able to oversee and 
                       monitor the activities of the statutory auditor. 
                3.41  For some, the hours suggest that Audit Committees cannot be taking as 
                                                                                            129
                       proactive a role as envisaged by the FRC. The FRC guidance               states that 
                       the ‘audit committee should consider key matters of their own initiative … 
                       discuss what information and assurance it requires in order to properly carry 
                       out its roles to review, monitor and provide assurance or recommendations to 
                       the board and, where there are gaps, how these should be addressed… 
                       satisfy itself that these sources of assurance and information are sufficient 
                       and objective.’  
                Degree of engagement by shareholders 
                3.42  Although the Audit Committee is meant to represent the interests of 
                       shareholders, in practice most stakeholders we spoke to suggested that 
                       investors have little engagement with audit matters. Several ACCs confirmed 
                       a lack of active engagement in audit matters by shareholders and other 
                       investors. 
                3.43  Shareholders have to approve the appointment of the auditor each year, but 
                       in most cases this appears to be a formality. One recent exception was the 
                       shareholder vote in May 2018 to reject the reappointment of Deloitte as 
                       auditor of SIG. This came after SIG admitted that it had overstated its profits 
                                               130
                       in previous accounts.        
                3.44  We are also aware of instances where investors and shareholder 
                       representatives have a degree of influence on audit firm appointment, 
                       potentially encouraging an Audit Committee to appoint a Big Four audit firm.  
                3.45  The investors we spoke to told us that this lack of engagement reflected a 
                       lack of transparency and information about the audit process. They said that 
                       often little information was provided about tender processes. Also, limited 
                       information is provided about issues and concerns raised by auditors, the 
                       reasons underlying the identification of key risks, and whether the Audit

                   The Financial Times, SIG shareholders reject reappointment of Deloitte as auditor, 10 May 2018. 
                                                              52 
                                                                                                            
                      Committee believe the audit has been challenging and the auditor has 
                      exercised professional scepticism. Communications to shareholders are 
                      generic and often based on answers to questionnaires drafted by audit firms.  
               3.46  Both investors and ACCs commented that the level of shareholder 
                      engagement on the external audits compares unfavourably with that on senior 
                      executive remuneration. For example, the Audit Committee Chair for National 
                      Express said that shareholders are ‘overly concerned’ with remuneration and 
                      should give more attention to the work of the audit committee and the external 
                      audit, which ultimately address greater systemic risk. Invesco Perpetual, in 
                      commenting on the scope for improvement, suggested adopting an approach 
                      similar to ‘AGM votes on remuneration reports and policies, AGM votes on 
                                                                         131
                      audit committee reports should be considered’.         
               3.47  On the disclosure of information to investors on appointments, FRC guidance 
                      states that: investors need to be aware at an early stage that the tender is 
                      taking place; companies should seek investor views to inform their choice of 
                      participating firms; investors should be informed on the firms being invited to 
                      tender; investors would like transparency on how potential conflicts have been 
                      mitigated and/or will be managed; and investors would like to know what 
                      factors led to the decision. 
               3.48  The lack of transparency is illustrated by our findings in relation to the 
                      information provided to shareholders on tenders of external audit 
                      engagements. We asked the sample of FTSE 350 companies to provide 
                      details of any direct communications with shareholders when the company 
                      last tendered the external audit. We found just one example of any direct 
                      communications.  
               3.49  Barclays confirmed in it 2014 Annual Report that it would be launching an 
                      external audit tender in 2015. Barclays prepared a briefing note for major 
                      shareholders covering the timetable and selection process and confirming that 
                      the Chairman of the Audit Tender Oversight Sub-Committee would be happy 
                      to discuss further with stakeholders. The tender document including the 
                      evaluation criteria was published on Barclays’ website.  
               3.50  Since 2013 external auditors have been required to prepare Extended 
                      Auditor’s Reports including information of their assessed risks of material 
                      misstatement, materiality and the scope of their audit. The intention was to 
                      enhance the level of investor confidence in audit, by providing greater insight 
                      and understanding the work of auditors. While investors have welcomed the

                      information included in these reports, many feel that more could be done. In 
                      particular, investors would like greater transparency assumptions made by 
                      management and the benchmarks used by auditors in making key 
                                   132
                      judgements.      
               3.51  Shareholders are aware that most of this information is of a confidential 
                      nature and cannot be made public. However, they argue that a mechanism 
                      should be created for allowing shareholders to have a better sense of how 
                      aggressive the accounting has been.  
               3.52  KPMG told us about its ‘graduated audit’ product, developed to address 
                      perceived institutional investor needs, and applied initially on a number of 
                      audits including Rolls-Royce where shareholder criticism of a lack of clarity 
                      made acceptance by the Audit Committee easier. The product provided 
                      greater disclosure and transparency for stakeholders. KPMG had tried to 
                      promote wider interest in the product with investors and Audit Committees, 
                      but had ‘not gained traction’. KPMG said that, while generally positively 
                      received, there was some nervousness on the part of Audit Committees 
                      around market perceptions. 
               3.53  Some investors recognised the limited capacity or willingness to engage. The 
                      active management industry is fragmented and does not always have the in-
                      house capacity for handling engagement with non-executive directors. It was 
                      suggested that this issue could be addressed through the FRC’s review and 
                      potential strengthening of the Stewardship Code. 
               3.54  While we must be realistic about the ability and incentives for investors to be 
                      more engaged, we have received submissions from a range of investors on 
                      the case for greater transparency. More disclosure could make it easier for 
                      investors to engage.  
               3.55  The better informed and more involved they are in the auditor appointment 
                      and conduct of the audit, the more confident we, and they, can be that audits 
                      are being carried out with the interests of investors in mind. Greater disclosure 
                      should have the further benefit of providing greater visibility on the 
                      effectiveness of Audit Committees in representing the interests of investors.

       Shareholder interest vs wider public interest 
       3.56  A final issue we have considered is whether, even if audit services were 
          delivered in the interests of company shareholders, this might still not be in 
          line with wider interests. This might be the case for example if:  
          (a)  Shareholder incentives are not aligned with the interests of employees, 
            customers and the general public. Within this we have considered 
            whether there might be particular issues in relation to the audit of private 
            companies.  
          (b)  There are wider externalities arising from robust audit which are not 
            internalised by shareholders.  
       3.57  The interests of existing shareholders may not always be fully aligned with 
          those of suppliers, employees, customers and pension holders. However, the 
          relevant question in relation to audit is whether their interests are aligned in 
          the publication of financial statements and accounts in which they can have 
          trust and confidence.  
       3.58  For listed companies, reliable financial reporting is essential to the 
          shareholder ability to hold management to account and to make informed 
          investment decisions.  
       3.59  In the case of private companies, however, ownership is sometimes more 
          concentrated and less remote from management. This means that owners 
          may be less reliant on independently verified published accounts for 
          information on management performance. It is, therefore, more plausible that 
          a company’s owners could have an incentive to influence auditors to the 
          detriment of wider stakeholders with an interest in the company.  
       3.60  The impact of corporate failures on the members of corporate pension 
          schemes has been a particular focus of public concern. For example, when 
          BHS failed there was a deficit in its pension scheme of £571m. As early as 
          2016 there was estimated to be a £900m deficit in Carillion’s pension 
          obligations and yet it made lower contributions to the pension schemes than 
          recommended by the Pension Trustee, its advisors and the Pension 
          Regulator. 
       3.61  This potential for divergence between the interests of shareholders in audit 
          and the interests of a company’s pension holders and the wider public 
          suggests that, even if the all of the principal-agent issues in relation to the role 
          of audit committees were addressed, concerns might remain. This points to a 
          continuing need for regulation to protect these wider public interests.  
                           55 
                                                 
       Competition and choice in the audit market 
       3.62  Competition can play a crucial role in driving higher quality only if the 
          incentives in the market are structured in the right way so that firms compete 
          on what matters to shareholders and wider stakeholders – i.e. high-quality 
          audit. Given the difficulty in observing audit quality, regulation plays a key role 
          alongside competition. Regulation is important in setting and maintaining 
          minimum standards for audit. Competition, in turn, if focused on matters 
          important to investors, can sharpen the incentives for auditors to deliver to a 
          consistently high standard.  
       3.63  Choice is a prerequisite for effective competition. All things being equal, the 
          more choice that Audit Committees have in selecting their auditor, the 
          stronger competition will be. In turn we would expect this to drive better 
          market outcomes under the right regulatory framework.  
       3.64  In some respects, competition appears to be working well following the 
          previous reforms to the market. Tenders occur much more frequently than in 
          the past. In most cases tenders involve detailed and comprehensive 
          processes that should allow the company to make well-informed decisions. 
          Although there are costs of tendering and switching, the switching process 
          has generally gone smoothly.  
       3.65  The majority of companies believe they have sufficient choice. However, for a 
          substantial minority of FTSE 350 companies, Audit Committees are faced with 
          fewer than three credible bidders for an audit tender. Competition is, in these 
          circumstances, fragile. If one of the bidders fails to impress, the company is 
          left, in effect, with no choice at all. The main drivers of lack of choice in these 
          cases appear to be:  
          (a)  Mandatory switching rules, which mean that the incumbent bidder cannot 
            participate (so the Big Four becomes the big three). 
          (b)  Lack of confidence that the challenger firms would have the capability to 
            carry out a complex audit including perceptions that the international 
            networks of the challenger firms do not have the same reach, strength 
            and consistency as those of the Big Four firms.  
          (c)  Conflicts with provision of non-audit services. In many cases auditors are 
            willing to drop non-audit work in order to take on an audit client and the 
            Audit Committees manage the process to allow time for the incoming 
            auditor to become ‘clean’. However, there are some cases where the 
            company views a particular piece of non-audit work as particularly 
            important and so does not want the firm in question to tender for the audit; 
                           56 
                                                                                                           
                           or where a tender has to be arranged quickly, for example where the 
                           company has concerns about its current auditor. In addition, for some 
                           companies and in some sectors, companies not wanting to have the same 
                           external auditor as their near competitors also reduces choice.  
                      (d)  There are also some cases where an auditor chooses not to participate. 
                           This can be for a variety of reasons including: not wanting to have too 
                           many clients in a particular sector; not wanting to exit significant non-audit 
                           work for the client; and an expectation that there is a low probability of 
                           winning. 
               3.66  Of these factors, the second and third are generally more significant at the top 
                      end of the market and in specific sectors. However, the last factor can also 
                      apply lower down the FTSE 350. 
               Evidence on competition as a driver of audit quality  
               3.67  There is some debate about the importance of choice and competition in 
                      driving audit quality. Some have raised legitimate concerns that competition 
                      might drive worse outcomes if it encourages too great a focus on cutting costs 
                      and too little focus on quality. Academic research evidence on the link 
                                                                                                      133
                      between competition and audit quality is relatively limited and inconclusive.       
               3.68  The importance of the interaction of competition and regulation was generally 
                      echoed by stakeholders we spoke to. For example, a number of parties 
                      recognised a role for both competition and regulation in driving audit quality. 
                      One challenger firm submitted that ‘[e]ffective competition and proportionate 
                                                                                            134
                      regulation combined are key to delivering better audit outcomes’.        
               3.69  Given the parallel independent review of the FRC led by Sir John Kingman, 
                      we have not looked in detail at the regulatory framework and have instead 
                      focused on whether choice and competition are working effectively. However,

                      in analysing the sector, we are conscious of the need for competition and 
                      regulation to complement one another. 
               Opportunities to compete: the audit tender process 
               3.70  Competition in the audit market takes the form of periodic competition through 
                      tenders for audit engagements. Effective competition requires that audits are 
                      tendered sufficiently frequently to allow opportunities for competitors to bid for 
                      contracts, and that companies have a genuine choice of alternative auditors 
                      when they carry out a tender.  
               3.71  At the time of the CC market investigation the primary concern was infrequent 
                                                         135
                      tenders and low switching rates.      Now all PIEs must tender their audit at 
                      least every ten years and to switch auditor at least every 20 years. Rates of 
                      tendering and switching have now increased dramatically. Over 50% of 
                      companies in the FTSE 350 have tendered their audit since January 2013 and 
                                                                                                          
                      the overall annual switching rate for FTSE 350 audits peaked at 14% in 2015. 
               3.72  The documentary evidence we gathered from companies and auditors 
                      suggests that tenders usually involve detailed and comprehensive selection 
                      processes. A typical tender process, from Request for Proposal (RFP) to 
                      decision, takes around three months but pre-preparation time may be several 
                      months or years. Conflict checks will typically take place at an early stage in 
                      the process, as well as at later stages. There may be a ‘pre-selection’ of the 
                      audit partners, where firms put forward two or three partners for the Audit 
                      Committee to choose who should lead the tender process. Data rooms are 
                      widely used in the tender process and access provided to management, 
                      enabling firms to gain an understanding of the business. ‘Technical’ 
                                                                           136
                      challenges are widely used in the tender process.         
               3.73  There are risks and costs associated with switching for both auditors and 
                      companies. To date, we heard that most of these costs appear to have been 
                      largely absorbed by the audit firms. This may have contributed to some of the 
                      lack of choice, as discussed further below. However, from a company 
                      perspective the experience of switching is generally judged to have been 
                      good and in line with the ACC’s expectations.  
               3.74  For example, an ACC noted the benefits of having a ‘fresh pair of eyes’ and 
                      new insight and challenge from the new auditor. We did come across some 
                
                
               135
                  For example, the CC found that the tenure of current auditor was more than ten years for 67 per cent of FTSE 
               100 companies and 52 per cent of FTSE 250 companies. 
               136
                  For example, it has become normal to test a firm’s technology, including its data analysis capabilities. See 
               PwC response to the ITC, Annex.

                      exceptions – for example, [].However, the majority of companies appear to 
                      believe they have benefited from the switching process.  
               Extent of choice in recent audit tenders 
               3.75  For competition for audit engagements to be effective in driving quality, there 
                      must be some degree of choice open to audit committees. Our evidence 
                      suggests that, for most FTSE 350 audit tenders, the audit committees were 
                                                        137
                      content with the level of choice.     However, for a substantial minority choice 
                      was limited. 
               3.76  We have been told that a choice between three bidders is generally sufficient 
                      to ensure a competitive tender. For example, [] said that ‘a maximum of 
                      three firms was in line with [its] desire to execute a streamlined, efficient 
                      tender process without impacting choice or quality’. One FTSE 100 ACC 
                      noted that ‘companies needed two bidders to provide valid choice in a tender 
                      process and that three bidders would be quite sufficient to provide valid 
                      choice in a tender process’. However, more generally, ACCs have expressed 
                      concern where choice is limited to two credible bidders.  
                                            138
               3.77  The FRC guidelines         state that a typical tender process should involve three 
                      or four audit firms. The legal requirement is that at least two firms are 
                      presented to the full board by the Audit Committee, with a justified preference 
                                   139
                      for one firm.    
               3.78  Most companies we spoke to that had recently tendered their audit said they 
                      felt that they had sufficient choice of auditor. However, for five of the 24 FTSE 
                      350 companies that were asked to provide information on their recent tender, 
                      choice appears to have been limited to two firms.  
                      (a)  [] was limited to a choice between two firms ([] and []). Challenger 
                           firms were not considered to have the capability or ‘global footprint’. 
                           Independence considerations meant that [] was precluded from inviting 
                                          140
                           [] to tender     and [] had decided that it wanted to switch from 
                                141
                           [].    However, the audit committee felt ‘that [] and [] both provided 
                           compelling propositions that demonstrate very strong capability’. 
                
                
               137
                  Based on responses provided by the sample of 24 FTSE 350 companies and from meetings with ACCs.

                       (b)  [] invited five firms to submit proposals ([] – [] was the 
                                         142
                            incumbent).     Only two submitted proposals ([]). The other three 
                            declined to submit proposals (none of them had existing non-audit 
                                                                                                 143
                            services relationship with []). While happy with the outcome,          [] 
                            would have liked all five firms to bid.  
                       (c)  [] invited five firms ([]) to tender. [] was the incumbent. Three firms 
                            declined to tender due to ‘being unable to confirm their independence 
                            under the new EU directive on audit independence’. An internal document 
                            suggest that [] was content with the choice it had: ‘the decision was 
                            finely balanced but gave particular weight to the quality of the lead partner 
                            from [], the benefits of being a [] and their ability to deploy a “fresh 
                            pair of eyes” on the sector’. 
                       (d)  In the case of [], [] as incumbent could not be reappointed. [] 
                            declined due to conflicts of interest including the expected need to stop 
                            acting as auditor of a number of pension schemes where [] group 
                            entities act as investment manager. The Audit Committee considered that 
                            it had sufficient choice, but would have preferred to have received a full 
                            tender response from the three firms invited to tender. 
                       (e)  Similarly, in the case of [], [] as the incumbent could not be 
                            reappointed. [] was excluded from the process [] and potential 
                            conflicts of interest. Five firms were invited ([]). [] said that it had 
                            limited choice as: [] had declined to bid due to the cost of bidding and 
                            lack of capacity to deliver. [] declined to bid as winning [] would 
                            further increase its exposure to []. [] was also concerned about []’s 
                            capacity []. [] has effectively been left dealing with [].  
                3.79  Around 30% of the FTSE 350 tenders in our sample of 247 tenders had fewer

                       than three competing bidders.        This is consistent with analysis submitted by

                       KPMG.  
                Factors limiting choice 
                3.80  Looking across the evidence provided by companies and auditors, we 
                       identified four main reasons for lack of choice in some tenders: mandatory 
                 
                 
                142
                   [] had been []([]). Suggests that [] could not participate given rotation requirements.    
                143
                   Internal document states [] will bring ‘smooth transition, ‘efficiency’, ‘robust and a challenging audit’, 
                ‘experienced and stable audit team, ‘Clear communication to management and the audit committee’ and ‘15% 
                saving on current audit fee’. We were told that [] had met expectations.  
                144
                   We consider this to be an upper bound as we are aware of occasions in our dataset where an auditor has not 
                included a tender in its submission when it did in fact participate in that tender. CMA analysis of auditors’ tender 
                data

                                                             60 
                                                                                                           
                      rotation rules; concerns about capability of firms outside the Big Four; conflicts 
                      rules; and choices by the audit firms not to bid.  
               Mandatory rotation 
               3.81  The first driver of lack of choice is a straightforward consequence of the EU 
                      rules on mandatory rotation. PIEs must tender their audit at least every ten 
                      years and rotate their auditor at least every 20 years. Where auditors have 
                      reached the point where they are required to switch, they cannot take part in 
                      the tender process. For those FTSE 350 companies that perceive that only 
                      one of the Big Four could perform their audit, the best-case scenario is that 
                      they will receive tenders from the remaining ‘big three’.  
               3.82  Based on tender data provided by three of the Big Four, of those cases where 
                      they chose not to bid, around 40% were explained by the mandatory rotation 
                            146
                      rules.    These three Big Four auditors identified a total of 78 tenders between 
                                                                                  147, 148
                      them that were affected by the mandatory rotation rules.            
               3.83  This evidence was confirmed by the information provided by companies. 
                      Several ACCs identified mandatory rotation rules as a key reason for limited 
                      choice.  
               Lack of presence of challenger firms in tenders 
               3.84  A second driver is a perceived lack of capability of auditors outside the Big 
                      Four to carry out audits of FTSE 350 companies, and in some cases the 
                      reluctance of challenger firms to take part in tenders even when invited.  
               3.85  Based on data provided by the auditors, we estimate that one or more 
                      challenger firms were approached to participate in around 30% of tenders for 
                      FTSE 350 audits between 2013 and 2018. However, a challenger firm 
                                                                                        149
                      submitted a proposal in fewer than 20% of FTSE 350 tenders.           
               3.86  Of the 24 FTSE 350 companies to whom we sent information requests, only 
                      four sent non-Big Four firms formal ‘Requests for a Proposal’. Out of the 24 
                      tenders: 
                
                
               146

               of auditors’ tender data. 
               147
                  We were unable to include the results for the other Big Four auditor because of concerns about reliability of 
               the data.  
               148
                  If anything this is likely to be an underestimate as audit firms were not in all cases able to confirm all the 
               historical tenders in which they did not bid.

                       (b)  []. 
                3.87  []. We analyse the barriers faced by challenger firms in more detail in the 
                       following section.  
                3.88  The reasons given by companies as to why challenger firms were eliminated 
                       at an early stage included lack of sufficient scale, international presence and 
                       experience with large companies, and lower perceived quality. One company 
                       noted that its contribution to a challenger firm total fee income would have 
                       been significant, potentially impacting independence.  
                Conflicts issues 
                3.89  Third, the multi-disciplinary nature of the large audit firms, combined with 
                       regulations to prevent conflicts between audit and non-audit work, can lead to 
                       a significant reduction in choice in some cases.  
                3.90  Under the EU rules, the auditor carrying out the statutory audit of a PIE is not 
                       allowed to provide certain prohibited non-audit services including tax and 
                       valuation services. Permitted non-audit services are subject to a 70% cap of 
                       the average audit fee over the last three financial years. This means that, 
                       where an audit firm is providing a significant amount of non-audit work for a 
                       client, there needs to be a process of ‘cleaning’ the conflicts before the firm 
                       can be appointed as the auditor.  
                                                               150 
                3.91  Several ACCs, including Go Ahead,           Pension Insurance Corporation and 
                            151                     152
                       [],    and Thomas Cook          all identified the rules around conflicts of 
                       interest/independence as creating a restriction on choice.  
                3.92  We were told that companies and audit firms can often take steps to manage 
                       conflicts of interest. In advance of the tender, a company will have 
                       discussions with potential bidders. This is an opportunity to identify potential 
                       conflicts of interests and for these be addressed. For example, []. 
                3.93  However, the process of managing client conflicts can be complex, 
                       particularly as the rules apply to provision of non-audit services by any firm in 
                       the international network to the company or parent companies. In most cases 
                       the main constraint appears to come from the restricted services (where 
                 
                 
                150
                   Two firms decided to withdraw from the process due to conflicts of interest in the provision of related services 
                to the Go-Ahead Group plc and its subsidiaries. 
                151

                152
                   Deloitte was conflicted as they offered tax advisory to Thomas Cook already. 
                                                              62 
                                                                                                            
                      auditors need to demonstrate independence) rather than the broader cap of 
                      70% on permitted non-audit work.  
               3.94  We also heard that companies sometimes did not want to retender non-audit 
                      work, particularly where one of the Big Four had a particular specialism and 
                      was providing ongoing advice. For example, [] told us that [] was 
                      providing it with advice on [] over a number of years, and that it was not 
                      feasible to switch to an alternative provider. This meant that it did not invite 
                      [] to tender for the audit contract. We heard several other similar examples 
                      from other ACCs.  
               Decisions by auditors not to bid for contracts 
               3.95  Finally, we found that in a number of cases auditors chose not to bid for audit 
                      contracts. In many cases these reasons related to the conflicts between audit 
                      and non-audit services outlined in the previous section.  
               3.96  We received information from the Big Four and three challenger firms on a 
                      total of 151 instances where an auditor was approached, formally or 
                                                                                              153
                      informally, to a tender, but did not submit a formal tender proposal.       The 
                      reasons cited by these auditors for not submitting a formal tender proposal (ie 
                      not participating) varied considerably and in most cases it was not clear if the 
                      auditor had rejected the invitation or if the auditor did not make the final tender 
                      shortlist. 
               3.97  The information from the Big Four is consistent with conflicts of interest 
                      restricting choice to some extent. In particular, the most common reason cited 
                      by the Big Four for not participating when invited was the provision of non-
                                                                  154
                      audit services (roughly 57% of the time).       All other reasons were only cited 
                      by the Big Four in relation to 10% or less of tenders and included the auditor 
                      considering it had a low likelihood of success and other actual or perceived 
                                                                              155
                      independence conflicts (eg banking arrangements).           
               3.98  Despite non-audit services being the most common reason cited by the Big 
                      Four for not participating when invited, the Big Four still appeared to 
                      participate in most tenders where the tendering company was a non-audit 
                      services client. In particular, our data set suggests that the Big Four 
                
                
               153
                  That is, these instances are where the auditor was both invited, informally or formally, to tender and provided 
               a reason why it did not submit a tender proposal. CMA analysis of auditors’ tender data. 
               154
                  Information received from the Big Four showed that, when including those they were not invited to, the most 
               important reason cited for why they did not participate in a tender was due to rotation requirements. See 
               paragraph [3.82].

                                                            63 
                                                                                                              
                       participated in on average 80% of the tenders they were aware of where the 
                                                                               156
                       tendering company was a non-audit services client.          
               3.99  However, EY told us that a factor in considering whether to participate would 
                       be maintaining a balanced audit business. It would want to avoid being overly 
                       exposed to problems that might emerge in a certain sector. Related to this, in 
                       the banking sector, the prudential regulator would be unlikely to want one 
                       auditor to dominate the audit of retail banking. 
               3.100 In contrast to the Big Four, the three challenger firms only cited the provision 
                       of non-audit services in a handful of cases. Rather, at least one challenger 
                       firm told us that in many cases they did not make the final tender shortlist for 
                       some unspecified reason. Other reasons cited, both for rejecting an invitation 
                       and not making the final shortlist, included having a lack of credentials or 
                       sector expertise and a lack of a relationship with the tendering company.  
               3.101 In addition, one of the challenger firms (Grant Thornton) told us that it did not 
                       participate in some tenders because it had decided not to bid for the audits of 
                                               157
                       FTSE 350 companies.         It told us that the drivers of this decision were the 
                       time and costs associated with the tender processes combined with a bias in 
                       favour of the Big Four. In the absence of market reform, the commercial 
                       opportunities for Grant Thornton were in advisory services and in developing 
                       its audit practice in companies outside the FTSE350 and in the public sector. 
                       If the market conditions change, Grant Thornton said that it would consider 
                       again tendering for FTSE 350 audits.  
               3.102 BDO told us that it had, in recent years, declined some approaches to tender 
                       for FTSE 350 audits. BDO tended to focus on clients in certain sectors. In 
                       addition, a decision on whether to submit a proposal would be based on a 
                       number of factors including: the other firms likely to be invited to tender and 
                       their relationships with the company and Audit Committee members; potential 
                       conflicts; and BDO’s previous working relationship with the company. 
               Barriers to expansion facing challenger firms 
               3.103 As identified in the previous section, one of the main constraints on choice 
                       and competition in the market for FTSE 350 audits is the difficulty faced by 
                       firms outside the Big Four in expanding their position. Challenger firms 
                       continue to have a very limited presence in the FTSE 350. They had only nine 
                       FTSE 350 audit clients and around 1% share of FTSE 350 audit fees in 2017

                                                             64 
                                                 
          (as set out previously), despite more frequent tendering and switching of audit 
          contracts.  
       3.104 There appear to be both demand-side and supply-side barriers that are 
          preventing challenger firms from building on their presence in the FTSE 350 
          market. These barriers reinforce each other, creating a vicious circle from 
          which it is very difficult for the firms to escape. 
       3.105 On the demand side, there are genuine concerns about the capability of 
          challenger firms to carry out the most complex audits, particularly those 
          requiring large international teams. However, we also found that the 
          challenger firms faced a ‘chicken and egg’ problem – they were frequently 
          ruled out of tenders on the basis of lack of experience, but would only be able 
          to build that experience by gaining a more substantial foothold in the market. 
          We also saw evidence of a reluctance on the part of some investors to 
          support Audit Committees who recommended hiring an auditor from outside 
          the Big Four.  
       3.106 On the supply side, challenger firms appear reluctant in general to bid for 
          FTSE350 audits. Given current market conditions, this appears to be a 
          rational reaction to the cost of tendering, likelihood of winning, and risk for a 
          smaller firm of taking on a large audit client. Breaking out of this cycle is likely 
          to take significant action to reset the market.  
       Demand-side constraints 
       3.107 On the demand side, we found a mix of concerns raised by ACCs and 
          investors. Some of these related to the capability of the challenger firms, but 
          others related more to a perception of risk in taking on a firm outside the Big 
          Four.  
       Capability of the challenger firms 
       3.108 It appears to be widely accepted that challenger firms do not currently have 
          the capability to audit the largest, most complex companies at the top end of 
          the FTSE 350. This is in part because of the size of the audit teams required 
          to carry out these audits and, in some cases, because the challenger firms do 
          not have the required sector or other expertise. 
       3.109 This does not, however, explain why challenger firms have not been 
          successful in establishing a presence in the smaller end of the market (e.g. in 
          the FTSE 250). There is evidence that when challenger firms are given 
          serious consideration and the opportunity to demonstrate their capability, they 
          can win (for example the recent JD Wetherspoons and Mitie tenders). Grant 
                           65 
                                                                                                                 
                        Thornton said that ‘Mid-tier firms do possess the requisite capacity and quality 
                        to deliver quality audit services to all but the largest companies’. 
                3.110 Even for the smaller and less complex companies in the FTSE350, several 
                        ACCs argued that the capability of the challenger firms was substantially 
                        below that of the Big Four in a number of ways. Respondents frequently cited:  
                        (a)  Challenger firms’ smaller international networks;  
                        (b)  lack of capacity of the challenger firms to put together a team of sufficient 
                            scale for a complex audit;  
                        (c)  concerns about quality of the challenger firms (for example as suggested 
                            through perceived lower AQR scores in some cases, and comparatively 
                            lower investment in technology and systems compared with the Big Four); 
                            and 
                        (d)  lack of experience of auditing similar firms; and/or lack of experience 
                            gained through providing non-audit services to the client.  
                3.111 For example, having considered the Group’s needs and the experience of 
                        audit firms in leading and coordinating global audits, the directors of RELX 
                        Group concluded that ‘It is unlikely that a firm outside the Big 3 could provide 
                                                                                  158
                        an integrated audit with suitable quality assurance’.        [] told us that it 
                        excluded ‘[] due to size, capability and also their responsiveness to some of 
                        the work undertaken on the group’s smaller audits this year’. Mondi concluded 
                        that Grant Thornton and BDO, while having the international coverage, had at 
                        the time of the tender process in 2015 ‘limited FTSE100 coverage, with only 1 
                        client each and much weaker AQRT scores’. Mondi also said that its 
                        ‘contribution to total fee income would be significant, potentially impacting 
                        independence’. 
                3.112 There is also some academic literature suggesting that smaller audit firms 
                        may be expected to provide, on average, lower quality audits. This may be 
                        because larger firms have more reputational capital to protect, higher litigation 
                        risk and greater regulatory scrutiny; are less financially dependent on any 
                        given client, which reduces their incentives to compromise their 
                        independence; and are able to attract and retain higher-quality human 
                        resources and expertise, therefore increasing their competence. Empirical

                   In order to meet the requirements of RELX Group’s listing in the Netherlands, the incumbent audit firm, 
                Deloitte, could not be invited to tender. 
                 
                                                               66 
                                                                                                                 
                        evidence from recent studies (based on US data) supports this argument, 
                                                                                                          159
                        although it is unclear how far these findings might read across to the UK.            
                Perceptions and risk of taking on a challenger firm 
                3.113 Aside from the objective capabilities of the challenger firms, some have 
                        claimed that firms outside the Big Four face a perception bias. For example, 
                        we heard that Audit Committees may have an incentive to hire the Big Four 
                        because they risk criticism for hiring one of the challenger firms if things go 
                        wrong.  
                3.114 The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators told us that the 
                        attitudes of the large corporates’ shareholders and regulators ‘inevitably play 
                        a part in this reluctance’ to switch to challenger firms and there is ‘much truth’ 
                                                                                           160
                        in the proposition that ‘no-one was ever fired for hiring IBM’.        A former audit 
                        partner at Grant Thornton and KPMG said that Audit Committees see 
                        appointing a non-Big Four a risk and ‘[t]he often mentioned expression of ‘who 
                        ever got blamed for selecting IBM’ still prevails in the selection of audit 
                              161
                        firms’.   
                3.115 We did not see strong evidence in the tender selection processes of this ‘IBM 
                        effect’. However, we found that there is a lack of objective information 
                        available to Audit Committees to validate their judgements on quality of the 
                        challenger firms, which makes it hard for them to justify appointing a 
                        challenger firm. This suggests that the challenger firms face a significant 
                        ‘chicken and egg’ problem – they need audit experience in order to prove their 
                        capability, but without existing experience they cannot win significant audit 
                        contracts in the first place.  
                3.116 The challenger firms highlighted these perception problems in their responses 
                        to us. For example, BDO said that ‘audit committees are appropriately diligent 
                        and seek to fulfil their duties conscientiously. However an audit is a “credence 
                        good” where quality is difficult to measure and as such false proxies are used 
                        such as the size of the audit firm or a firm's current roster of clients in the 
                 
                 
                159
                   These studies show that, compared to non-Big Four auditors, Big Four auditors are significantly more likely to 
                issue going concern opinions to distressed clients and are less prone to false positive and false negative errors; 
                this is indicative both of greater independence and greater competency. Accounts audited by Big Four auditors 
                also show lower levels of discretionary accruals (a widely used measure of ‘earnings management’). See (i)

                      sector. The correlation of these factors to audit quality is weak. We believe 
                      these false proxies explain why challenger firms with better records on audit 
                      quality are consistently being unsuccessful in tenders and becoming 
                      frustrated that they are there simply to make up the numbers rather than be a

                      real contender’.     
               3.117 Grant Thornton said that, on the demand-side, Big Four firms are seen as ‘a 
                      safe option’ and that ‘Audit committees have little incentive to make anything 
                      other than a conservative choice’. Also, that there is ‘a bias towards Big 4 
                      firms as a result of the professional background of audit committee and 
                      management alumni, incumbent relationships with Big 4 firms, or familiarity 
                                        163
                      with the brands’.     
               3.118 Moore Stephens said that there has ‘not been a desire by companies to select 
                      non-big four firms, even when they are equally able and qualified’ and that 
                      Audit Committees could not be blamed for choosing a Big Four firm ‘even 
                                                      164
                      were something to go wrong.’         
               3.119 RSM said that there is a ‘deep-rooted resistance by UK listed companies to 
                      appointing a non-Big 4 firm as their auditor. The Big 4 firms enjoy a number of 
                      advantages of scale, size, familiarity, and a marked level of subliminal bias 
                      that act in their favour’. RSM also said that because of ‘their large consulting 
                      and other non-audit activities, the dominant firms are known by, and have 
                      worked with, far more companies listed on the main market than challenger 
                      firms’. In addition, ‘their alumni are in leading positions across the business 
                      and financial communities, further strengthening their brand recognition and 
                                      165
                      endorsement’.       
               3.120 This view about Big Four alumni appears to be supported by a recent survey 
                                                   166
                      in Accountancy magazine,         which found that 64% of FTSE100 ACCs had 
                      previously worked for a Big Four firm. The presence of ex-Big Four 
                      employees on Audit Committees is perhaps unsurprising given that the Big 
                      Four do employ a disproportionate share of financial professionals and 
                      therefore it is to be expected that senior staff are more likely to have links to 
                      Big Four firms than challenger ones. However, it raises questions about 
                      whether Audit Committee members’ greater familiarity with the Big Four might 
                      lead them to favour Big Four firms when assessing audit tenders.

               3.121 We also saw some evidence that the perception challenge facing the 
                       challenger firms extends to investors as well as Audit Committees. For 
                       example, we were told of at least one example where a challenger firm was 
                       chosen as the preferred bidder by the Audit Committee but then rejected 
                       following intervention by investors ([] audit).  
               3.122 Also, while JD Wetherspoons appointed Grant Thornton, the ACC advised the 
                       board that ‘if the decision to award the contract to Grant Thornton is ratified, 
                       the advice from [] is for the Chairman of the Audit Committee to write to our 
                       top 10 shareholders explaining the decision to move from PwC to Grant 
                       Thornton. This would be a proactive measure to head off questions that could 
                                                                                           
                       possibly arise with this move from a ‘top-tier’ to ‘mid-tier’ firm’.JD 
                       Wetherspoons told us that no response was received from any of the 
                       shareholders written to after the Grant Thornton appointment.  
               Supply-side barriers 
               3.123 On the supply side, the barriers for challenger firms include: high tender costs; 
                       an emphasis during tender processes upon experience in auditing FTSE 350 
                       companies; greater regulatory, financial and reputational risk involved in 
                       conducting audits for FTSE 350 companies; and the risk that, in securing 
                       audit work, conflicts of interest will bar a firm from securing more lucrative 
                       advisory work. 
               3.124 There are undoubtedly significant costs involved in scaling up an audit 
                       business to take on more complex audit clients. Mazars told us that ‘it is 
                       unduly hard for challenger firms to recruit audit partners from Big 4 firms’. And 
                       several of the challenger firms mentioned the cost of investing in IT systems 
                       to carry out complex audit processes, although they noted that they were 
                                                                    167
                       indeed willing to carry out this investment.     
               3.125 However, challenger firms are currently reluctant even to compete for every 
                       tender where they are given the opportunity – some more than others. For 
                       example, Grant Thornton said in March 2018 that it only audits a small 
                       number of clients in the FTSE 350 and that ‘it continues to be extremely 
                       difficult to penetrate this market’. As a result, Grant Thornton had ‘taken the 
                       strategic decision to move away from tendering for statutory audit work in the 
                                   168
                       FTSE 350’.      While other challenger firms are continuing to compete for 
                       some FTSE350 audits, our view is that the general reluctance to bid is a 
                
                
               167

                      rational response to their perception of the return on investment they can 
                      expect.  
               3.126 As noted above, the challenger firms are invited to fewer tenders than the Big 
                      Four. Among these invitations, they choose to bid on a smaller proportion of 
                      occasions and have a lower success rate than the Big Four (around 20% 
                                                                                                       169
                      success rate for the challenger firms vs. 35% for the Big Four on average).          
                      Given that bidding seriously for large audits is universally recognised as 
                      expensive and time-consuming, it is not surprising that the challenger firms 
                      think twice about participating in FTSE 350 tenders.  
               3.127 A further common concern raised by the challenger firms is of not wanting to 
                      take on too much risk by having a single audit client making up a large share 
                      of the auditor’s total audit revenues.  
               3.128 Finally, several firms outside of the Big Four raised concerns about the 
                      regulatory costs and risks of competing for larger audits. This appears to be a 
                      particular concern for smaller firms that might be considering starting to bid for 
                      PIE audits. But it also seems keenly felt by Grant Thornton following recent 
                      fines. For recent cases, the fines resulting from enforcement action were, for 
                      the Big Four firms, in the range of 0.4% - 1.2% of UK firm audit fees in the 
                      relevant year. The 1.2% figure is the £10 million fine, discounted to £6.5 
                      million, for BHS audit failures. Grant Thornton has been fined twice for 
                      infringements of independence rules. There was no suggestion of any audit 
                      failure and yet the fines amounted to 1.8% and 2.5% of its UK firm audit fee 
                      revenues in the relevant year. 
               3.129 A number of challenger firms have suggested that FRC enforcement activity 
                      has raised the barriers to them competing for FTSE 350 audits. Crowe cites 
                      that one of the principal supply side barriers they have observed was the 
                      ‘additional risk and exposure to non-Big Four firms from being caught in 
                                                                    170
                      litigation and also regulatory enforcement’.      The inference from its argument 
                      is that, given their relative size and financial resources, there would be a 
                      disproportionate impact on smaller firms of the reputational damage and/or 
                      fines resulting from any enforcement action which are factors that may deter 
                      challenger firms from bidding for FTSE 350 audit engagements, given the 
                      opportunity. 
               3.130 Supply-side barriers are significant, but many of them relate strongly to the 
                      demand-side constraint. In other words, if the challenger firms had a higher

          to overcome the supply-side barriers.  
       Resilience 
       3.131 Given the already limited choice in the market, we would be very concerned 
          about the failure or withdrawal of one of the Big Four auditors if this led to the 
          creation of a more consolidated 'Big Three'. With the current rules around 
          conflicts and mandatory rotation, we would not see a market of three large 
          auditors as being sustainable in the long run and would expect audit quality to 
          suffer.  
       3.132 If one of the large audit firms failed, we would expect to be able to use 
          competition tools to some extent to mitigate the consolidation of the market, 
          including, subject to jurisdictional thresholds being met, merger review. 
          However, there are limits on how effective these powers are likely to be in 
          practice. It is also not clear that the challenger firms would have the capacity 
          to take on a large number of existing Big Four audits at short notice.  
       3.133 A further concern is that resilience issues might create an incentive for the 
          regulator not to take appropriate action against a large audit firm that was 
          performing poorly because of the fear that this might drive the firm out of 
          business. We have not found any evidence that this is currently affecting the 
          approach of the FRC. However, it is possible that these concerns might 
          increase in the future, for example if regulatory sanctions were strengthened 
          and if the challengers failed to grow their capability to carry out complex 
          audits.  
       Potential impact on choice of failure of a large audit firm 
       3.134 The first concern relating to resilience is that, if one of the Big Four auditors 
          were to fail, this would leave only three remaining large players. Given our 
          finding that there is already very limited choice for some FTSE 350 audits, the 
          loss of one of the four large auditors would clearly exacerbate these 
          problems. Some companies would have no or limited choice in the 
          appointment of their auditor, weakening competition, and we would expect 
          audit quality to suffer. 
       3.135 We have considered first how likely it is that an audit firm might fail, and, 
          second, whether, in the event of failure, regulators would be able to step in to 
          limit the degree of consolidation of the market.  
                           71 
                                                                                                               
                Resilience of the large audit firms  
                3.136 Recent experience suggests that the Big Four firms appear to be resilient. 
                       They have withstood the reputational harm caused by a number of high profile 
                       cases of audit failure in the UK and elsewhere.  
                3.137 There are a number of factors likely to be contributing to this including: the 
                       regulatory requirement for listed companies to appoint an external auditor; 
                       that choice for larger and more complex companies appears to be limited to 
                       the Big Four firms; the size of these firms and the support provided by their 
                       international networks; that clients cannot switch quickly; and the ability of 
                       firms to contain the reputational harm to individual teams and partners.  
                3.138 For example, Deloitte told us that, ‘[they] in common with the other four 
                       largest firms, are a partnership with significant revenues in the UK. Being part 
                       of such large and balanced businesses affords a number of benefits. It offers 
                                                                                                171
                       a high degree of resilience to allow weathering of adverse events’.           
                3.139 PwC told us that ‘there are a number of reasons that a firm might fail, 
                       including reputational damage arising from audit failures’, but that there is not 
                                                                                    172
                       ‘a significant risk that the audit market lacks resilience’.     It said that should a 
                       firm in part of a global network fail, a new network affiliate could re-enter the 
                       national market (as has happened with PwC in Japan). There would also be 
                       the potential for other firms (including challenger firms) to take on audits of the 
                       failed firm.  
                3.140 These features have so far allowed the Big Four firms to withstand 
                       reputational damage. That it can take time for companies to switch auditor 
                       (including the time taken to manage conflicts caused by non-audit work) gives 
                       both the firm and regulators time to address concerns and restore confidence. 
                       This is helped by the weight attached by clients to the reputation, experience 
                       and capability of individual partners and audit teams, which has allowed firms 
                       to ‘contain’ the harm caused by audit failures. While this all increases 
                       resilience, it might contribute negatively to audit quality because of the ‘moral 
                       hazard’ problem, discussed further at paragraph 2.150 below.  
                3.141 However, concerns remain about the ability of the market to manage more 
                       catastrophic failure (such as that seen with Arthur Andersen in the past). The 
                       risk may be small, but it cannot be dismissed as a possibility. This could be

                       triggered by audit failure(s) in the UK or another major firm in the global 
                       network.  
               Regulatory response to audit firm failure  
               3.142 The impact of failure of one of the large firms on competition would be 
                       mitigated if it were possible to prevent the failed firm’s audits from moving to 
                       the remaining three large auditors. For example, if the failed firm’s audits and 
                       partners could instead be moved to one of the challenger firms (or shared 
                       between a number of them) then the concerns about the impact on choice 
                       would be significantly diminished.  
               3.143 The existing insolvency regimes applicable to audit firms are not designed to 
                       protect choice or resilience, as discussed further in the remedies section at 
                       paragraph 4.105 onwards.  
               3.144 Whether or not the merger regime would ‘bite’ in case of assets moving from 
                       a failed or failing auditor to a competitor would depend on whether or not such 
                       a transaction would qualify for assessment by the CMA under the merger 
                                     173
                       control rules.     
               3.145 If a merger were to qualify under the jurisdictional thresholds, the CMA would 
                       proceed to a substantive assessment of whether it would result in a significant 
                       lessening of competition (SLC). Any decision of the CMA on whether or not 
                       the SLC test is met would be context-and fact-specific. 
               3.146 In practice our view is that the merger rules would provide only limited 
                       protection against consolidation during or following failure of one of the Big 
                       Four. Although a wholesale transfer of assets could fall within jurisdiction of 
                       the merger rules, it is possible, depending on the factual circumstances, that 
                       the merger rules may not apply. It is also unlikely that the challenger firms 
                       would currently have the capacity to absorb all of the clients of one of the four 
                       large auditors.  
               3.147 Therefore, we have provisionally concluded that failure of one of the large 
                       auditors would be very likely to materially worsen the current choice problems 
                       in the market and weaken competition.  
                
                
               173
                  The jurisdictional test for the CMA to be able to assess a relevant merger situation is threefold: first, two or 
               more enterprises (which broadly speaking would be business activities of any kind) have ceased to be distinct or 
               that arrangements to that effect are in progress or contemplation; second, that either the turnover or the share of 
               supply test would be met; and third that the merger either has not yet taken place (or has taken place less than 
               four months ago). The concept of ‘ceasing to be distinct’ provides that any two enterprises cease to be distinct if 
               they are brought under common ownership or common control; ‘control’ is not limited to the acquisition of outright 
               voting control but may include situations falling short of it.  See sections 23, 24, 26 and 33 of the Enterprise Act 
               2002. 
                                                             73 
                                                                                                                                                     
                     Evidence of the impact of lack of resilience on regulation 
                     3.148 The second, related concern is that fears about the impact of allowing one of 
                               the large audit firms to fail might prevent the regulator from taking appropriate 
                               action to address quality concerns. This in turn could lead to a ‘moral hazard’ 
                               problem, weakening the incentives for firms to focus on high quality audits. 
                               For example, in response to our invitation to comment document, one group 
                               of academics stated that despite regulators holding concerns about the 
                               market structure and the impact on choice, ‘the profession is likely to escape 
                               censure from either the government or regulators who fear that any 
                               crackdown will only force one or more of the firms out of business and make 
                                                              174
                               the situation worse’.              
                     3.149 While some commentators have referred to the Big Four as being ‘too big to 
                                     175
                               fail’,     it is important to recognise that the issues in the audit market are 
                               different from those in banking, for example. In banking, there is a concern 
                               about systemic contagion, with failure of one bank affecting the viability of 
                               other banks. In audit, these systemic risks appear smaller. Although the 
                               failure of one auditor might be expected to have a systemic impact on 
                               confidence in the wider sector, companies would still need to carry out 
                               statutory audits, and it appears unlikely that failure of an audit firm would 
                               significantly increase the costs of other auditors or reduce their profitability. 
                               Instead, the main reason why regulators might be reluctant to take strong 
                               action against an auditor would be if they were concerned about the impact on 
                               competition and choice.  
                     3.150 We looked at whether there was any evidence that the FRC is currently 
                               constrained by concerns about lack of resilience. We first considered the 
                               sanctions resulting from FRC enforcement action. At less than 0.5% of annual 
                               revenues of the UK firm, these have fallen well short of levels that could 
                               threaten the financial viability of firms, given our views on the overall 
                               resilience of the sector outlined above. This compares, for example, with fines 
                               of up to 10% of worldwide turnover in the case of breaches of competition law. 
                               There is, however, no suggestion that the FRC would have considered larger 
                               fines, but for concerns about the impact on the financial viability of the firms.  
                     3.151 More generally, the FRC told us that it did not see concerns about resilience 
                               as constraining its ability to take action. It noted that firm failure was more 
                               likely to be triggered by litigation or a more general loss of reputation or 
                               confidence, rather than directly as a result of regulatory action. This was

                        on this issue in their responses to the launch document.  
                3.152 However, the Independent Review of the FRC has been considering what 
                        regulatory and enforcement powers might be appropriate in the future. If the 
                        FRC’s powers are significantly strengthened, concerns about threatening the 
                        viability of the large auditors might be a more significant issue for the regulator 
                        in future.  
                Firms’ structure and the culture of multi-disciplinary firms 
                3.153 The final issue we have considered is whether the structure of the audit firms 
                        currently creates the right incentives to deliver high audit quality. In particular, 
                        we have sought to understand whether the very significant non-audit 
                        revenues earned by the auditors might influence the way in which they 
                        perform audits.  
                3.154 The core concern is that auditors might have weak incentives to challenge a 
                        company’s management or exercise scepticism about the company’s 
                                                                                                 176
                        accounts if they are also selling substantial non-audit services.           These 
                        conflicts might play out in two ways:  
                        (a)  At a client level – for example, if there is more opportunity to sell non-audit 
                             services to audit clients (or vice versa), and the auditor fears that 
                             challenging company management could result in the loss of non-audit 
                             work.  
                        (b)  At the level of the audit firm – for example if the culture and focus of the 
                             firm is more driven by growth opportunities in non-audit services, and this 
                             affects the incentives in the audit side of the business.  
                3.155 Overall, we found limited evidence of conflicts between audit and non-audit 
                        work at the client level, primarily because of the restrictions in place on cross-
                        selling. In many cases auditors now have to reduce their existing level of non-
                        audit work in order to take on audit clients because of the independence rules 
                        and desire to avoid any perception of conflict.  
                3.156 However, there remains a concern that the culture of the Big Four (and other 
                        smaller auditors) is driven by non-audit services, which make up the majority 
                        of their revenue and growth). 
                 
                 
                176
                   For example, Prof Prem Sikka et al. note that ‘Auditor independence is compromised by the sale of 
                consultancy services to audit clients and is a major factor in audit failures.’ Reforming the auditing industry,

                 Scale and growth of non-audit services carried out by the audit firms 
                 3.157 As set out above, both Big Four and challenger firms generate a majority of 
                         their revenue from non-audit services rather than audits (around 80% of total 
                         UK firm revenues are from non-audit services). Revenues from non-audit 
                         services have also increased faster than those from audit (over the period 
                         2011 to 2018 non-audit service revenues increased by 46% compared with 
                         30% for audit), and non-audit services have been consistently more profitable 
                         than audit (with EBIT margins in 2018 for non-audit services of around []% 
                         and for audit of around []%). 
                 3.158 We found that the bulk of these non-audit services are provided to companies 
                         that are not audit clients. The average value of non-audit services provided by 
                         the Big Four firms to their all audit clients has fallen from around 55% of audit 
                         fees in 2011 to 38% of audit fees in 2018.

                 Source: CMA calculations based on auditors’ responses 
                 Potential for conflicts at the client level 
                 3.160 The evidence above shows that the proportion of non-audit sales to audit 
                         clients has fallen in recent years. In large part this is due to CC and EU 
                         interventions to restrict the overall amount of non-audit services that can be 
                         provided and prohibit entirely certain types of services to audit clients.  
                 3.161 Using information provided by the Big Four firms, we estimated that, in 
                         2017/18, revenues earned from non-audit services provided to their FTSE 350 
                         audit clients were, on average, around 20% of their FTSE 350 audit fees. This 
                         figure varies between the Big Four firms. 
                 3.162 We heard that, in many cases, auditors who were successful in a tender had 
                         to exit or significantly scale back their existing non-audit work. We also found 
                         that in some cases auditors and Audit Committees were keen to go beyond 
                         the regulations to ensure that their auditor provided no non-audit services 
                         (aside from a narrow range of services that were considered to be directly 
                         related to the audit), in order to remove any perception of conflicts. This was 
                         particularly the case for the largest companies within the FTSE100. This 
                         suggests that revenues from non-audit services to audit clients could fall 
                         further in the coming years.  
                 3.163 The effect of these developments in the FTSE 350 market is likely to be to 
                         reduce the short-term incentives for auditors not to challenge company 
                         management for fear of losing non-audit work.  
                                                                   77 
                                                 
       3.164 However, in the longer term, FTSE 350 companies must rotate auditors at 
          least every 20 years. We would therefore expect all the Big Four firms to have 
          ongoing programmes for managing the anticipated loss of some FTSE 350 
          audit clients and the opportunities this creates in the provision of non-audit 
          services. When a company switches auditor, the previous auditor is freed up 
          to take on non-audit work. At the same time the new auditor may have to exit 
          from or scale down its non-audit work with the client. This cycle has the same 
          potential to weaken the incentives of the incumbent auditor to challenge a 
          company’s management or exercise scepticism if it knows that it will be in a 
          position to sell non-audit services in the future. The risk will clearly be lower 
          when a firm first acquires an FTSE 350 audit, when the audit term has longer 
          left to run (or at least expected to run). 
       ‘Cross subsidies’ between audit and non-audit work 
       3.165 A related set of concerns was raised with us about possible ‘cross-subsidies’ 
          between audit and non-audit work. The broad concern is that audit work might 
          be under-priced to act as a ‘loss leader’ in order to sell on more profitable 
          non-audit work, and that this might then weaken the incentive to perform a 
          high-quality audit.  
       3.166 The high-level profitability figures outlined previously offer some evidence that 
          margins on non-audit work are higher than those on audit work for the Big 
          Four auditors. This is also consistent with views we heard from the auditors 
          and other stakeholders. However, there is no suggestion that the audit 
          businesses are unprofitable at an aggregate level. It might also be expected 
          that returns from audit work (which typically provides firms with a relatively 
          low-risk revenue stream over several years) may be lower than for certain 
          types of non-audit services where there is greater revenue risk. Therefore, we 
          cannot draw any clear conclusions from the high-level profitability 
          assessment.  
       3.167 In terms of incentives on the auditors, for the reasons set out above, the rules 
          on conflicts and on the amount of non-audit work that can be provided to an 
          audit client significantly reduce any incentive that the auditors might have to 
          use audit as a loss leader at the client level. Where the Big Four win tenders 
          for large company audits, they frequently have to reduce rather than increase 
          their non-audit work to that client, so it is not clear why they would have an 
          incentive to ‘under-bid’.  
       3.168 The auditors told us that audit work has a significant wider reputational effect 
          on the firm, including its non-audit practices. In principle, this might create 
          some incentive to bid more aggressively for audit work as a platform from 
          which to sell non-audit work to different (non-audit) clients. However, it is not 
                           78 
                                                 
          clear why this would materially affect the incentives to carry out high quality 
          audit to audit clients where there are no, or limited, non-audit sales.  
       3.169 There might be a further concern if the Big Four auditors were able to use the 
          profits from their non-audit work to under-bid the challenger firms and so 
          make it more difficult for them to gain a foothold in the market. For the 
          reasons set out above, it is not clear why the Big Four would have an 
          incentive to behave in this way. Even if they did have an incentive to try to 
          under-bid the challenger firms, the challengers also have large non-audit 
          practices so could follow a similar pricing approach to the Big Four. In these 
          circumstances, it appears unlikely that the Big Four would have the ability and 
          incentive to under-bid in order to exclude competitors.  
       3.170 In order to test this further, we gathered some evidence on prices submitted 
          by different bidders in tenders. At this stage the evidence is incomplete, and 
          we are only able to put limited weight on it. However, the evidence so far does 
          not suggest that the Big Four are systemically under-bidding the other 
          challenger firms.  
       3.171 Finally, the auditors told us that one of the benefits of the multidisciplinary firm 
          structure was that non-audit advice on audit matters could be provided at 
          lower cost than would be the case if the audit firm had to contract for advice 
          from a separate non-audit firm. We have not carried out a detailed 
          assessment of whether non-audit advice is being provided to the audit side at 
          ‘below-market’ rates, given the complex analysis that this would require. 
          However, if this were the case, then it could be argued that the ‘true’ cost of 
          audit is not being reflected in the audit fee. It is not clear that this would 
          necessarily lead to worse audit quality, or to competition concerns given that 
          all of the major auditors (not just the big four) are able to access in-house 
          advice from their non-audit partners. However, it might reinforce the trend 
          towards combined audit and non-audit firms, since it would be more difficult 
          for a stand-alone audit firm to compete with the large multidisciplinary firms.  
       3.172 Overall then, we found limited evidence to support the various concerns 
          around ‘cross-subsidisation’. We acknowledge though that there are still 
          concerns that the audit may be priced ‘too low’ – by which we mean that there 
          might be benefits from a higher price if this meant higher quality. In our view, 
          this concern is more likely to be driven by the incentives within the selection 
          and oversight of auditors (set out above) rather than by the possibility of 
          cross-subsidisation.

               Wider impacts of the Big Four and the multi-disciplinary model 
               3.173 We are also concerned about the scale and reach of the audit firms and the 
                      impact this might have on audit quality. In the UK, at least 75% of revenues 
                      for the Big Four come from non-audit services. Non-audit revenues are also 
                      growing significantly faster than audit revenues. This leads to an inevitable 
                      focus of the firms’ senior management on non-audit work.  
               3.174 We set out below: 
                      (a)  findings from academic literature;  
                      (b)  recent FRC findings from its Thematic Review on Audit Culture; and 
                      (c)  our assessment drawing on various sources on the issues.  
               Academic literature  
               3.175 The Enron case prompted a debate on whether the provision of non-audit 
                      services by audit firms impairs audit quality even if the services are not 
                                                         177
                      provided to a firm’s audit clients.    In recent years the debate has intensified 
                      with a better articulation of the mechanisms through which the increasing 
                      importance of non-audit services could affect audit quality. These may fall 
                      under three categories: 
                      (a)  The provision of both audit and non-audit services generates internal 
                           competition for resources, including both staff and investments, and 
                           distracts the attention of senior managers away from audit. 
                      (b)  The impact on audit partners’ incentives of remuneration that depends on 
                           the profitability of the whole firm, including its non-audit business. With the 
                           provision of non-audit services accounting for an increasing fraction of a 
                           firm’s profits, the audit partners’ interest in the success of the non-audit 
                           business has increased.  
                      (c)  The literature has shown how the behaviour of individuals in an 
                           organisation both determines and is influenced by the social norms for the 
                                         178
                           organisation.     In the context of an audit firm, the provision of non-audit 
                           services can increase the salience of a social norm emphasising 
                           cooperation with client companies’ management, which contrasts with the 
                
                
               177
                  See, for example, (i) Wyatt, A. R. 2004. Accounting professionalism – They just don’t get it! Accounting

                                                            80 
                                                                                                                 
                            norms of accounting professionalism. Also, the importance of non-audit 
                            services for an audit firm may erode professional norms by increasing 
                            profit pressure. 
                3.176 These insights explain how the increasing importance of non-audit services 
                        for audit firms may impact on the firms’ culture, values and professionalism in 
                        ways that are detrimental to audit quality. Non-audit services typically involve 
                        working in collaboration with the client’s management. An auditor, on the 
                        other hand, is supposed to challenge management and provide an 
                        independent review of the client’s business. More generally, the combination 
                        of audit and non-audit services in a multi-disciplinary firm can create tension 
                        between an advisory culture focused on profitability and short-term interests, 
                        and an audit culture based on public interest and professional values. 
                3.177 A recent study on the Big Four in the US has found empirical evidence of a 
                        negative relation between the importance of non-audit services at the firm 
                                                 179
                        level and audit quality.     As the study controls for the provision of non-audit 
                                                   180
                        services to audit clients,     the observed impact on quality can only be 
                        explained as the result of internal competition for resources, non-audit fee 
                        pressure on audit partners, reduced management attention to audit, or a 
                        change in the firms’ culture.  
                3.178 Other studies have explored wider elements of the cultural relationship 
                        between audit firms and their clients. While not specifically relating to the 
                        provision of non-audit services, they indicate how the centrality of ‘client 
                        service’ within accounting firms may conflict with notions of independence, 
                                                               181
                        public service or ethical standards.       Auditors’ identification with their clients 
                        has been found to affect auditors’ objectivity even in the absence of financial 
                                    182
                        incentives.

                                                               81 
                                                 
          (a)  ‘High quality audit is supported by fundamental principles, rigorous 
            standards, due process and mandated quality assurance. However, 
            auditing, by its very nature, is judgemental and based on human decisions 
            and actions. There are many factors that influence the environment within 
            which auditors make their decisions and act. There can be tension 
            between these factors and auditors are faced with competing priorities.’  
          (b)  ‘In this context, it is important that firms create a culture where achieving 
            high quality audit work is valued and rewarded, and which emphasises 
            the importance of ‘doing the right thing’ in the public interest. Auditors 
            must also consider it their duty to serve the needs of shareholders, rather 
            than management of the audited entity’. 
       3.180 Key findings included: 
          (a)  ‘Culture has been designed (being purpose, values and encouraged 
            behaviours) for the whole multi-disciplinary firm. There are good examples 
            of firms keeping their cultural design current. In some firms, audit specific 
            values such as objectivity and independence are not sufficiently 
            prominent. All firms could do more to promote to partners and staff the 
            purpose of an audit and the societal value that it brings.’ 
          (b)  ‘Audit remains a core service line for all firms with representation from 
            auditors in senior leadership positions. Four of the eight firms prominently 
            included improving audit quality within their whole-firm strategies, four did 
            not. More could be done to promote audit specific values and make 
            auditors feel valued for the work they do.’ 
       Our assessment 
          Cultural pressures 
       3.181 There are clearly significant differences in the professional culture of audit and 
          the consultancy-based approach to many other non-audit services. For 
          example, we saw reference in a document provided by one of the audit firms 
          to the ‘duality of purpose’ between audit and non-audit services.  
       3.182 The objective in most consultancy-led services is to provide advice and 
          support that the client wants, working closely with that client. In contrast, high-
          quality audit requires independence from and challenge to the client and is, 
          ultimately, providing a product for the shareholders and wider public, rather 
          than for the client itself. 
                           82 
                                                 
       3.183 Qualified auditors will have undertaken years of training, tested by rigorous 
          examination. They will be members of a professional body. The practices and 
          values of the profession are fundamental to audit work. By contrast, 
          consultants will often not have formal professional qualifications or 
          recognition.  
       3.184 External regulation and internal controls exist to protect the professionalism of 
          the audit function within firms. We have been told, however, that there is only 
          so much that controls and procedures can do to ensure audit quality. 
          Ultimately, this relies on a commitment to professional standards that is 
          embedded in the culture, the training, and the identity of professionals. This is 
          reflected in the FRC findings from its Thematic Review.  
          Differential growth in audit and non-audit services 
       3.185 As set out above, audit accounts for a substantial and profitable part of the 
          business of the Big Four firms. However, it is less profitable than non-audit 
          services and the growth seen in recent years has been in the provision of 
          non-audit services. Based on current trends, audit practices are likely to 
          continue to decline in relative significance in the Big Four.  
       3.186 We have been told that, while the audit practice remains fundamental to the 
          reputation of the Big Four firms, this situation could make it more difficult for 
          partners in the audit practice, at the margin, to compete for resources and to 
          make the economic case of investment. Audit is also likely to be less 
          influential in determining the strategy and governance of the organisation.  
          Audit partner remuneration 
       3.187 Finally, the tensions between audit and non-audit services are also reflected 
          in the remuneration of audit partners, which is typically linked to the overall 
          profit earned by the firm across both audit and non-audit services. The 
          auditors told us that they typically operate a ‘points’ system for partner 
          remuneration, where the number of points is driven by audit performance, in 
          which measures of audit quality play an important part. However, these points 
          are then applied to the overall profit pool of the firm, covering both audit and 
          non-audit services. This means that audit partners are incentivised to care 
          about the overall performance of the firm (the majority of which relates to non-
          audit services).  
       Conclusion on impacts of the multi-disciplinary firm structure 
       3.188 Accounting firms have put in place a range of measures to ensure that their 
          audit partners focus on audit quality within the multi-disciplinary firm structure. 
                           83 
                                                 
          For example, we heard that they have rigorous internal checks on quality and 
          that partner remuneration is linked to measures of audit quality. They also 
          argued that maintaining audit quality is fundamental to the wider reputation of 
          the firm, including its non-audit services. We recognise that these factors all to 
          some extent counteract the concerns outlined above.  
       3.189 However, our provisional view is that these measures do not remove the 
          underlying tension created by the different objectives of audit and non-audit 
          work. As the proportion of non-audit services increases and the nature of 
          these services becomes further removed from the core audit function, so we 
          would expect these tensions to increase, undermining the incentives to focus 
          on independent, high-quality audit.  
                           84 
                                                                                          
             4.    Remedies 
             4.1   The previous section described the various factors that lead to the market 
                   failing to deliver high-quality audits. We reiterate these factors below. The 
                   remainder of this section sets out our views on a proposed package of 
                   remedies to address the issues we have found.  
                   (a)  Selection and oversight of auditors. This process is insufficiently 
                       focused on quality. Audit Committees are only a partial solution to the 
                       underlying problem that companies procure their own audits. 
                   (b)  Choice. There are limitations on choice, driven by a combination of 
                       regulatory requirements, firms’ structure, and barriers to competition from 
                       challenger firms; as well as concerns over the long-term resilience of the 
                       sector.  
                   (c)  Firms’ structure. The structure of audit firms results in weaker incentives 
                       to deliver high-quality audits, because a significant majority of the firms’ 
                       business is outside audit.  
                   (d)  Regulation. The general quality of regulation has been considered 
                       alongside this study by the independent review of the FRC, led by Sir 
                       John Kingman, so we do not consider that subject here, beyond noting 
                       that various stakeholders have reinforced the Carillion Select Committee’s 
                       view that regulation has been inadequate.  
             4.2   Competition and regulation should work hand in hand to ensure that audit 
                   firms and individuals within those audit firms have the maximum incentives to 
                   carry out high-quality audits. In practice this means a combination of the 
                   following mechanisms: 
                   (a)  Selection and oversight of auditors would ensure that competition is 
                       focused on quality (more than price), so that firms win more business if 
                       they deliver good quality and lose business if their quality is poor.  
                   (b)  There would be (i) enough opportunities to compete, and (ii) sufficient 
                       choice of viable competitor firms over the long term, without undue 
                       barriers to entry and expansion, all to enable intense competition.  
                   (c)  Within firms, individual auditors’ personal success would depend to a very 
                       large extent on whether they deliver high-quality audits.

                 4.5     We have borne in mind the following principles to assess the remedies. The 
                         proposals need to: 
                         (a)  address the underlying quality concerns that we have identified; 
                         (b)  be implemented, monitored and enforced effectively; 
                         (c)  be proportionate to the scale of the issue; and 
                         (d)  consider the potential risks and unintended consequences. 
                 4.6     We welcome views on whether, and how, each of our proposed remedies 
                         addresses these principles.  
                 Proposed remedies 
                 Remedy 1: Regulatory scrutiny of Audit Committees  
                 Introduction 
                 4.7     Auditors must be properly incentivised to deliver sceptical and challenging 
                         audits. This requires auditors to be independent and, if necessary, willing to 
                         make difficult decisions in the face of opposition from company management. 
                         It is the role of Audit Committees to ensure that this happens.  
                 4.8     As set out above, measures introduced by the CC and the EU Audit 
                         Regulation were designed to strengthen the role of the Audit Committee to 
                         better align the auditor’s incentives with shareholders, rather than company 
                         management. However, the evidence does not inspire confidence that Audit 
                         Committees consistently prioritise quality. 
                 4.9     One way to re-orient the incentives on auditors to focus on providing high 
                         quality audit based on professional scepticism and challenge would be to 
                         remove the responsibility for the audit selection processes, and audit 
                         engagement monitoring, from companies altogether. These responsibilities 
                         could instead be undertaken by an independent body. This would break the 
                         link between company management and audit firm appointment and 
                         reappointment – creating an environment where audit firms are better 
                         incentivised to provide challenging audits. An independent body could also 
                                                                   87 
                                                 
          reduce barriers to challenger firms by ensuring that selection procedures are 
          not biased.  
       4.10  Most stakeholders, including investors, were opposed to an independent 
          appointment and monitoring body. We heard that this remedy would 
          disenfranchise shareholders and that an independent body would be 
          incapable of replicating the functions of Audit Committees.  
       4.11  We do not agree that the remedy would disenfranchise shareholders – it could 
          be designed so that shareholders retained the final vote just as they do today. 
          We are also unpersuaded that a well-resourced independent body would be 
          incapable of replicating the functions of Audit Committees (as explained 
          above; Audit Committee members on average spent less than 35 hours on 
          matters relating to the statutory audit in the last financial year).  
       4.12  However, we have concerns at shareholders’ widespread opposition to this 
          proposal, and our current understanding is that a blanket generic removal of 
          Audit Committees’ functions and/or shareholders’ rights to appoint the auditor 
          would be inconsistent with the current EU legislative framework. Therefore, 
          barriers exist to creating an independent audit appointment and monitoring 
          body in the short term. 
       4.13  Nonetheless, there are substantial changes that can be made to the current 
          Audit Committee framework to ensure that auditor incentives are appropriately 
          aligned towards quality. These changes potentially go much further than the 
          previous CC and EU reforms.  
       Aims of the remedy 
       4.14  This remedy would ensure that Audit Committees fully protect the interests of 
          shareholders when making decisions about auditor selection and monitoring 
          the audit engagement. In turn, this remedy will improve incentives for high-
          quality audits. This remedy would also ensure that challenger firms are not 
          unfairly disadvantaged due to biases during audit selection procedures. 
       How the remedy would work in practice 
       4.15  The key element of this remedy is strong regulation of Audit Committees – to 
          ensure they are all doing the job they are meant to do. 
       4.16  The type of oversight mechanisms we envisage would provide a step change 
          in Audit Committee practice. These include: 
          (a)  A requirement that Audit Committees report directly to the regulator 
            before, during and after a tender selection process. To strengthen this 
                           88 
                                                                                                                                                       
                                      requirement, a representative from the regulator could sit as an observer 
                                      either on all Audit Committees or, for example, where process or quality 
                                      issues had been identified by the regulator in the past. The Audit 
                                      Committee would be required to demonstrate that it: 
                                      (i)   prioritised independence and challenge in its tender assessment; 
                                                                                                                                       184
                                      (ii)  made its decisions independently of company management;                                          
                                      (iii)  competently managed conflicts of interest so as to maximise choice at 
                                            the time of the audit tender; and 
                                      (iv) gave fair consideration to challenger firms – having an objective 
                                            justification for excluding any challenger firm. 
                               (b)  A requirement that Audit Committees report directly to the regulator 
                                      throughout the audit engagement – demonstrating how they are 
                                      monitoring quality. This requirement could be monitored through the 
                                      observer described above or, for Audit Committees with no observer, 
                                      through the regulator having a right of inspection at any time. Audit 
                                      Committees would be required to: 
                                      (i)   demonstrate that they had made meaningful interventions to assess 
                                            quality beyond simply seeking management feedback; and 
                                      (ii)  provide the regulator with an account of material disagreements 
                                            between the audit firm and management, including the role of the 
                                            Audit Committee in these discussions.  
                               (c)  The ability for the regulator to issue public reprimands, or direct 
                                      statements to shareholders in circumstances where it is not satisfied 
                                                                                                                    185
                                      Audit Committees have followed proper procedures.                                   
                     4.17  It would also be helpful for the regulator to make public, as far as it is able, the 
                               results of any assessments of quality it undertakes, such as the AQRs, in 
                               order to ensure Audit Committees have maximum access to information on 
                               quality.  
                     4.18  Our current view is that this enhanced oversight regime should apply to all 
                               FTSE 350 Audit Committees, at least initially. However, we would welcome 
                      
                      
                     184
                         Not all companies are required to have independent Audit Committees. In circumstances where the role of the 
                     Audit Committee is performed by company management, some of these oversight mechanisms would still be 
                     applicable. 
                     185
                         As part of this remedy, appropriate restrictions would be put in place to prevent the disclosure by the regulator 
                     of any company’s commercially sensitive information. 
                                                                                    89 
                                                                                                        
                      views on whether this should be extended to include a wider group of the 
                      largest companies, such as all PIEs. We propose a right of inspection for the 
                      regulator in respect of other large companies. 
               Views of the parties 
               4.19  Grant Thornton supported an independent auditor appointment body on the 
                      grounds that it would promote independence and address potential bias in the 
                      procurement of audit by large companies in the UK. It added that this would 
                      balance the interests of all the various stakeholders and place the public 
                                                                            186
                      interest at the heart of the auditor selection process.   
               4.20  However, many other stakeholders overwhelmingly opposed replacing Audit 
                      Committees with an independent body. They told us that Audit Committees 
                      performed an important role to a high standard. For example, BDO stressed 
                      that an Audit Committee played a key role in the audit process and had a 
                      broad and deep understanding of the business and of the industry and 
                                                      187
                      environment that it operates in.    KPMG submitted that, in its experience, 
                      Audit Committees and members thereof generally take their responsibilities 
                                                               188
                      seriously and discharge them diligently.      
               4.21  Nonetheless, there was widespread support for strengthening oversight of the 
                      existing Audit Committee framework. For example: 
                      (a)  EY suggested closer dialogue between Audit Committees and a regulator, 
                          and providing a regulator with the power to recommend to an Audit 
                          Committee that the company’s auditor be changed where it can be 
                          demonstrated through the inspection and enforcement process that there 
                          have been repeated instances of failures of professional judgment or 
                                                                            189
                          scepticism in the auditor’s audit of the company.      
                      (b)  PwC suggested that Audit Committees could be required to report to an 
                          independent body on their preliminary appointment, fee and scope 
                                                                                                  190
                          decisions and respond to challenges before final decisions are made.         
                      (c)  Deloitte supported measures that would strengthen Audit Committees and 
                                                      191
                          their links to shareholders.

                4.22  A number of parties also suggested that Audit Committees should be asked to 
                                                                                                        192
                        provide better information to those they represent to enhance their role.           For 
                        example, the Investment Association stated Audit Committees should assert 
                        whether they believe the audit had been challenging, the granularity of key 
                        accounting issues and how the auditor challenged management’s judgement 
                                                                                     193
                        and assertions and exercised professional scepticism.            
                Our assessment of the remedy 
                4.23  The evidence on the performance of Audit Committees is mixed (see above). 
                        But even a few Audit Committees falling short in meeting their obligations is 
                        too many. The CC’s remedies and subsequent EU Regulation were a step in 
                        the right direction but did not go far enough.  
                4.24  We therefore propose recommending a remedy that calls for strong regulatory 
                        oversight of Audit Committees with meaningful consequences for poor 
                        performance. This remedy would: 
                        (a)  ensure that Audit Committees are fully incentivised to demand 
                            independence and challenge from auditors; and 
                        (b)  create a more level playing field for challenger firms. As set out above, 
                            many selection processes we reviewed did not meet the required 
                            standards of transparency and non-discrimination.  
                4.25  These changes would in turn ensure that competition is focused on delivering 
                        quality audits.  
                Summary: regulatory scrutiny of Audit Committees 
                Audit Committees should be subject to specific regulatory requirements and 
                obligations. Our current view is that this regulation should include: 
                    •   A requirement that Audit Committees report directly to the regulator before, 
                        during and after a tender selection process. The regulator would also have 
                        the ability to include an observer on all or a sample of Audit Committees.  
                    •   A requirement that Audit Committees report directly to the regulator 
                        throughout the audit engagement. 
                    •   The ability for the regulator to issue public reprimands or direct statements to 
                        shareholders.

       The remedy should apply to at least all FTSE 350 Audit Committees but we would 
       welcome views on whether this remedy should be extended to cover a wider group 
       of companies, such as all PIEs.  
       Remedy 2: Mandatory joint audit 
       Introduction 
       4.26  A joint audit would require two firms to sign off on the accounts of their audit 
          client. Responsibility for the audit opinion, and audit liability, would rest with 
          both auditors. 
       4.27  One version of the remedy would be to leave companies free to choose any 
          two (or more) auditors. Another possibility would set up specific incentives or 
          requirements designed to ensure that at least one of the two auditors was a 
          challenger firm.  
       4.28  In our invitation to comment, we also mentioned the possibility of introducing 
          shared audit as an alternative to joint audit. A shared audit would be carried 
          out with one firm (the statutory auditor) taking overall control, responsibility 
          and liability for the audit. Another audit firm would support the statutory auditor 
          on certain aspects of the audit (e.g. carrying out audit functions on 
          subsidiaries). As we discuss below, our current view is that shared audit 
          would not be as effective as joint audit in achieving the remedy’s aims.  
       Aims of the remedy 
       4.29  The aim of this remedy would be to reduce the barriers to auditing large 
          companies faced by the challenger firms. This remedy would lead, in the 
          medium term, to improvements in the quality and capability of the challenger 
          firms and to stronger competition in the provision of audit, and improved 
          market resilience. Joint audit also has the potential to improve audit quality. 
       Design and implementation of the remedy 
       4.30  The audited company would select each of the joint auditors through a 
          separate tender. The joint auditors would be appointed at different times so 
          their terms would not end at the same point, retaining the ongoing auditor’s 
          knowledge of the company to allow for a smooth transition. 
       4.31  Each auditor would form its own understanding of the company and 
          assessment of audit risk. Together, the joint auditors would prepare an overall 
          audit plan and propose it to the company’s Audit Committee. This plan would 
                           92 
                                                                                                                  
                        need to ensure that work is divided between the auditors efficiently, for 
                        example based along geographic lines or legal entities. 
                4.32  Each of the auditors would then conduct its respective part of the audit in 
                        accordance with the audit plan and then conduct a cross review of the 
                        relevant parts of the audit – particularly the consolidation of the component 
                        parts of the company. Following this, the joint auditors would establish a joint 
                        audit opinion. 
                4.33  Implementation of this remedy is likely to require regulatory oversight from the 
                        start: the regulator will need to set out how the regime would operate and then 
                        oversee the Audit Committees’ implementation of it. 
                4.34  The remedy would include the requirement for a balanced approach in 
                        sharing audit work among the joint auditors, with regular changes in the 
                        allocation of audit procedures between the joint auditors over the years. Each 
                        auditor would therefore undertake a significant part of the overall audit 
                        procedure, from both a quantitative and a qualitative point of view. The 
                        remedy would set a minimum share of audit work to be undertaken by each of 
                        the joint auditors.  
                4.35  There are a number of possible ways this minimum share could be calculated. 
                        In any model the minimum share is likely to need to vary according to the size 
                        of the audited company, with more equal shares required for smaller 
                        companies. This would be important if the remedy mandated the presence of 
                        one challenger firm in each joint auditor pair, as challenger firms, at least 
                        initially, would not have sufficient capacity to undertake a large proportion of 
                        the audit work for very large clients.  
                        (a)  One option would be for the share of the audit fees (which could be 
                            correlated to workload) achieved in the short to medium term to be set 
                            along a sliding scale. As an illustrative example, one way this could be 
                            achieved would be for the largest firms in the FTSE 100 to be required to 
                                                                                                   194
                            have a joint auditor earning at least 10% of the total audit fee.         This 
                            percentage could then increase as the size of firm decreased so that the 
                            smallest firms in the FTSE 350 would be required to have a joint auditor 
                            earning at least 40% or 50% of the total audit fee. In the long run, the 
                            regulator could then consider increasing some of these targets. For 
                            example, the 10% minimum share for the top 50 audited companies could 
                            be gradually increased as the challenger firms build their capacity.  
                 
                 
                194
                   We recognise that the constituent members of the FTSE100, FTSE250 and FTSE350 change on a regular 
                basis and any remedy will need to take account of that in its design 
                                                               93 
                                                                                                               
                       (b)  Another alternative could be to set a minimum joint audit percentage 
                            (such as 20%, 30% or 40%) which would not initially apply to the largest 
                            companies in the FTSE 350. This percentage would increase over time 
                            and over time increasing numbers of the largest firms would be included 
                            in the requirement. 
                4.36  However, there are some types of companies, such as banks, where the 
                       challenger firms may currently not have the required skills to perform an audit. 
                       This suggests that allowing two Big Four firms to act as joint auditors could be 
                                                     195
                       a more appropriate option.        This would lead to greater resilience of the 
                       market for financial services and sectors that are currently audited by only 
                       some of the Big Four firms. Other than these specific examples we would 
                       expect that companies would have a challenger firm as one of their joint 
                       auditors.  
                4.37  It is likely to be necessary for this remedy to be phased in over time to avoid 
                       the immediate need for a large number of tenders, and also to allow the 
                       challenger firms to prepare for a large increase in workload both to participate 
                       in tenders and to do the work on those accounts where their bid was 
                       successful. For example, the requirement could be made applicable from the 
                       next re-tendering point or it may be appropriate to implement joint audit in 
                       respect of the FTSE 250 before the FTSE100 so that UK firms can become 
                       familiar with the new working processes before jointly undertaking the UK’s 
                       largest and most complex audits.  
                4.38  There may be a need for some specific exceptions for the requirement for 
                       joint audit. There may be companies which, despite large market 
                       capitalisations, have audits that are simple and difficult to divide sensibly 
                       between two auditors – investment trusts have been cited as an example.  
                4.39  Finally, an important aspect of our joint audit remedy is that both auditors 
                       would take responsibility for a material part of the audit, with both auditors 
                       presenting their findings to the board, and both auditors having joint liability. 
                       Consolidated accounts would be audited by both joint auditors and then 
                       cross-reviewed. Some parties have proposed that liability in the case of joint 
                       audit should be proportionate, rather than auditors being jointly or severally 
                       liable. This would represent a major departure from the UK’s current liability 
                       regime and would require further significant consideration. 
                 
                 
                195
                   Alternatively, if a mandatory requirement for one challenger auditor was implemented, there would need to be 
                flexibility to allow for instances where two Big Four firms were necessary as the joint auditors – for example, due 
                to capacity constraints with challenger firms, or due to particular sector circumstances. 
                                                              94 
                                                                                                             
               Views of the parties 
               4.40  The challenger firms and other stakeholders including some ACCs with direct 
                       experience of joint audits viewed them positively (with the partial exception of 
                             196
                       BDO).  The arguments put forward by the parties in favour of joint audit 
                       were that:  
                       (a)  joint audit could create better quality audits by combining the 
                           complementary technical expertise, sector insight, experience and 
                           geographical reach of two or more audit firms; 
                       (b)  the combination of two audit firms should strengthen the auditors’ position 
                           in the event of client resistance to a particular course of action; 
                       (c)  by allowing auditor appointments to be made on a staggered basis, joint 
                           audit could make auditor rotation smoother, striking a balance between 
                           the deep knowledge of the ongoing auditor and the fresh pair of eyes 
                           brought by the newly appointed auditor; and 
                       (d)  the introduction of joint audit could improve resilience in the market, by 
                           allowing smaller audit firms to grow and become more competitive vis a 
                           vis the Big Four firms. 
               4.41  Most of the ACCs we spoke to and the Big Four expressed opposition to this 
                       remedy, while the views of investors were mixed. The parties opposed to the 
                       introduction of joint audit argued that: 
                       (a)  there is no evidence that joint audits improve audit quality, independence 
                           or choice; 
                       (b)  each joint auditor would only have partial oversight, or automatically rely 
                           on each other’s review, which could lead to issues being missed or ‘falling 
                           through the gaps’; 
                       (c)  the involvement of two firms in an audit would lead to some degree of 
                           duplication and therefore higher audit fees, and possibly delays in the 
                           process; 
                       (d)  as both joint auditors must sign off on the same audit, liability for any 
                           problems is jointly held and an ‘innocent party’ to a weak audit could be 
                
                
               196
                  BDO submitted that joint audit could create a significant cost and time burden on companies that is potentially 
               disproportionate to any benefit; however, BDO could envisage the introduction of joint audit as part of a package 
               of measures including market share caps. BDO’s submission to the ITC, page 6. 
                                                            95 
                                                                                                                     
                             liable for all of the liability incurred; assuming liability for another firm’s 
                             work may not be acceptable to some firms in some scenarios; and 
                        (e)  joint audit implies that two audit firms, instead of one, would be precluded 
                             from tendering for an audit when they are subject to mandatory rotation, 
                             reducing choice; moreover, the presence of two auditors would reduce the 
                             choice of providers of those non-audit services that auditors are not 
                             allowed to supply to their clients. 
                4.42  Finally, some parties said that there should be some reform of the joint and 
                        several liability model that presently applies in joint audits in the UK, to one of 
                        proportional liability. Some parties also submitted that there could be some 
                        types of companies, such as banks, where there may not be many (potentially 
                        any) challenger firms who believe they have the requisite skills, knowledge, 
                        experience or appetite to be appointed as joint auditor. 
                4.43  Parties’ views on shared audit were less polarised: the largest auditors were 
                        not opposed to it, while the challenger firms who expressed a view considered 
                        it a positive step, but inferior to joint audit: 
                        (a)  Deloitte told us that it would potentially support the introduction of a 
                             shared audit (particularly in combination with another measure, such as a 
                             market share cap) to enable audit firms outside the four largest ones to 
                                                                        197
                             develop skills and increase capacity.          
                        (b)  PwC argued that, compared to joint audit, shared audit may alleviate the 
                                                                                198
                             ‘falling through the gaps’ issue to an extent.         
                        (c)  KPMG stated that it was not opposed to exploring possibilities in relation 
                             to some form of shared audit (or peer reviews) and that this option better 
                                                                                                    199
                             managed some of the challenges associated with joint audit.               
                        (d)  Mazars, which strongly supports joint audit, recognised that shared audit 
                             may have a place in the early years of a dual appointment as the 
                             challenger firm builds up its share of the group audit undertaken to an

                             goal.     
                4.44  Some parties, however, expressed serious concerns with shared audit, 
                        submitting that it would give rise to issues of reliance of one auditor on 
                        another and that this had been identified as an area of weakness in recent 
                        FRC audit reviews of group entity audits. Some of the strongest opposition we 
                        heard to joint audit appears to have been based on misconceptions about 
                                                                                    202
                        failings of shared audits assumed to be joint audits.            
                Our assessment of the remedy 
                                                                                       203
                4.45  The lower concentration of the audit market in France               , where joint audit is 
                        mandatory, suggests that the introduction of joint audit in the UK is likely to 
                                                                                                              204
                        lead to a significant increase in the share of audit fees of challenger firms.            
                        This is supported by the results of a simulation in a recently published 
                               205
                        study.     Joint audit would result in lower market concentration even if the 
                        presence of a challenger firm in a joint audit pair was not mandated. In 
                        France, where there is no restriction on the composition of joint audit pairs, a 
                        significant minority of large firms have chosen audit pairs with one Big Four 
                                                          206
                        firm and one challenger firm.         
                4.46  In contrast to a joint audit, a shared audit is less likely to be effective in 
                        promoting resilience and choice as challenger firms would be more likely to 
                        remain subordinate to Big Four statutory auditors – with the Big Four firm 
                        dictating how the audit will be carried out, and retaining overall responsibility 
                        for the engagement. 
                        Impact on choice and competition 
                4.47  We have received less evidence with respect to the impact of the remedy on 
                        choice and competition, but overall the evidence indicates that choice of 
                        auditor should increase, as discussed below.

                204
                    Where appropriate, we have followed the French model for joint audits in designing this remedy.

                Accounting Studies, 22(4), 1595-1627. This study suggests that the introduction of joint audit would eventually 
                result in the emergence of at least one Challenger firm of a size comparable to the Big Four. 
                206
                    See Guo et al. (2017). 
                                                                 97 
                                                                                                               
                4.48  Joint audit would increase competition from challenger firms if joint audit work 
                       enabled these firms to acquire the capacities and reputation to make them 
                       able to compete for the role of ‘lead’ joint auditor. Should challenger firms 
                       remain confined in a role as ‘junior’ auditor, competition for the largest audits 
                       would effectively remain limited to the Big Four. In this regard, data from 
                       France provides mixed evidence. On the one hand, the largest companies 
                       tend to prefer joint audit pairs composed of two Big Four firms; on the other 
                       hand, a significant minority of large firms have chosen audit pairs with one Big 
                       Four and one challenger firm, and the workload in these cases is shared 
                       between the joint auditors in a fairly balanced way, with the challenger firm 
                                                                           207
                       often receiving more than 40% of the audit fee.         This indicates that, in a 
                       significant number of cases, challenger firms are perceived as being on a par 
                       with the Big Four.  
                4.49  The evidence above, although limited, gives us some confidence that choice 
                       would increase as a result of the introduction of joint audit in the UK, with the 
                       possible exception of the largest or most complex companies in the FTSE350. 
                4.50  The impact of joint audit on competition between the Big Four depends on 
                       how the remedy is designed.  
                       (a)  If the remedy mandates that audit pairs must include a non-Big Four 
                            auditor, then there would be no change in the relative strength of 
                            competition between the Big Four, who will continue to compete for one 
                            auditor role in a similar way to how they currently compete for the role of 
                            sole auditor.  
                       (b)  If audit pairs were allowed to include two Big Four firms, then the remedy 
                            could reduce competition between the Big Four. When bidding for an 
                            auditor role, a Big Four firm might take into account that, if its bid was 
                            unsuccessful, it would have a chance to be subsequently selected as the 
                            other joint auditor. This chance could be particularly high in the case of 
                            the largest firms, which, as shown by the data for France, have a 
                            preference for hiring two Big Four auditors. This may give any Big Four an 
                            incentive to bid less aggressively. Such effect, however, would be 
                            counterbalanced in the long term by increasing competition from 
                            challenger firms.  
                 
                 
                207
                   The data has been taken from Guo et al. (2017) and covers the period 2006-2012. 
                                                              98 
                                                                                                            
                      Impact on resilience  
               4.51  As discussed above, we expect that the remedy would lead to a significant 
                      increase in the size of some challenger firms. We would expect that this would 
                      make the audit market more resilient as, in the event of the failure of one of 
                      the Big Four, the larger size of the challenger firms would enable them to 
                      attract senior staff more easily from the failed auditor and induce large 
                      companies to begin choosing them as auditors. Given the concerns 
                      expressed, there is greater uncertainty over whether the same outcome could 
                      be achieved through a shared audit remedy. 
                      Impact on audit quality  
               4.52  As described above, parties submitted a wide range of reasons why joint audit 
                      could result in higher or lower audit quality. The arguments pointing towards 
                      an increase in audit quality have all been recognised in economic literature. In 
                      addition, it has been argued that the threat to auditor independence due to 
                      economic bonding with the audited company is likely to be lower under joint 
                      audit, as audit and non-audit fees are distributed between two different audit 
                      firms and there are therefore lower fees at stake.  
               4.53  On the other hand, the economic literature also suggests reasons why quality 
                      could instead decrease, in addition to the possibility of issues ‘falling through 
                      the gaps’. In particular, it has been argued that the smaller of the joint 
                      auditors, bearing a smaller proportion of the costs in case of audit failure 
                      (litigation risk and reputation loss), would have an incentive to ‘free ride’ on 
                      the effort of the larger audit firm; moreover, joint audit may provide an audited 
                      company with greater opportunity for ‘opinion shopping’ between the two 
                                208
                      auditors.      
               4.54  Given the contrasting theoretical arguments, the question of whether joint 
                      audit leads to higher quality can only be answered empirically. Parties have 
                      submitted anecdotal evidence that joint audit makes auditors better able to 
                      challenge a company’s management. The Haut Conseil du Commissariat aux 
                      Comptes (H3C), the French public audit oversight body, also expressed to us 
                      its strong belief in the positive impact of joint audit on audit quality. The H3C 
                      did not share the view that issues might ‘fall through the gaps’, stating that, 
                      subject to effective communication between the joint auditors, joint audit 
                      required an appropriate cross-review of the audit work by the other auditor 
                      and would in fact increase the level of professional scepticism. 
                
                
               208
                  See Deng, M., T. Lu, D.A. Simunic, and M. Ye (2014) Do Joint Audits Improve or Impair Audit Quality?, 
               Journal of Accounting Research, 52(5), 1029-1060. 
                                                            99 
                                                                                                             
               4.55  While several empirical studies have been conducted on the impact of joint 
                       audit on audit quality, the conclusions are mixed. In particular, the literature 
                       has not established a clear link between mandatory joint audit and audit 
                              209
                       quality.   Conversely, there is no clear evidence that audit quality is lower in 
                       a joint audit regime. We therefore expect that the introduction of mandatory 
                       joint audit in the UK would not lead to a reduction in audit quality and may 
                       result in higher quality through creating incentives for greater professional 
                       scepticism. 
               4.56  Finally, we are not convinced by the argument put forward by PwC that the 
                       ‘falling through the gaps’ issue would be alleviated to an extent if shared audit, 
                       rather than joint audit, were adopted. Unlike with joint audit, the audit firm 
                       responsible for auditing certain functions or subsidiaries would not be liable 
                       for the audit opinion. This would further increase its incentive to ‘free ride’ on 
                       the statutory auditor. As noted by some parties, many examples of poor co-
                       ordination and oversight of the work of the various component auditors, which 
                       are often required when auditing multinational enterprises, have been 
                       identified in audit inspections by independent audit regulators. The 
                       introduction of mandatory shared audit may exacerbate this issue.  
                       Impact on audit fees 
               4.57  It is widely acknowledged in the economic literature, and recognised by many 
                       of the respondents to our invitation to comment document, that the 
                       introduction of joint audit will lead to an increase in audit fees. Estimates of 
                       the size of any increase vary significantly but the literature, based on an 
                       analysis of audit fees in Denmark before and after the abandonment of 
                       mandatory joint audit in 2005 and on comparisons between audit fees in 
                       France and in other European countries, suggests that audit fees could 
                                             210
                       increase by 25-50%.       However we have also received submissions, based 
                       on bottom-up estimates, that the actual level of cost increase is likely to be 
                       lower than this, up to 20%.

                       oversees adherence to those principles would not result in unnecessary 
                       duplication.  
                       Other considerations 
                4.59  Some parties submitted that some audit firms may be unwilling to assume 
                       liability for another firm’s work. While it is uncertain whether joint audits 
                       increase the risks faced by audit firms, we do not think this issue would 
                       undermine the viability of the remedy, as shown by the operation of joint audit 
                       in France. As noted above, further consideration would need to be given as to 
                       whether a proportionate liability regime would be desirable. We note that 
                       some UK auditors already perform joint audits notwithstanding the joint and 
                       several liability regime.  
                4.60  Finally, joint audit implies the exclusion of two audit firms from the tender 
                       process when mandatory auditor rotation is required (i.e. the outgoing 
                       incumbent and the other joint auditor). However, since challenger firms are 
                       currently typically excluded from tendering for large companies’ audits (by the 
                       Audit Committees), joint audit would not lead to a further reduction in choice 
                       except if a company had a strong preference for appointing two Big Four firms 
                                              211
                       as the joint auditors.     
                Summary: Joint audit 
                Our provisional view is that joint audit would increase competition without risking 
                audit quality. Our initial views on design are: 
                •   The main aim of this remedy is to reduce the barriers facing challenger firms. 
                    Our preferred way of achieving this would be by mandating that at least one of 
                    the audit pair is a challenger firm. We would welcome views on any alternative 
                    ways of delivering this outcome and ensuring that the remedy is effective in 
                    reducing concentration. 
                •   This remedy should at least apply to FTSE 350 companies – perhaps with some 
                    limited exceptions where the nature of the company would not sensibly justify a 
                    joint audit. We seek views on whether this remedy should apply to other large 
                    companies or whether specific types of company should be excluded. 
                 
                 
                211
                   Joint audit would also imply a reduction in the number of potential suppliers of those non-audit services that 
                auditors are not allowed to provide to their clients, as two firms would not be allowed to provide them. This, 
                however, would cause a significant reduction in choice only for services that could be provided by a small number 
                of firms and, most likely, only in the case of the appointment of two Big Four joint auditors. 
                                                              101 
                                                                                                                        
                 •   Each joint auditor should have to be granted a significant proportion of the audit 
                     work. The minimum proportion to be assigned to any joint auditor might vary 
                     across the FTSE 350 companies and over time to allow challenger firms to build 
                     their capacity. 
                 Remedy 2A: Market share cap 
                 Introduction 
                 4.61  As a potential alternative to mandatory joint audit, we have considered a 
                         market share cap. This remedy would involve imposing a market share cap on 
                         the Big Four firms, so that a given proportion of the market is reserved for 
                         challenger firms. There are in principle many ways in which a cap could be 
                         designed, in terms of its level, the way it is computed and the part of the audit 
                         market it applies to.  
                 4.62  A market share cap could be imposed on audits of all PIEs, on audits of 
                         FTSE 350 companies, or on subsets of those categories. It would also be 
                         possible to impose multiple caps on various segments of the market, based 
                         on company size or on the industry in which they operate. In each of these 
                         cases, a cap could constrain the market share of the Big Four firms 
                         collectively or of each of them individually. Caps could be defined in terms of 
                         the number of clients that the Big Four audit, the proportion of audit fees 
                         accounted by their clients, or by weighting clients based on their capitalisation 
                         or turnover.  
                 4.63  Finally, the level of the cap would have to be sufficiently low to allow 
                         challenger firms to reach the size that would enable them to compete 
                         effectively with the Big Four. The level could also be dynamically adjusted to 
                         reflect the increasing capabilities of challenger firms. 
                 Aims of the remedy 
                 4.64  A market share cap would aim to reduce the barriers for challenger firms to 
                         compete with the Big Four. The underlying principle is that, by temporarily 
                         shielding challenger firms from competition with the Big Four, a market share 
                         cap would allow them to achieve greater scale and experience, so that in the 
                         long term they would become more effective competitors for the audit of large 
                         companies. In the long term, the remedy would increase the choice of auditor 
                         available to large companies and improve the resilience of the audit market. 
                                                                  102 
                                                 
       Design and implementation of the remedy 
       4.65  Any market share cap should be designed to satisfy the following conditions: 
          (a)  Challenger firms should not end up auditing only the smallest companies 
            in the FTSE 350. As audit fees are very unevenly distributed across FTSE 
            350 companies, even a significant number of the smallest clients would 
            be unlikely to allow Challenger firms to gain sufficient scale and 
            experience to be able to compete for the audit of larger companies. 
          (b)  Challenger firms should be given sufficient time to increase their 
            capabilities and not be placed in a situation where they are required to 
            audit companies for which they have not yet developed the necessary 
            capabilities. 
          (c)  The Big Four should not be allowed to ‘cherry pick’ their clients. As 
            submitted by several parties, the Big Four would have an incentive to 
            compete for the largest, most profitable and/or less ‘risky’ clients. This 
            could potentially leave Challenger firms with an unattractive portfolio of 
            clients. 
          (d)  Companies should not be allowed to game the system by locking 
            themselves into long-term audit contracts soon before the cap enters into 
            force. Under the current tender regulations, FTSE 350 companies are 
            required to put audit services to tender every ten years. If awareness of 
            the future introduction of a cap led many companies to re-tender, the 
            remedy would be largely ineffective for a long time.  
       4.66  While a system based on audit fees would be directly linked to the most 
          relevant measure of audit firms’ size, it could be difficult to implement. This 
          design of cap would be complex to create as firms would not know the fees to 
          be billed to companies at the beginning of any relevant reporting period and, 
          as fees change, a cap could be broken through no fault of any one firm. In 
          addition, apportioning fees to the UK that are agreed at a global level would 
          involve an element of subjectivity and exchange rate fluctuations, which would 
          introduce additional complications. Weighting clients by capitalisation or 
          turnover would also be complex, as the weights would change from year to 
          year, making it difficult for the parties involved to predict whether an audit firm 
          would be constrained by the cap.  
       4.67  A cap based on the number of companies that the Big Four are allowed to 
          audit would be easier to implement. As discussed below, it should be possible 
          to achieve the long-term aim of making challenger firms more competitive 
          even with a cap based on the number of clients.  
                           103 
                                                                                                              
               4.68  A market share cap on individual firms would be significantly easier to 
                       implement and monitor than a collective cap on the Big Four. With a collective 
                       cap, individual Big Four firms would not know whether they would be able to 
                       take up particular tenders, because that would depend on the success of 
                       other Big Four auditors in other tenders. Conversely, with an individual cap 
                       each firm would know its position relative to the cap and could plan how to bid 
                       for future contracts. While setting individual caps requires deciding the level to 
                       apply to each audit firm, this added complexity is a minor issue compared to 
                       the difficulty of implementing a collective cap. Further consideration would 
                       need to be given to the level of the cap. 
               4.69  There are a large number of potential options on how a market share cap 
                       could be designed. In the following paragraphs, we outline two possible 
                       options by way of illustration. In the first, the Big Four are left free to choose 
                       how to bring their market shares within the cap; in the second, that freedom is 
                       removed.  
                       Option one 
               4.70  One possibility would be to set a market share cap to be reached within a 
                       given time period (possibly adopting a glide path) but leave the Big Four free 
                       to determine how to reach it. Each of the Big Four would therefore decide 
                       which existing clients to retain and which new clients to bid for. Under this 
                       option, the Big Four would have a strong incentive to keep the largest, most 
                       profitable clients, leaving the smallest clients to the challenger firms.  
               4.71  The ability to ‘cherry pick’ the best clients could however be mitigated by 
                       setting multiple caps over subsets of FTSE 350 companies, based on the 
                                                                                         212
                       companies’ size and on the industries in which they operate.          Such caps 
                       might have to be introduced in different stages, to avoid challenger firms 
                       having to audit companies for which they have not yet developed the required 
                       capabilities. In particular, FTSE 100 companies might be initially excluded 
                       from the cap. This would require a regulator overseeing and managing the 
                       remedy, deciding which companies the caps should cover, and the 
                       appropriate time for introducing the various caps.  
                
                
               212
                  It is less clear whether the caps should also reflect the different level of clients’ ‘riskiness’. In a well-functioning 
               market, we would expect higher-risk audits to command a higher audit fee. However, we have been told by 
               parties on all sides of the market that this does not currently happen. Therefore, there is a risk that cherry picking 
               would leave challenger firms with riskier audits. Although they might be able to negotiate higher fees for these 
               audits, there is a concern that challenger firms would be left auditing companies where failure is more likely to 
               occur. 
                                                            104 
                                                 
          Option two 
       4.72  If the ‘cherry picking’ issue is considered particularly serious, the remedy 
          could include a prohibition on the Big Four resigning without the audited 
          company’s approval and should be designed in a way that the Big Four are 
          not free to choose which companies to bid for, therefore satisfying condition 
          (c). In theory, this could be achieved by identifying groups of companies for 
          which the Big Four would not be allowed to bid, until the capped market share 
          levels are reached. In choosing this group of companies, it would be important 
          to make sure that the challenger firms build sufficient capacity to take up the 
          expected level of opportunities within the group. In order for conditions (a) and 
          (b) to be satisfied, the relevant groups of companies could be dynamically 
          adjusted by the regulator.  
       4.73  This option, however, would incentivise the affected companies to delay 
          tendering or to tender immediately before the cap enters into force, in order to 
          avoid facing a limited choice of audit firms. In order to satisfy condition (d), the 
          regulator should be given the power to require certain firms to re-tender 
          before the expiry of the ten-year period or to require all firms to re-tender 
          more frequently.  
       4.74  If this was the preferred design we would need to work closely with the 
          regulator to minimise the extent to which it led to a partition of the audit 
          market into one market reserved to the challenger firms and one dominated 
          by the Big Four, which could lead to a reduction of competition in the short 
          term. 
       4.75  In practice, whatever the initial design of the cap, it might be appropriate to 
          put in place a mechanism for the cap to be adjusted over time, for example 
          through an independent body for example reflecting the relative capabilities of 
          auditors over time and adjusting the cap accordingly.  
       Views of the parties 
       4.76  The Big Four were open to the introduction of a market share cap, although 
          they envisaged several issues with its practical implementation. The remedy 
          was strongly supported by other audit firms such as BDO and Mazars, the 
          latter of which suggested that it should be combined with joint audits. We 
          received mixed views from investors, but most of those we contacted 
          expressed opposition to a market share cap. The ACCs we talked to, or who 
          responded to our invitation to comment, were also generally opposed to the 
          remedy. 
                           105 
                                                                                                            
               4.77  The parties supporting the remedy submitted that a market share cap would 
                      create a platform for challenger firms to build capacity, leading to greater 
                      choice and improving the resilience of the audit market. Some parties 
                      stressed that for this to happen it would be essential that challenger firms are 
                      encouraged to be involved in the upper end of the market as well as in the 
                      other parts of it. This would require the market to be appropriately segmented 
                                               213
                      when applying the cap.       It was also suggested that the cap should be flexed 
                      over time to reflect the capability and capacity of audit firms and that a third 
                                                                                       214
                      party should be required to administer the capping process.         Finally, BDO 
                      envisaged the use of a monitoring trustee arrangement to manage an orderly 
                      divestment of clients (and staff), in order to ensure that the larger firms do not 
                                           215
                      game the changes.         
               4.78  Most of the parties who expressed a view on the introduction of a market 
                      share cap, including many of those who favour it, recognised that there would 
                      be challenges in its implementation. The views, however, differed widely on 
                      the significance of the challenges, and the extent to which they could be 
                      managed, and whether the potential benefits of the remedy could outweigh its 
                      costs. The main issues raised by the parties are set out below. 
                      (a)  In the short to medium term it is likely that the choice of auditor would be 
                           restricted for some companies if an audit firm is already at its capped limit. 
                           The reduction in choice could be particularly significant in sectors where 
                           few firms have specialist knowledge, particularly in the context of 
                           mandatory rotation and independence rules that might preclude other 
                           firms with sufficient capabilities. More generally, a market share cap could 
                           blunt incentives for audit firms to compete, leading to an overall 
                           weakening of competition, and could result in audit fees increasing or 
                           quality falling. 
                      (b)  In the short to medium term there is a risk that audit quality could decline 
                           through a lack of experience and capacity, with firms being appointed as 
                           statutory auditor that do not possess the required capabilities to address 
                           the complexities specific to individual company audits. 
                      (c)  A market share cap could compel Audit Committees to appoint an audit 
                           firm even though they may have concerns over its ability to fulfil the role 
                           effectively, blurring responsibilities and accountabilities in the process. 
                           The repercussions in the event of a subsequent audit failure would be

            difficult to manage from a reputational perspective for all the parties 
            concerned. 
          (d)  Caps could lead to firms ‘cherry picking’ clients and then refusing to 
            compete beyond that, reducing the overall level of competition. Higher-
            risk audit clients would become unattractive and would be likely to find it 
            more difficult to find an auditor. 
          (e)  The remedy might undermine the perceived credibility of the London 
            Stock Exchange to international companies if companies were forced to 
            limit the choice of auditor. Major companies might seek to move outside 
            the UK at the holding company level to preserve audit relationships that 
            the directors judge necessary for protection of shareholders’ interests. 
          (f)  There is no guarantee that over time challenger firms could gradually 
            build up capacity and quantity. It would take a lot of effort and time for 
            other audit firms to be able to pick up Big Four work. 
       Our assessment of the remedy 
       4.79  The parties’ views summarised above relate to either the short-term 
          consequences of a market share cap or to the likelihood of the desired effects 
          in the long term. These two aspects need to be assessed separately. 
       4.80  The ‘short term’ is here defined as the period when a lower market 
          concentration can only be sustained through a cap; this includes a transition 
          period, during which the caps are phased in, and the period where the audit 
          firms are operating within or at the capped levels, but the caps still constrain 
          their decisions on whether to bid for an audit contract. The ‘long term’ is 
          defined as the period in which lower concentration becomes self-sustaining. 
          The short-term impact of the remedy 
       4.81  In the short term, as more companies currently prefer a Big Four firm than 
          these firms would be allowed to serve, some of these companies would 
          experience a reduction in choice. The impact would initially occur during the 
          period when the caps are phased in, but would still be present as long as the 
          caps continued to constrain audit firms’ ability to bid. This would be expected 
          to weaken competition to some extent, potentially resulting in higher fees 
          and/or a reduction in quality. 
       4.82  Without other measures in place, weaker competition between the Big Four 
          could lead in the short term to a reduction in the quality they provide. In 
          addition, the reduction in choice might also result in a worse matching 
                           107 
                                                 
          between companies’ requirements and auditors’ expertise, with a potential 
          negative impact on audit accuracy.  
       4.83  As we describe above, smaller audit firms do not currently have the capability 
          to audit the larger, more complex companies in the FTSE 350. This is in part 
          because of the size of the audit teams required to carry out these audits and, 
          in some cases, because the challenger firms do not have the required sector 
          or other expertise. The introduction of a market share cap might therefore 
          reduce average audit quality to some extent in the short term as more 
          companies would be audited by smaller audit firms. We would expect the 
          constraints on challenger firms listed above to lessen, and likely disappear, as 
          the firms’ size grows, but this is likely to take time. 
       4.84  Some of the short-term reduction in competition discussed above is inherent 
          in any market share cap but would be more serious under some design 
          variants. One design option is to prohibit the Big Four firms from tendering for 
          some sets of companies until their market shares fall below the cap. 
          Compared to a design where the Big Four can self-select the tenders in which 
          to take part, this design is likely to lead to a greater reduction in competition. 
          The long-term impact of the remedy 
       4.85  A market share cap would certainly lead, in a relatively short time, to the 
          growth of challenger firms. In order for the remedy to be effective in 
          generating actual increased choice, however, the growth of the challenger 
          firms would need to be accompanied by a change in how they are perceived 
          by potential audit clients. We would expect this to follow over time as clients 
          and staff move from the Big Four to the challenger firms, and these firms are 
          seen as effective competitors for audits of companies throughout the FTSE 
          350. 
       4.86  As challenger firms acquire new competencies and are increasingly perceived 
          as effective competitors, the costs of the remedy, in terms of reduction in 
          choice and audit quality, would reduce, until the lower market concentration 
          becomes self-sustaining. At this point, the cap could be lifted. It would be 
          important, however, not to remove the cap too early, as the market might then 
          revert quickly to the original level of concentration. It is likely that, to achieve a 
          sustainable change in the market, the market share cap would need to be in 
          place for a number of years.  
       4.87  The positive effects on choice would be felt more quickly towards the bottom 
          of the FTSE 350 than towards the top. We would only expect a market share 
          cap to lead to an increase in choice for the most complex audits, e.g. 
          companies at the top of the FTSE 100, in the very long term. The scale and 
                           108 
                                                                                                                        
                         complexity of these audits would make it extremely challenging for any audit 
                         firm that is not part of one of the large global audit networks to acquire 
                         sufficient expertise and reputation to be appointed as sole auditor.  
                 Summary: Market share cap 
                 •   Our provisional view is that a market share cap would deliver a substantial 
                     increase in the number of challenger firms auditing the largest companies in a 
                     relatively short period of time.  
                 •   However we prefer mandatory joint audit to a market share cap as a means of 
                     breaking down barriers to non-Big Four firms competing successfully for larger 
                     audits. Both remedies would provide good market access, but joint audit would 
                     do so without the risks to short-term quality and competition presented by a 
                     market share cap.  
                 •   This remedy would initially apply at least to FTSE 350 companies. We seek 
                     views on whether it should apply to other large companies that could be in the 
                     public interest. 
                 Remedy 3: Additional measures to support challenger firms that we propose to 
                 consider further  
                 4.88  In our invitation to comment document, we asked for views on the possibility 
                         of providing direct support to challenger firms by reducing barriers to senior 
                         staff moving between firms and by sharing technology among audit firms. 
                         During our consultation, some parties also proposed the creation of a 
                         ‘tendering fund’.  
                 4.89  While these measures could reduce barriers to challenger firms, our current 
                         view is that many would be largely redundant if our proposed remedy package 
                         is implemented, but that measures to reduce barriers to staff and partner 
                         switching remain important. We briefly discuss possible measures below and 
                         welcome views on their usefulness and effectiveness.  
                 Ease of movement of staff 
                 4.90  The implementation of remedies within our proposed package is expected to 
                         lead to a significant increase in the volume of audit work undertaken by 
                         challenger firms. In this context, it will be important to ensure that challenger 
                         firms have access to the necessary human resources and, in particular, that 
                         they are able to attract senior audit staff. 
                 4.91  Many of the parties responding to our invitation to comment document 
                         submitted that there are not currently significant barriers preventing senior 
                                                                  109 
                                                                                                              
                       staff from moving between firms. KPMG told us that, other than existing notice 
                       periods, it is unclear what barriers to switching exist in practice, and whether 
                                                                              216
                       notice periods even present a barrier to switching.       PwC observed that 
                       individuals move between firms in both directions (i.e. to and from large and 
                       challenger firms), and that it is not uncommon for directors to move from a 
                                                                                 217
                       large firm to become a partner with a challenger firm.        BDO also told us that 
                       it had not faced difficulties in recruiting senior staff from the Big Four firms. 
               4.92  On the other hand, Mazars argued that, in some Big Four firms, when 
                       partners announce they are leaving the partnership, a substantial 
                       discretionary element of their remuneration is removed for the period of their 
                                                                                             218
                       notice, which can sometimes have a duration of up to two years.           This 
                       reduces the ability of challenger firms to attract such partners.  
               4.93  As noted by some parties, there are good reasons for imposing notice 
                       periods. For example, the loss of audit partners or senior audit staff members 
                       while audit work on an engagement is ongoing would be very disruptive and 
                       be a significant risk to maintaining a high-quality audit. Reducing notice 
                       periods should be approached with caution as it might impact 
                       disproportionately on the ability of smaller firms (and small offices of larger 
                       firms) to plan their workloads reliably.  
               4.94  However, these arguments do not justify the existence of unreasonable 
                       clauses that go beyond the objectives of avoiding business disruption. We will 
                       investigate this matter further and welcome any evidence to support the claim 
                       that there are significant and unreasonable barriers to senior staff switching 
                       between firms.  
               Tendering fund 
               4.95  Tendering for large audits is an expensive exercise and several parties 
                       submitted that the high costs of tendering constitutes an important barrier for 
                       challenger firms, particularly if they believe there is little chance of them being 
                                                                                  219
                       successful. Legal & General Investment Management             proposed the 
                       creation of an audit tendering fund. This would provide funding to challenger 
                       firms who meet certain criteria, allowing them to mitigate the costs of 
                       tendering and incentivising them to compete with the Big Four for large audit 
                       work.

                     4.96  The proposed remedies already outlined in this document, such as mandatory 
                               joint audit, would substantially mitigate the issue by making it more likely for 
                               challenger firms to be selected as auditor. The higher probability of being 
                               successful would give challenger firms greater incentive to sustain the cost of 
                               participating in the tendering process. This would significantly reduce the 
                               necessity of a tendering fund. 
                     Access to technology 
                     4.97  Large company tenders commonly measure the relative technological 
                               strengths of audit firms as a core part of the tender process; technology has 
                               become an increasingly important competitive parameter. The Big Four 
                               appear to have an advantage compared to the challenger firms in terms of 
                               technology platforms, methodologies and processes. The challenger firms are 
                               also investing in technology, albeit at lower absolute level.  
                     4.98  Measures to give the challenger firms access to technology could therefore, in 
                               principle, make them better able to compete for FTSE 350 audits, thereby 
                               increasing auditor choice for companies. These are two broad areas in which 
                               this could be done. 
                               (a)  Getting the challenger firms and other audit firms that wish to access 
                                      better technology to pool their resources to developing a new system; or 
                               (b)  Mandating one or more of the Big Four to either: 
                                      (i)   share their technology with the challenger firms by way of a price-
                                            controlled or commercially priced license; or 
                                      (ii)  fund the development of a new system available through an open 
                                            source platform. 
                     4.99  Some Big Four firms expressed a willingness to offer challenger firms better 
                               access to audit technology. This could take the form of open source 
                                                                               220
                               technology arrangements (EY),                        or licensing of intellectual property including 
                                                                221
                               technology (Deloitte).                However, KPMG noted that the remedy could reduce 
                               market participants’ incentives to invest and compete, thus weakening the 
                                                                                           222
                               competitive dynamics in audit services.                          
                     4.100 However, some challenger firms have indicated they did not have an interest 
                               in these measures and that their technology was state of the art. We are also

                       concerned about whether technology sharing, which would result in similar 
                       systems being used across the industry, could reduce the effectiveness of 
                       joint audits. Two different audit technology systems interrogating the audit 
                       client accounting system would more likely result in the finding of potential 
                       issues.  
               4.101 One Audit Committee Chair was supportive of this remedy on the grounds 
                       that the challenger firms currently had good staff but were lacking the support 
                       systems and processes to run a large audit. 
               4.102 Given these concerns and mixed responses from challenger firms, we are not 
                       inclined to include measures promoting technology sharing in our remedy 
                       package. We have heard that technology sharing could reduce barriers to 
                       expansion to challenger firms, and if done on fair commercial terms would 
                                                            223
                       preserve the incentive to innovate.      Therefore, we encourage the industry to 
                       consider technology sharing further, but we are not provisionally making 
                       recommendations on this measure.  
                Summary: Additional measures to reduce barriers to challenger firms 
                We favour the prohibition or limits on the length of non-compete clauses as these 
                make it harder for audit partners and staff to switch firms. Partner switching is 
                necessary for challenger firms to build their capacity. 
                A number of other measures such as technology sharing warrant further 
                consideration. 
                
               Remedy 4: Market resilience 
               Introduction 
               4.103 Audit plays a vital role in the functioning of capital markets, and other 
                       important areas of the modern economy such as credit ratings, borrowing 
                       assessments and taxation amongst others. In sectors such as banking and 
                       care homes, the regulator monitors the financial health of the sector, and the 
                       banking and retail energy sectors also have special insolvency regimes.  
               4.104 These regimes can have several objectives but generally address either: 
                       (a)  ensuring continuity of supply of the service for customers; or  
                
                
               223
                  KPMG’s submission to the ITC, page 24.  
                                                            112 
                                                                                                                      
                        (b)  maintaining the integrity of the market, for example because there are a 
                             limited number of suppliers. 
                4.105 There is no similar regime for the audit market. We understand that the 
                        Companies Act may help ensure continuity of supply to some extent but that it 
                        would not address concerns over the integrity of the market. Hence, the 
                        demise of a Big Four firm could lead to the ‘Big Three’.  
                4.106 The UK insolvency framework, which currently applies to audit, places a 
                        greater emphasis on the maximisation of distributions to creditors (and then 
                        shareholders) over preserving the firm and ensuring the resilience of the 
                        market. 
                4.107 This remedy would create a market oversight and resilience regime in the 
                        event of a likely or actual failure of a large audit firm in the UK. It would ensure 
                        that there remains adequate choice of auditors in the market, while 
                        maintaining competition and quality both on its own and as part of a package 
                        of remedies. 
                Aim of the remedy 
                4.108 In light of resilience issues, discussed above, this remedy would seek to 
                        protect against the negative effects of further concentration in the audit market 
                        and avoid what might otherwise be the most likely outcome: the Big Four 
                        becoming the Big Three. This remedy would aid in maintaining choice and 
                        increasing the resilience of the market. 
                Design and implementation of the remedy 
                4.109 At its core, the remedy would aim to ensure that the audit clients of a failing 
                        Big Four firm are not transferred to another Big Four audit firm. The assets 
                        (including staff) are likely to follow the audit clients.  
                4.110 Designing the remedy would be complex. There are a number of issues that 
                        would need to be worked through. 
                        (a)  Identifying what the regulator should do if partners and clients of a 
                             distressed firm start leaving for another Big Four firm long before the firm 
                                                    224
                             files for insolvency.      Our current view is that the regulator should keep 
                             the market under review and take steps to prevent further concentration 
                             by:  
                 
                 
                224
                    For example, a situation similar to that experienced by Arthur Andersen in 2001 - 2002. 
                                                                 113 
                                                                                                                                                       
                                      (i)   incentivising and/or mandating the movement of audit clients (and 
                                            staff) to challenger firms. This could work if significant member firms 
                                            in another large national market were at risk; and 
                                      (ii)  incentivising and/or mandating that audit clients (and staff) of a 
                                            distressed audit firm remain within the firm while a special 
                                            administrator attempts a turnaround of the firm. This could work if the 
                                            problem were isolated to the UK member firm or only a few small 
                                            member firms.  
                               (b)  Preventing moral hazard (excessive risk taking in the expectation of a 
                                      ‘bail-out’), while incentivising the partners and key staff to remain with the 
                                      existing firm or move to a challenger firm. Our current view is that the 
                                      equity within the firm relating to all (audit and non-audit) partners could be 
                                      ringfenced with partner drawings coming under regulatory review. This 
                                      could be used to pay the fees of the regulator and/or special 
                                      administrator. A distribution to the equity partners could only be made if 
                                      the turnaround was successful. A similar incentive could also be used to 
                                      transfer staff (especially partners) of a distressed or failing firm to a non-
                                                          225
                                      Big Four firm.            
                               (c)  Identifying what powers the regulator and/or special administrator require, 
                                      how their roles should be divided, and at what point one or other should 
                                      be able to exercise executive control over a firm. This process is made 
                                      more complex as an audit firm’s value lies in its people and clients. Our 
                                      current view is that the regulator would be well placed to keep the market 
                                      under review and take steps to incentivise staff and clients not to transfer 
                                      to a Big Four firm or to remain within the same firm (see above). If the firm 
                                      did not respond to these incentives and it were heading towards failure in 
                                      the short to medium term, the regulator could appoint a special 
                                      administrator, who could take executive control over the failing firm. 
                     4.111 Careful consideration should be given to develop a workable regime, and we 
                               are seeking feedback on how such a system could be designed. Examples 
                               from other sectors may provide a useful starting point, for example, ‘living 
                               wills’ as implemented by financial institutions in the US, the Bank of England’s 
                               ‘resolution’ regime, or a special administration regime similar to those 
                               applying in certain regulated industries in the UK.  
                      
                      
                     225
                         The counterfactual to this remedy would most likely be the failure of the firm, along with any reduction in the 
                     value of equity within the business. 
                                                                                   114 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                             Summary: Resilience regime 
                                                                             This remedy warrants further consideration and we welcome parties’ views on how 
                                                                             an effective resilience regime could be designed to avoid going from the Big Four to 
                                                                             the Big Three.

                                                                             some large challenger firms to come within scope as they grow in relative size.

                                                                            4.112 Various rules already exist to limit the effect of conflicts caused by the audit 
                                                                                                                 firms’ combined audit / non-audit structures. The EU Audit regulation imposed 
                                                                                                                 significant restrictions on the provision of non-audit services to audit clients. It

            former is to be sceptical, and the key objective of the latter is typically to 
            be collaborative (see above). 
          (d)  Even when non-audit services are wound down in anticipation of 
            accepting the audit engagement, independence and challenge could be 
            affected by cultural considerations, for example, if the audit firm and the 
            client have a history of working collaboratively in an advisory relationship. 
            There may also be a risk that the selection process is not truly non-
            discriminatory where the audit firm and the company have a close non-
            audit services working relationship.  
       4.114 One way to address the reality and perception of non-audit service related 
          conflicts would be to structurally separate audit and non-audit services. This 
          would comprehensively address the issues set out above. Depending on the 
          specific implementation, it might allow relaxation of the conflicts rules and 
          therefore a return to greater choice among the Big Four. However, there are 
          important practical challenges in creating audit-only firms, notably related to 
          the international networks to which these firms are a part, and the use of non-
          audit experts on audits. There would also likely be substantial costs and 
          disruption to the firms.  
       4.115 Therefore, we are also considering other variants of this remedy that could be 
          effective, but less costly, in addressing our concerns with respect to non-audit 
          services conflicts. One possible solution might be for firms to implement an 
          operational split between the audit and non-audit parts of the firm, with 
          separate profit pools and governance arrangements for audit and non-audit. 
          We want to test whether an operational split could be designed in a way that 
          would make it almost as effective as full structural separation in addressing 
          our concerns about multidisciplinary firms (see above).  
       Aims of the remedy 
       4.116 The objectives of a remedy seeking to restrict the provision of non-audit 
          services by audit firms are to address:  
          (a)  the negative effects on the culture of the audit practice (at a firm level) 
            that can result from being part of a multidisciplinary professional services 
            firm with a non-audit practice. The creation of audit-only firms would help 
            enhance a culture of independence and professional scepticism; and  
          (b)  the lack of choice (at an engagement level) that can arise as a result of 
            audit firms being conflicted from tendering because of the provision of 
            non-audit services to potential audit clients.  
                           116 
                                                 
       Design and implementation of the remedy 
       4.117 Full structural separation of the audit and non-audit parts of the business 
          would ideally be implemented in the following way:  
          (a)  any audit firm over a certain size threshold would be prohibited from 
            providing non-audit services in the UK;  
          (b)  the UK audit firm would then become a stand-alone firm, but could remain 
            part of a multidisciplinary international network provided there was no 
            common ownership and no financial subsidies from the international 
            network to the UK audit firm; 
          (c)  this prohibition on non-audit services provision in the UK and to UK 
            companies would apply to the overseas network of the UK audit firm so 
            that no members of the network could provide these services in the UK. 
            Likewise, an overseas member firm would also be prohibited from 
            auditing such UK companies if it were part of a network that provided non-
            audit services in the UK; 
          (d)  the member firms would be prohibited from providing non-audit services 
            to any group company of their UK based audit clients; this restriction 
            could for example apply to FTSE 350 audit clients; and 
          (e)  audit-only firms would need to replicate in-house the non-audit expertise 
            required to support an audit (for example, by recruiting non-audit 
            specialists to work on audit engagements), or contract externally from an 
            independent non-audit practice.  
       4.118 An operational split, by contrast, would allow for an ongoing relationship 
          between the audit and non-audit parts of the UK firm, particularly allowing for 
          the sharing of expertise and systems. The key features of an operational split 
          might include: 
          (a)  separation of the audit and non-audit businesses, with the audit business 
            having a separate board, chief executive, staff and assets;  
          (b)  separate profit and pension pools for the audit and non-audit entities; 
          (c)  restrictions on audit partners (but not staff) moving between audit and 
            non-audit businesses of the same firm; 
          (d)  transfer pricing arrangements between the two entities, for example to 
            support use of non-audit staff on audits; and 
                           117 
                                                                                                               
                       (e)  both the audit and non-audit businesses could share some central 
                            operations, systems, branding and know-how, and both would remain part 
                            of the same multidisciplinary network. 
                4.119 For both structural and operational splits, the audit practice would also be 
                       permitted to provide services closely related to statutory audits (such as 
                       quarterly or half yearly reviews). 
                Views of the parties – full structural split 
                4.120 We have heard several arguments in support of full separation of audit and 
                       non-audit firms. For example, Sarasin submitted that the creation of audit-only 
                       firms would address culture and choice concerns. 
                       (a)  ‘Auditors need to adopt a sceptical mind-set and be comfortable 
                            challenging management. This is a very different relationship to one 
                            adopted by consultant to management. Where audit firms are undertaking 
                            both audit and consulting work, they will always struggle to reconcile 
                            these competing models. The creation of pure audit firms would eliminate 
                                          229
                            this tension’.    
                       (b)  ‘[A]n advantage of pure audit would be an immediate increase in the 
                            number of firms competing for audit business today since none would be 
                                                             230
                            ruled out on conflict grounds’.      
                4.121 We also heard views that, while a structural split would be complex, the 
                       challenges could be addressed. 
                       (a)  A number of parties told us that obstacles related to the international 
                            aspect of audit networks would be surmountable. ACCA, while not 
                            supporting the audit-only firm remedy, said that it ‘do[es] not see that the 
                            international affiliations of member firms would constrain the creation of 
                                              231
                            audit only firms’.    The LAPFF said that given ‘firms tend to have an 
                            affiliate relationship, rather than common international ownership, then 
                                                                                                      232
                            audit only firms in one jurisdiction doesn’t seem to create barriers’.        
                       (b)  One ACC told us that access to non-audit expertise on audits would also 
                            not present an insurmountable challenge, as audit-only firms could hire in-

                                      terms.  
                     4.122 However, audit firms (the Big Four, challenger firms and others), company 
                               management (e.g. 100 Group), several large companies, industry 
                               (professional) bodies, Audit Committees, investors (institutional investors and 
                               investment managers) and other stakeholders were generally opposed to the 
                               proposal to create audit-only firms. The key objections raised are listed below. 
                               (a)  The international nature of audit networks makes the remedy impractical 
                                      on a UK-only basis. Some parties submitted that both audit and non-audit 
                                      businesses needed to remain part of the international network. Others told 
                                      us that preventing international multidisciplinary firms from having a non-
                                                                                                                     
                                      audit presence in the UK would be disproportionate.  
                               (b)  Audit quality would suffer as audit-only firms would not have ready access 
                                      to non-audit experts to support an audit.  
                                      (i)   Parties told us that it would not be feasible or desirable to maintain all 
                                            of the required non-audit expertise in-house. We heard that the range 
                                            of specialists required could not all be maintained in an audit-only firm 
                                            on a full-time basis, and those that were would not keep their skills 
                                            sharp by practising outside the audit sphere.  
                                      (ii)  With respect to obtaining non-audit expertise from outside the firm, 
                                            we heard that challenges include ensuring that third-party advisers 
                                            meet the necessary independence requirement, ensuring that advice 
                                            can be obtained in a timely fashion, and risks associated with liability 
                                            – all of which would likely affect the willingness of third-parties to 
                                            provide these services on satisfactory terms.  
                                      (iii)  Parties told us that either option risked a reduction in audit quality. 
                                            Some parties also raised concerns that UK audit-only firms would 
                                            reduce the UK’s status as a leading audit jurisdiction – risking large 
                                            and sophisticated companies taking steps to have their audits 
                                            performed by non-UK auditors. 
                               (c)  Audit-only firms might struggle to recruit the best and brightest talent 
                                      without the ability to offer a range of work experience and varied career 
                                      pathways. We were told this would lead to a reduction in audit quality.  
                               (d)  The separation of audit and non-audit business would have a 
                                      disproportionately detrimental impact on challenger firms. In particular, 
                                      challenger firms would lose an avenue through which they can gain 
                                                                                   119 
                                                                                                             
                           experience in a particular sector, further raising barriers to undertaking 
                           large audits in sectors where they have no prior audit experience.  
                       (e)  Audit-only firms would be more financially dependent on their large audit 
                           clients, risking an adverse impact on the incentives to challenge 
                           management. Some parties said this would be more acute for challenger 
                           firms than the Big Four.  
                       (f)  Audit-only firms would have less scale for investment and would be less 
                           resilient and able to withstand market shocks. Some challenger firms told 
                           us that the lack of scale would also disproportionately affect them.  
               4.123 Some parties, including the major audit firms, have suggested that the CMA’s 
                       concerns about the effect of non-audit services on the provision of audits 
                       would be better served by a ban on the provision of non-audit services to 
                       audit clients. We also heard that regulation such as the ‘70% rule’, the ban on 
                       certain non-audit services to audit clients and the prohibition against cross-
                       selling deal with non-audit services address independence concerns and that 
                       the CMA should give these measures time to take effect and then assess their 
                       impact before implementing new remedies. 
               Views of the parties – operational split 
               4.124 An operational split remedy was not expressly referred to in our invitation to 
                       comment document, though some stakeholders suggested this could be a 
                       more practical and proportionate alternative to a full structural split.  
               4.125 Others said that ring-fencing would be challenging. For example, Grant 
                       Thornton, said that ‘ring-fencing of the audit business [would be] challenging 
                       to implement and monitor, as well as being a weak response to the concern 
                       around conflicts; one that is also unlikely to mitigate the perception of 
                                233
                       conflict’.   
               Our assessment of full structural split and operational split 
               4.126 A complete split would address real and perceived concerns relating to 
                       culture. It would also have a positive impact on choice as firms would no 
                       longer be conflicted due to the provision of non-audit services in the UK. 
               4.127 Some of the objections to full separation are overstated.  
                
                
               233
                  Grant Thornton’s submission to the ITC, page 15. 
                                                            120 
                                                                                                          
                      (a)  We are unconvinced that recruitment would be a major obstacle. Audit-
                          only firms could continue to provide an attractive professional grounding 
                          for many graduates who may ultimately pursue a career in a related 
                          discipline; the only difference being they would now do so in a different 
                          firm, rather than merely a different team. Furthermore, the evidence that 
                                        234
                          the Big Four     and the challenger firms submitted to us, ranging from 
                          2011 to 2018, suggests that the number of audit staff that permanently 
                          moved into or seconded into a non-audit team within their firms is 
                          relatively low compared to the total number of either audit staff or 
                          graduates. 
                      (b)  Firms could mitigate the challenges in obtaining non-audit expertise. For 
                          example, non-audit firms could be held on retainer (perhaps covering a 
                          number of years), allowing access to advice at short notice. Although the 
                          large audit firms rely on a material amount of non-audit specialist input, 
                          the non-audit partner time on an audit is low – accounting for less than 
                                                                  235
                          1% of the all hours spent on an audit.      In the event of a separation we 
                          would expect that audit firms would be able to contract for those non-audit 
                          services they were unable to deliver in-house.  
                      (c)  Although audit-only firms would be smaller in scale, they would remain 
                          profitable and be capable of making necessary investments. Our analysis 
                          shows that the EBIT margins are positive for the audit parts of the 
                          business. 
               4.128 However, implementing audit-only firms would carry costs for the audit firms 
                      and there are risks of unintended consequences.  
                      (a)  The lack of non-audit expertise from within the multidisciplinary firm could 
                          have a detrimental effect on efficiency and potentially quality. Audit firms 
                          rely on expert input of non-audit specialists for approximately 10% - 20% 
                          of a FTSE 350 audit, which is a material amount of expertise to outsource 
                          or retain within an audit-only firm. However, these risks to quality and 
                          efficiency could be mitigated, e.g. through running competitive tenders for 
                          non-audit services support, and keeping firms on retainers.  
                      (b)  The remedy might see international networks break away from the UK 
                          audit arm and retain the non-audit services business. This could have a 
                          detrimental impact on the quality and standing of the UK audit profession 
                
                
               234
                  This analysis excludes KPMG, which did not submit the required information. 
               235
                  Based upon CMA analysis of data submitted by audit firms, showing the hours worked by audit and non-audit 
               staff on over 2,000 audit engagements carried out for FTSE350 and PIE companies between 2011 and 2018.  
                                                          121 
                                                                                                          
                          if the UK audit market becomes less attractive or if UK companies are 
                          serviced by audit firms based outside the UK.   
                      (c)  The remedy would be likely to have detrimental effects on all audit firms 
                          within its scope, and smaller firms may be less able to source in-house 
                          the same level of expertise as the Big Four. However if the remedy was 
                          limited to the Big Four, this would give a substantial advantage to 
                          challenger firms. 
               4.129 As an alternative, an operational split could have the following merits. 
                      (a)  Separate profit pools and governance arrangements would be a 
                          significant step to addressing independence concerns, because audit 
                          partners’ individual financial success would be purely driven by the audit 
                          business – but this would not completely negate the culture issues 
                          discussed above. 
                      (b)  Many of the key costs and risks associated with full structural split could 
                          be avoided – in particular, audit firms could continue to have access to 
                          non-audit expertise from their non-audit service counterpart, and 
                                                                                        236
                          international networks would in most cases be unaffected.          
                      (c)  Depending on design, an operational split has potential to release audit 
                          firms from the application of certain conflict regulations, which could 
                          increase choice (see below).  
               4.130 If the operational split was implemented in such a way that it effectively 
                      addressed the conflicts between audit and non-audit then we would expect 
                      that the separate audit firms could be relieved from at least parts of the 
                      existing conflict rules (for example the 70% rule).  
               4.131 This measure would increase choice and competition at the time of tendering. 
                      We would expect our proposed package of measures (and in particular the 
                      joint audit remedy) to improve the ability of challenger firms to win the largest 
                      audits, so that removing the conflict rules from the Big Four would not lead to 
                      greater concentration in the market. 
               4.132 However, compared to full structural split, an operational split would likely be 
                      more complex to implement in such a way that it meets our objectives, 
                      remains effective and that the remedy is not circumvented. For example, the 
                      remedy would require stringent regulatory oversight of separation 
                      arrangements, such as a robust transfer-pricing and information-sharing 
                
                
               236
                  Some firms operate a global profit sharing mechanism which would need to be considered as part of this 
               remedy. 
                                                          122 
                                                 
          policy to keep the profit pools separate. Hence, this remedy carries risks of 
          circumvention. 
       4.133 There are also some potential practical challenges around how operationally 
          split firms would manage their conflicts, to the extent that some conflict rules 
          would continue to apply (for example, the EU Audit Regulation restrictions on 
          ‘blacklisted’ services apply at the network level, rather than the firm level).  
       4.134 Our provisional view is that the challenges to implement a form of operational 
          split are manageable, and we welcome views on whether this is the case. 
          (a)  The new structure could enable sufficient interaction between the audit 
            and non-audit businesses for the audit business to access specialist 
            support on request, as is the case currently and as considered necessary 
            to perform effective audits. While the services will need to be provided on 
            third-party terms and prices, the terms could include ongoing support on 
            an audit, rather than a specific piece of advice. We welcome views on 
            how this could be achieved in such a way as not to reintroduce conflicts. 
          (b)  An audit-only firm would be prohibited from sharing its systems, and 
            providing back-office support, training and know-how to the non-audit 
            business and vice versa. However, the operational split remedy would 
            allow access to these shared services, subject to appropriate transfer 
            pricing and cost allocations. 
          (c)  It appears to us that, although it would be complex, it would be possible to 
            segregate existing defined benefit pension schemes for the few staff that 
            are on such schemes. Part of the scheme deficit may need to be funded 
            upfront, depending on the magnitude of assets taken out of the existing 
            scheme. The technical details of the pension scheme split across the 
            entities could be overseen by the Pensions Regulator in conjunction with 
            the audit regulator. 
       4.135 If in time it proves impossible to design and implement an operational split 
          that achieves a sufficiently large part of the benefits of a structural split – for 
          instance if firms game it, or if it proves impossible to overcome the cultural 
          cohesion of the two parts of each firm – the option of pursuing the full 
          structural split may need to be revisited, at least for the Big Four.  
       Further restrictions on non-audit services to audit clients 
       4.136 We prefer either full structural split, or an operational split, to further 
          restrictions of non-audit services to clients because of the impact further 
          restrictions could have on choice. 
                           123 
                                                 
       4.137 This reduction in choice would not only impact choice among the Big Four, but 
          would also either exclude Challenger firms from many selection processes or 
          require them to stop providing non-audit services to large clients (see above 
          for the level of non-audit services provided by Challenger firms to FTSE 350 
          companies). One of our key objectives is to reduce barriers to Challenger 
          firms – therefore, a restriction on non-audit services that would exclude 
          Challenger firms from audit tender processes runs counter to our objectives.  
       Summary: Full structural or operational split between audit and non-audit 
       services 
       Full separation would be an effective remedy. Nevertheless, we seek responses 
       from parties on whether and how an operational split could be equally effective in 
       addressing our objectives. 
       Either form of separation – full structural or an operational split – should apply to at 
       least the Big Four. We seek views as to whether this remedy should also apply to 
       challenger firms as well.  
       Remedy 6: Peer review 
       Introduction 
       4.138 We set out in the previous section the importance of a regulatory regime that 
          sets minimum standards, makes visible the differences in quality between 
          firms and then holds firms to account for any underperformance.  
       4.139 We propose that an important element of the regulator’s toolkit should be a 
          peer reviewer who is able to identify underperformance as it happens and 
          whose presence may actually stop any underperformance occurring. The peer 
          reviewer should be independent, appointed and paid by the regulator, and 
          owe a duty of care only to the regulator.  
       Aim of the remedy 
       4.140 The key objective of this remedy would be to improve audit quality by 
          introducing an additional, independent quality check. 
       Design and implementation of the remedy 
       4.141 The peer review firm would be a third party – not connected to the statutory 
          auditor and not having recently audited the company. The peer review could 
          be carried out on all companies, a random selection, or specific companies 
                           124 
                                                 
          that raise particular risks. It could involve shadowing the statutory auditor on 
          certain aspects of the audit.  
       4.142 To enhance independence, the peer reviewer should be appointed by the 
          regulator. The regulator would have certain duties and objectives including to 
          promote competition, in selecting its choice of the peer reviewer. This remedy 
          could be funded by a levy on the audit fees of the FTSE 350 and large 
          companies, and the sector regulator would then pay the fees of the peer 
          reviewer using the proceeds of the levy. 
       4.143 The regulator would determine which companies were subject to a peer 
          review. This could be focused on higher risk companies, or those which 
          required additional scrutiny (for example because they were initially outside 
          the scope of joint audit), or allocated at random.  
       4.144 The peer reviewer would: 
          (a)  review the audit file, processes and conduct financial analytical reviews; 
          (b)  re-perform audit tests on material and risky audit areas, which would be 
            its area of focus; 
          (c)  be incentivised to identify any weaknesses that exist in the audit. The 
            incentives for peer reviewers with a proven track record of high quality 
            reviews could be a greater allocation of peer reviews by the sector 
            regulator and/or financial rewards; 
          (d)  submit its report to the Audit Committee and the sector regulator; and 
          (e)  have its report used by the Audit Committee to challenge the auditors and 
            management before the accounts are signed off. 
       4.145 As a result, statutory auditors would be incentivised to ‘remain on their toes’, 
          which should increase their professional scepticism and audit quality. 
       Views of the parties 
       4.146 Our invitation to comment did not make it explicit that a peer reviewer would 
          be appointed by an independent regulator. It is therefore plausible that parties 
          commenting on this remedy could have assumed that the appointment would 
          be made by a company’s Audit Committee. 
       4.147 Some audit firms and other stakeholders supported peer reviews, insofar as it 
          would be a substitute for joint audits. For example, KPMG submitted that it 
                           125 
                                                                                                              
                       was not in principle opposed to exploring possibilities in relation to some form 
                                                                 237
                       of peer review, rather than joint audits.     
               4.148 Some stakeholders supported the principles underpinning peer reviews on the 
                       grounds that it could help the challenger firms gain exposure or increase audit 
                       quality. For example, Santander told us that a peer review would be a 
                       preferable alternative to the introduction of joint or shared audits and could 
                       develop greater market access for the challenger firms to the largest audit 
                       clients, but that there would however be potential time and incremental cost 
                       constraints of this. USS told us that that peer reviews of the sections audited 
                                                                                                238
                       by each firm in the case of a joint audit could improve audit quality.        
               4.149 However, parties highlighted several practical challenges with the 
                                                                                                      239
                       implementation of a peer review remedy. Chartered Accountants Ireland              
                       submitted that peer review would:  
                       (a)  lead to significant cost increases due to duplication of work; 
                       (b)  create challenges in establishing the sharing of responsibility and liability 
                           between primary auditor and reviewer; 
                       (c)  require arrangements to be put in place for dealing with material 
                           disagreements between the primary auditor and the reviewer, and the 
                           reporting thereof;and 
                       (d)  create independence issues in future tender processes for the reviewing 
                           firm and further limit the choice of statutory audit for the reporting entity. 
               4.150 Similarly, Deloitte submitted that the complexities in determining the scope of 
                       the peer review and the liability levels for both audit firms, together with the 
                       likelihood that a peer review will lengthen the audit process, would make the 
                                                                   240
                       remedy less effective than shared audit.        
               4.151 Finally, BDO told us that shadowing could be more effective than peer review 
                       if peer review merely took the form of reviewing the audit files. It said that 
                       such a peer review would create incentives for audit files to be well 
                       documented and would prevent inaccuracies, but this would not by itself 
                       produce good quality audits. BDO argued that the statutory auditor having

                                                            126 
                                                 
          applied suitable scepticism was not necessarily captured through a peer 
          review, whereas it could be through shadowing. 
       Our assessment of the remedy 
       4.152 Peer reviews of the overall financials (for example, the consolidated accounts) 
          coupled with shadow audits of risky areas would be effective in keeping the 
          statutory auditors ‘on their toes’. They would do so by being performed by an 
          ‘outsider’ – the peer reviewer would be appointed and paid by an external 
          body and would thus be less susceptible to forming the cosy relationship that 
          we have been told can develop between the Audit Committee, executive 
          management and the statutory auditors. The peer reviewer would be 
          expected to challenge this relationship, thereby addressing the risk that a 
          single or joint auditor could be conflicted and as a result be incentivised not to 
          identify the matters that they should. 
       4.153 A peer reviewer incentivised to find issues could result in inefficiencies, even 
          on high quality audits. For example, the peer reviewer could pointlessly try 
          and identify flaws with audit areas that by their nature will always require a 
          certain amount of judgement. This could create uncertainty regarding the 
          status of the audit opinion, leading to delays in the sign off and/or confusion 
          around the status of the financial statements. However, a well-designed peer 
          review system that focused on key audit areas could avoid significant 
          inefficiencies. 
       4.154 This remedy would create an additional layer of activity, whereby first the work 
          of management would be checked by the auditor, then the work of the auditor 
          would be checked by the external peer reviewer (in addition to internal 
          reviews), and finally the work of both would then be checked by the FRC as 
          part of its AQR procedures. However, the levels of duplication would be 
          minimal, as the focus of the peer review would only be on the key audit areas 
          and, unlike AQR procedures, it would occur prior to the signing-off of the 
          accounts. This system of checks and balances has the potential to increase 
          audit quality. 
       4.155 However, peer reviews would not by themselves give challenger firms enough 
          experience to become more competitive in tendering for the audits of large 
          companies. This is because the role of the peer reviewer would be relatively 
          minor compared to that of the statutory auditor, and would not give the same 
          exposure to company boards as joint audit. We do not therefore consider peer 
          review an effective way to improve choice and resilience.

                                                                             The regulator should have the ability to determine the scope of the peer review 
                                                                             function, perhaps initially targeting this at companies that it considers high risk or

                                                                            4.156 We consulted on some remedies in the invitation to comment document that 
                                                                                                                 we do not intend to pursue further. These remedies include: 
                                                                                                                 (a)  breaking the Big Four into smaller audit firms; 
                                                                                                                 (b)  introducing an insurance-based system; 
                                                                                                                 (c)  creating an NAO-style auditor for private sector audits; 
                                                                                                                 (d)  further changes to the frequency of auditor tendering or rotation; and 
                                                                                                                 (e)  changes to restrictions on ownership of audit firms.

                                                                                                                 implementing these remedies. Subsequently, we reviewed the parties’ 
                                                                                                                 submissions. In general stakeholders who responded to our document did not

                                                                                                                                                              should be accompanied by a proportionate liability regime, in order to 
                                                                                                                                                              incentivise challenger firms to take on the highest risk audits. We 
                                                                                                                                                              have not reached any decision on the merits of that proposal, but 
                                                                                                                                                              such reform would clearly be well beyond the scope of the CMA’s 
                                                                                                                                                              order making powers.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             129 
                                                                                                                                                       
                                      (iii)  The audit legal framework is complex – a combination of EU 
                                            directives and regulation and UK legislation, regulations, codes and 
                                            the existing CC orders. Our proposed remedies would be most 
                                            effectively implemented, monitored and enforced if enacted in the 
                                            clearest possible way within the wider framework, rather than as a 
                                            bolt-on via the order-making route. 
                               (b)  Legislation would enable a broader set of remedies. The CMA’s remit 
                                      is to address competition concerns. In a market investigation our specific 
                                      responsibility is to identify and address any adverse effects on 
                                      competition. As set out in section three, our view is that the market is not 
                                      currently delivering consistent high-quality audits, and that appears to be 
                                      attributable to a number of competition issues. However, we are also 
                                      mindful that audit quality is strongly affected by regulation. To the extent 
                                      we ultimately favoured remedies outside our competition mandate, we 
                                      may not have the power to implement them by order. Government, by 
                                      contrast, can take much broader policy considerations into account.  
                               (c)  Government has an opportunity to consider all market features and 
                                      potential reforms in parallel. 
                                      (i)   The CMA’s proposals are unlikely to be implemented in isolation. Our 
                                            work takes place alongside Sir John Kingman’s recommendations, 
                                            and any recommendations from the expected review on the purpose 
                                            and scope of audits. These all need to be implemented together to 
                                            have the best chance of addressing the intractable problems in the 
                                            market.  
                                      (ii)  Similarly, we are in the unusual position of undertaking a market 
                                            study at a time when the relevant sector regulator is also under 
                                            review, with the potential for fundamental changes to the regulator 
                                            and regulatory structure as a result. As a practical matter therefore, it 
                                            would likely be challenging for the CMA to make specific orders when 
                                            the regulatory framework is in flux, and the outcome of the regulatory 
                                            review is beyond our control.  
                     5.4       We could refer this market for a market investigation, with the potential for 
                               orders at its conclusion. At least one response to our ITC suggested that we 
                               should indeed make a market investigation reference. At this stage, however, 
                               and as a proposal for consultation, we are minded not to make a market 
                                                                                   130 
                                                                                                        
                      investigation reference, because we see recommendations to the government 
                                                                   241
                      as a more effective route to implementation.     
               5.5    Our consultation will run until 21 January. We will continue to gather evidence, 
                      meet with stakeholders and undertake analysis with a view to refining our 
                      proposed remedies and issuing a final report as soon as possible in 2019. 
                
                
               241
                  The CMA’s guidance makes clear that, in considering whether or not to make a reference, the CMA will take 
               into account the likely availability of appropriate remedies in the event that the suspected adverse effects on 
               competition were found to exist. In particular, the CMA guidance states it will have regard to whether any adverse 
               effects on competition can be addressed by the CMA in circumstances where those effects arise primarily from 
               laws, regulations, or government policies. 
                                                         131 
                                                                                          
             6.    Responding to the update paper  
             6.1   We welcome submissions on any of the issues we address in this update 
                   paper by no later than 5pm on 21 January 2019. We particularly welcome 
                   responses to the questions in Box 6.1 below. Respondents are welcome to 
                   address some or all of these questions. 
              Box 6.1: Consultation questions  
               
              A) Issues  
                 1.  Do you agree with our analysis in section two of the concerns about audit 
                    quality?  
                 2.  Do you agree with our analysis of the issues that are driving quality 
                    concerns, as set out in section three? In particular:  
                       a.  Issues relating to the role of Audit Committees and investors in the 
                          process of appointing and monitoring auditors; 
                       b.  Limitations on choice leading to weaker competition; 
                       c.  Barriers to challenger firms for FTSE 350 audits;  
                       d.  Resilience concerns; and 
                       e.  Wider incentive issues raised by the multi-disciplinary nature of the 
                          large audit firms. 
              B) Remedies 
                
              For all remedies: 
                 3.  What should the scope of each remedy be? Please explain your reasoning. 
                    For example, should each remedy apply to all FTSE 350 companies, or be 
                    expanded to include PIEs or large privately-owned companies that could be 
                    deemed to be in the public interest? 
               
              Remedy 1: Regulatory scrutiny of Audit Committees 
                 4.  How could the regulatory scrutiny remedy be best designed to ensure that 
                    the requirements placed on Audit Committees by a regulator are concrete, 
                    measurable and able to hold Audit Committees to account? Please respond 
                    in relation to requirements both during the tender selection process and 
                    during the audit engagement. 
               
              Remedy 2: Mandatory joint audit 
                                                 132 
                                                 
         5.  What should the scope of this remedy be? Please explain your reasoning.  
           a) Should the requirement to have a joint audit apply to all FTSE 350 
           companies or potentially go wider by including large private companies? 
           b) What types of companies (if any) should be excluded from a requirement 
           for joint audit?  
         6.  Should one of the joint auditors be required to be a challenger firm? If so, 
           should this be required for all companies subject to joint audit? Are there any 
           categories of companies to which this requirement should not apply? Please 
           explain your reasoning for each of the answers. 
         7.  Should a minimum amount of work (and fee) allocated to each joint auditor 
           be set by a regulator? If so, should the same splits apply across the FTSE 
           350? (please comment on the illustrative examples in section four). Please 
           explain your reasoning. 
         8.  Our provisional view is that there would be merit in the joint auditors being 
           appointed at different times. Should this be mandated, or left to the choice of 
           individual companies? How should companies manage (or be mandated to 
           manage) the transition from a single auditor to joint auditors? 
         9.  Should a joint liability framework be introduced to encourage active 
           participation in the market by the Big Four and challenger firms? Please 
           explain your reasoning. In the context of joint audits, what are the 
           advantages or disadvantages of auditor liability being proportionate to the 
           audit fee of the joint auditors, compared to the auditors being jointly and 
           severally liable? 
         
        Remedy 2A: Market share cap 
         10. How could the risks associated with a market share cap, such as cherry-
           picking, be addressed? 
         11. Would it need to apply only to FTSE 350 companies, or also to other large 
           companies, and if so, which?  
          
        Remedy 3: Additional measures to reduce barriers for challenger firms 
         12. We welcome evidence from stakeholders on the existence of barriers to 
           senior staff (including partners) switching quickly and smoothly between 
           firms. We also welcome views on how justified such barriers are, bearing in 
           mind commercial considerations that audit firms have. 
                           133 
                                                 
         13. We welcome estimates on the costs of setting up and running a tendering 
           fund or equivalent subsidy scheme, and views as to how this should be 
           designed. 
         14. We welcome comments as to whether the Big Four should be compelled to 
           license their technology platforms at a reasonable cost to the challenger 
           firms, and/or contribute resources (financial, technical, algorithms and data 
           to enable machine learning) towards developing an open-source platform. In 
           the first scenario, we also welcome comments on how such a ‘reasonable 
           cost’ might be determined in such a way that it is affordable for challenger 
           firms but does not disincentivise Big Four firms from innovating and 
           developing new platforms.  
            
        Remedy 4: Market resilience 
         15. How could a resilience system be designed to prevent the Big Four 
           becoming the Big Three, not just in the case of a sudden event, but also in 
           the case of a gradual decline? Please also comment on our initial views to 
           disincentivise and/or prohibit the movement of audit clients (and staff) to 
           another Big Four firm. 
         16. How could such a system prevent moral hazard? Please comment on our 
           initial view. 
         17. What powers would a regulator and a special administrator require, and how 
           would their roles be divided? At what point should a regulator or a special 
           administrator be able to exercise executive control over a distressed firm? 
           Please comment on our initial view. 
         18. What could be done regarding the challenges relating to the fact that an 
           audit firm’s value lies in its people and clients – which would be complicated 
           to restrict? Please comment on our initial view. 
          
        Remedy 5: Full structural or operational split 
         19. Do you agree with the view that the challenges to implement a full structural 
           split are surmountable (especially relating to the international networks)? If 
           not, please explain why it would be unachievable, i.e. that the barriers to 
           implement this remedy could never be overcome, including through a 
           legislative process. 
                           134 
                                                 
         20. How could an operational split be designed so that it would be as effective 
           as the full structural split in achieving its aims, without imposing the costs of 
           a full structural split? In your responses, please also compare and contrast 
           the full structural split to the operational split. 
         21. With regards to the operational split, please provide comments on:  
           a) implementation risks and whether they are surmountable: e.g. how any 
           defined benefit pension schemes could be separated between audit and 
           non-audit services; 
           b) risks of circumvention and how they could be addressed e.g. how audit 
           firms could circumvent the remedy through non-arm’s-length transfer pricing 
           and cost allocations; 
           c) implementation timescales to separate the audit firms and how soon the 
           remedy could be brought into effect; 
           d) ongoing monitoring costs for the audit firms and a regulator;  
           e) role and competencies of a regulator in overseeing ongoing adherence to 
           the operational split. 
         22. Under an operational split, how far, it at all, should it be possible to relax the 
           current restrictions on non-audit services to audit clients? For example 
           through changes to the blacklist or to the current 70% limit.  
         23. Should challenger firms be included within the scope of the structural and 
           operational split remedies? 
         24. Which non-audit services (services other than statutory audits) should the 
           audit practices be permitted to provide under a full structural split and 
           operational split? Please explain your reasoning. 
         
        Remedy 6: Peer review 
         25. What should be the scope (ie which companies) and frequency of peer 
           reviews, if used as a regulatory tool? 
         26. How could peer reviews be designed to best incentivise auditors to retain a 
           high level of scepticism, and thus improve audit quality? 
            
        C) Next steps 
         
         27. What are your views, if any, on our proposal not to make a market 
           investigation reference?  
                           135

                             represent, where appropriate.  
                         •   Please consider whether you are providing any material that you consider 
                             to be confidential, and explain why this is the case. Please provide both a

               Appendix A: Conduct of the market study, and our data sets 
               1.     This appendix provides a chronological description of the conduct of our 
                      market study so far and a description of the data sets we compiled.  
               Chronology 
               2.     On 9 October 2018, the CMA published a Market Study Notice and Invitation 
                                                                                         242
                      to Comment document, along with an administrative timetable.            
               3.     Since then our market study has involved various elements, as listed below. 
                      •   We invited responses to our Invitation to Comment document between 9 
                          and 30 October 2018 and subsequently published on our website 75 
                          responses we received.  
                      •   In October we sent requests for information to the Big Four and five 
                          challenger firms. We sought information on audit tenders, firms’ financials, 
                          individual audit engagements, market data, audit and non-audit services, 
                          investment in technology and their internal documents relating to 
                          measures they may be considering in response to concerns about the 
                          statutory audit market.  
                      •   Between October and November, we sent requests for information to 63 
                          audited companies in the FTSE350 and Top Track 100 companies. 
                          Further details of the requests are set out below in the description of our 
                          data sets. We have also sought information from other companies in 
                          relation to the number of audit firms which bid for their audits. 
                      •   Between 9 October and early December, we held telephone calls and 
                          face to face meetings with over 60 parties to discuss the issues in the 
                          audit market and potential remedies. The parties included the Big Four 
                          and challenger firms, ACCs, investors, the FRC, Prudential Regulation 
                          Authority and pensions regulator, academics, BEIS, Sir John Kingman’s 
                          independent review team and relevant regulatory bodies abroad.  
               4.     We would like to thank all who have assisted in our market study to date.

                  Data sets 
                  5.       We compiled four main data sets using data provided by companies and audit 
                           firms (supplemented by public sources). 
                           (a)  Industry background data set: information on the external auditor, fees 
                                 paid to the external auditor and other commercial details for each 
                                 company included in the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 in the period 2012 
                                 to 2017. 
                           (b)  Tender data: details of tenders of FTSE 350 and Top Track 100 external 
                                 audits, in the period 2013 to 2018, including the firms that participated and 
                                 the fees bid.  
                           (c)  Company sample: for a sample of 24 FTSE 350 companies, information in 
                                 relation to i) tenders for the external audits and ii) the hours spent by audit 
                                 committee members of audit related matters. 
                           (d)  Financial data: for each of the Big Four firms and bigger challenger firms 
                                 (BDO, Grant Thornton, Mazars, RSM and Moore Stephens) information 
                                 on audit and non-audit fees, costs and margins, for the UK firms. 
                  Industry Background data set 
                  6.       We sent formal requests for information to each of the Big Four and bigger 
                           challenger firms (BDO, Grant Thornton, Mazars, RSM and Moore Stephens) 
                           to provide data for all their audit clients in the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 in 
                           the period 2012 to 2017. For this information request, we defined a company 
                           to have formed part of the FTSE 350 index if they had been in the FTSE 100 
                           or 250 for at least two quarters of any year in this period. 
                  7.       For each company identified as being part of the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 
                           in the period 2012 – 2017, the Industry Background data set included the 
                           following: 
                           (a)  the registration number of the company and the UK Standard Industry 
                                 Classification (SIC) Primary code used to classify businesses according to 
                                 the main type of economic activity in which they are engaged;  
                           (b)  the name of the company’s auditor and the year of the company’s first 
                                 audit engagement with their auditor in each year; and  
                           (c)  the fees received by the audit firm from the company in each year, with 
                                 these fees split into the those received for audit or non-audit services 
                                 during the financial year. 
                                                                        138 
                                                                                                           
               8.     Around 86% of the observations included in the Industry Background data set 
                      were taken from the submissions of the nine audit firms, with the remaining 
                      14% sourced from the FAME database. The majority of the company 
                      information taken from FAME (around 61% of the observations sourced from 
                      FAME) were for companies that were included in the Top Track 100 during 
                      the period 2012 – 2017.  
               Tender data  
               9.     We sent formal requests to each of the Big Four and challenger firms for 
                      information on any tenders for FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 audits that they 
                      participated in since January 2013. This included tenders where there was an 
                      informal approach by or discussion with the company.  
               10.    We merged the response to compile information on 247 FTSE 350 tenders 
                      and 23 Top Track 100 tenders which were completed between January 2013 
                      and October 2018. In doing this we used information from the market data to 
                      identify the incumbent audit firm for each tender.  
               11.    In compiling the final data set we: 
                      (a)  excluded information on tenders that occurred before 1 January 2013 and 
                           ongoing tenders; 
                      (b)  excluded information on tenders where there was no identified winner or 
                                243
                           date;    
                      (c)  Excluded information on tenders where the tendering company was not in 
                           the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 for at least two quarters of the year in 
                                                       244
                           which the tender occurred;      and 
                      (d)  excluded the information provided by one challenger firm due to concerns 
                           about its accuracy. 
               12.    The information provided may not be absolutely complete. For example, we 
                      are aware of occasions in our dataset where an audit firm has not included 
                      information on a tender in its submission when it did in fact participate in that 
                      tender. 
                
                
               243
                  Where date information was missing from an individual firm’s submission we first identified whether the 
               relevant tender appeared in other firms’ submissions. Where this was the case we assumed that the tender 
               information with the missing date was for the same date as the most common date for that tendering company 
               across other firms’ submissions. 
               244
                  Where necessary we standardised dates across all firms’ submissions. For example, where, based on 
               information from all firms, the same company appeared to tender in consecutive years we assumed there was 
               only one tender. 
                                                           139 
                                                                                                                    
                Company sample 
                13.     We sent informal information requests to a sample of 58 companies that were 
                        included in the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 in 2018 and had tendered their 
                        external audit in the period 2012 – 2018.  
                14.     We took a two-stage approach to selecting the sample: First, we used the full 
                        list of 450 companies to select 45 companies that would provide a 
                        representative sample. This sampling approach used the company’s total 
                        turnover, turnover from the UK, total and net assets, as well as the company’s 
                        UK SIC code to ensure the sample represented the variation of companies 
                        included in the FTSE 350 or Top Track 100 in 2018. Second, we then added 
                        companies from the full list of 450 companies that allowed the sample to 
                        include companies audited by challenger audit firms or in sectors particularly 
                        important to the UK economy (such as companies that provide financial and 
                        insurance services).  
                15.     We asked the companies to provide information on the following: 
                        (a)  details of the most recent tender for statutory audit services including 
                             information on tender lists, and fees bid and agreed;  
                        (b)  certain documents relating to the most recent tender including: the 
                             request for a proposal; score cards or other methods used by the audit 
                             committee to evaluate bids; records of the audit committee decision in 
                             relation to the selection of the successful audit firm; and any papers 
                             submitted by the audit committee to the main company board and/or 
                             shareholders; 
                        (c)  information on the time spent by audit committee members on audit 
                             committee and external audit related matters, details of the resources 
                             available to ACC and details of communication with the FRC on audit 
                             matters; 
                        (d)  key considerations in selecting the firms invited to tender, factors limiting 
                             choice, views on level of choice, switching costs and experience of 
                             switching; and 
                        (e)  the effects of recent technological developments in audit and financial 
                             reporting on switching auditor.  
                16.     We received full responses from 24 FTSE 350 companies and only one Track 
                        100 company, with some of the requested information provided by one further 
                        Top Track 100 company. 
                                                                140 
                                                                                                                
                Financial data 
                                                                                                      245
                17.    As noted above, we asked the Big Four firms and five challenger firms              to 
                       supply us with financial data covering the period from 2011 to date. We asked 
                       for information covering the following categories: 
                       (a)  an analysis of total annual revenues into three revenue streams: audit 
                            services, non-audit services to audit clients, and non-audit services to 
                            other clients; 
                       (b)  for each of audit and non-audit services, a breakdown of annual revenues 
                            and average revenue recovery rates by specific category of client (FTSE, 
                            AIM, Top Track, etc.); 
                       (c)  a breakdown by the same specific categories (FTSE, AIM, Top Track, 
                            etc.) of each firm’s number of audit clients and aggregated annual audit 
                            hours deployed; 
                       (d)  overheads, direct staff costs and profit margins associated with each of 
                            audit and non-audit services; 
                       (e)  amounts invested into audit IT systems, both globally and in the UK; 
                       (f)  the number of partners, trainees and graduates, support staff and other 
                            staff employed by both the audit and non-audit arms of each firm; 
                       (g)  annual average rates of staff switching from audit to non-audit teams, 
                            analysed separately for trainees and graduates and other staff; and 
                       (h)  average annual partner salaries and drawings, and average annual staff 
                            salaries. 
                18.    We received responses from all nine firms that we sent requests to, although 
                       one audit firm provided partial data and has indicated that it will complete the 
                       response in January 2019. 
                19.    We used the information received to analyse the financial performance of the 
                       firms. In particular we compared and contrasted the audit arms and non-audit 
                       arms within firms, and also collectively the Big Four firms against the 
                       challenger firms.

       Appendix B: use of information provided to the CMA  
       1. This appendix sets out how the CMA may use information provided to it during the 
        course of this market study.  
       Why is the CMA asking for information?  
        
       2. The information you provide will help us better understand how well the statutory 
        audit market is working (for further details of the issues considered see the 
        invitation to comment document).  
       What will the CMA do with the information I provide?  
        
       3. Your information will inform our final market study report. The report will set out 
        our findings and any proposed remedies to any problems we find.  
       4. Where appropriate, we may also use information you provide to take enforcement 
        action, using our competition or consumer powers, against businesses operating 
        in the statutory audit market or may share your information with another 
        enforcement authority (such as local authority Trading Standards Services) or with 
        another regulator for them to consider whether any action is necessary.  
       5. We may only publish or share information in specific circumstances set out in 
        legislation (principally Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002). In particular, prior to 
        publication or any such disclosure, we must have regard to (among other 
        considerations) the need for excluding, so far as is practicable:  
          (a) any information relating to the private affairs of an individual which might, 
          significantly harm the individual’s interests; or  
          (b) any business of an undertaking which, if published or shared, might 
          significantly harm the legitimate business interests of that business.  
       6. We will redact, summarise or aggregate information in published reports where 
        this is appropriate to ensure transparency whilst protecting legitimate consumer or 
        business interests.  
       7. If you wish to submit information either in writing or verbally that you consider 
        confidential and therefore do not wish us to publish or share, please let us know 
        when you contact us with your reasons.  
       8. Any personal data you provide to us will be handled in accordance with our 
        obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Act 
        2018 and any other applicable data protection legislation. Any personal data 
        provided to us will be processed for the purposes of this market study under Part 
        4 of the Enterprise Act 2002. For more information about how the CMA processes
