                  Private messaging over the Internet has proven challenging to                        have even stated that ªif you have enough metadata you don’t
                  implement, because even if message data is encrypted, it is                          really need contentº [33: ¶7] and that ªwe kill people based
                  diiffcult to hide metadata about who is communicating in the                         onmetadataº [23]. This suggests that protecting metadata in

                  clients, because they use techniques with superlinear cost in                        are unable to protect metadata for large numbers of users. Ex-
                  the number of clients (e.g., each client broadcasts their mes-                       isting work falls into two broad categories. On the one hand

                  such as Tor, do not protect against traiffc analysis, making                         such as Dissent [36] and Riposte [12]. Although these sys-

                     Vuvuzela is a new scalable messaging system that offers                           all messages to all users, or use computationally expensive
                  strong privacy guarantees, hiding both message data and meta-                        cryptographic constructions such as Private Information Re-
                  data. Vuvuzela is secure against adversaries that observe and                        trieval (PIR) to trade off computation for bandwidth [34]. As
                  tamper with all network traiffc, and that control all nodes ex-                      a result, these systems have scaled to just 5,000 users [36] or
                  cept for one server. Vuvuzela’s key insight is to minimize                           hundreds of messages per second [12].

                  differential privacy techniques to add noise to all observable                       mixnets [9] provide little protection against powerful adver-
                  variables in a way that provably hides information about which                       saries that can observe and tamper with network traiffc. These
