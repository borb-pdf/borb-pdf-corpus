    at       n       The medical name for golfer’s elbow is medial epicondylitis. The medial epicondyle 
    n ke             is the bony bit you can feel on the inside of your elbow (your funny bone). 
    aert     tie     The tendons of the muscles that run down the front of your arm and into your hand 
    nde u            (flexor muscles) start from the medial epicondyle.

    s thi            What causes Golfer’s Elbow? 
    n n o    or P    It is usually caused by overuse of the flexor muscles with repetitive movements and 
    eiv
     gice     f      movements against resistance. 
    vad                                          Overuse of the flexor muscles can cause

    ubdo                The medial epicondyle will usually be tender to touch and it may also be a

    .  Ifl
    na       W          The pain is made worse with gripping and twisting movements, e.g. opening 
    ossi                 jars, turning a door handle, lifting. Sometimes the pain can be constant.

    alc                 Golfer’s elbow is more likely to be caused if you suddenly do a lot of activity 
    die                  that you are not used to. However it can also start for no apparent reason. 
     m a                Different people will experience varying degrees of pain, ranging from mild
