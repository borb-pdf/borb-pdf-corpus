                                                       NOTES ON INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES 
                                                                                                             
                          This advisory leaflet has been provided to ensure that you are aware of the inspector’s powers, and to 
                          explain any enforcement action the Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Authority (the Authority) may take 
                          to rectify any deficiencies. A further leaflet (General Enforcement Policy) is available to you, which will 
                          explain what to expect when a fire inspector calls. The inspector will explain the reason for the 
                          inspection and what you will be required to provide during the inspection. 
                           
                          As the responsible person it is your duty to ensure the health and safety of your employees and 
                          others, such as members of the public, who could be affected by the way you run your business. The 
                          purpose of an inspection is to sample how you are complying with your legal responsibilities imposed 
                          by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (the Order).

                          iii)       Regulations made under the above Acts. 
                           
                          An inspector may do anything necessary for the purpose of carrying this Order into effect and in 
                          particular shall have the power to do, at any reasonable time, the following-

                          b)         to make such enquiry as may be necessary to ascertain whether the provisions of this order 
                                     have been complied with and to identify the responsible person in relation to the premises;

                                     are required under any provision of the Order or for the purposes of examination under this 
                                     article; 
                          d)         to require any person to give such facilities and assistance to enable the inspector to exercise

                          Where a breach of fire safety legislation is found, the inspector will decide what action to take. The 
                          action will depend on the nature of the breach and will be based on the principles set out in the 
                          Authority’s General Enforcement Policy. 
                           
                          Inspectors may take enforcement action in several ways to deal with a breach of the legislation. In 
                          most cases these will be: 
                                                                                                           1
