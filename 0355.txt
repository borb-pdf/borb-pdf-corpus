              1.0  Introduction 
               
              1.1  In health and safety terms lone workers fall into the vulnerable group category. As lone 
                   workers are more at risk than other employees, extra risk control measures may be 
                   required to ensure the safety of the lone worker. 
               
              1.2  The Health Service Executive (HSE) recognises this and endeavours to provide a safe 
                   working environment for all employees, including lone workers. These guidelines

              2.1  The principle purpose of these guidelines is to ensure a safe and healthy working 
                   environment for all lone workers employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE). 
               
              2.2  In addition the HSE will bring about the reduction so far as is reasonably practicable, of 
                   all reasonably foreseeable risks associated with lone working and to implement any 
                   necessary arrangements to achieve this reduction in line with legislative requirements. 
               
              3.0  Scope 
              3.1  These guidelines are applicable to all HSE lone workers as defined in Section 6.0 of the 
                   guidelines. 
               
               
              4.0  Objective: 
               
              4.1  These guidelines are developed to assist the Health Service Executive to:- 
               
                    To ensure the management of Safety, Health and Welfare is achieved in 
                      accordance with relevant legislation. 
                    
                    Provided safe working practices for staff and assist in the implementation of 
                      same. 
               
               
              5.0  Relevant Legislation 
               
              5.1  The Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 (2005 Act) requires all employers to 
                   provide among other things, safe places and safe systems of work. 
               
              5.2  Section 19 of the 2005 Act requires every employer to identify the hazards in the place 
                   of work under his or her control and assess the risks presented by those hazards and to 
                   be in possession of a written assessment of the risks to the safety, health and welfare 
                   at work of his or her employees, including the safety, health and welfare of any single

                   risks under the relevant statutory provisions. 
               
              5.3  The General Safety and Health Provisions and the General Applications regulations 
                   2007, require employers to take the necessary measures to ensure the Safety, Health 
                   and Protection of Employees. These regulations require that employers must take 
                   account of changing circumstances and carry out risk assessments accordingly. 
                   Training on matters of Health and Safety must also be provided to ensure the Safety 
                   Health and Welfare of employees. 
               
               
              6.0  Definitions and Abbreviations 
              6.1  “Lone Workers” are those who work by themselves without close or direct supervision. 
                   Source: Health and Safety Authority 
               
              6.2  For the purpose of these guidelines a lone worker is anyone who works alone, without 
                   a colleague. 
               
              6.3  Lone workers include those who: 
                    work outside normal hours  
                    work away from their base  
                    work separately from others  
                    are the only person on the premises  
                    work outside in the community  
                    visit people in their homes  
               
              6.4  People who work alone without interaction with other workers or without direct 
                   supervision are known as lone workers. 
               
              6.5  “Reasonably practicable” in relation to the duties of an employer, means that an 
                   employer has exercised all due care by putting in place the necessary protective and 
                   preventive measures, having identified the hazards and assessed the risks to safety 
                   and health likely to result in accidents or injury to health at the place of work 
                   concerned and where the putting in place of any further measures is grossly 
                   disproportionate having regard to the unusual, unforeseeable and exceptional nature 
                   of any circumstance or occurrence that may result in an accident at work or injury to 
                   health at that place of work.  Source: Section 2(6), Safety, Health & Welfare at Work 
                   Act 2005. 
               
              6.6  The extent of an obligation which is said to require an employer to take reasonably 
                   practicable measures has been explored by the courts, particularly in the context of 
                   occupational health and safety law.  For example, in Boyle –v– Marathon Petroleum 
                   (Ireland) Ltd. [1999] 2 IR 460, the Supreme Court held that reasonable practicability 
                   creates a duty that “is more extensive than the common law duty that devolves on 
                   employers to exercise reasonable care in various respects as regards their employees. 
                   It is an obligation to take all practicable steps. That seems to me to involve more than

                        7.0       HSE commitment 
                         
                        7.1       In line with corporate policy the Health Service Executive (HSE) will ensure, in 
                                  accordance with its legal obligations, a safe working environment and safe systems of 
                                  work for lone workers, so far as is reasonably practicable.  Management will not 
                                  tolerate in any form, verbal/physical harassment of its staff by service users’/members 
                                  of the public or others. In the event of an incident the member of staff involved must 
                                  report this to their immediate supervisor/local management without undue delay. All 
                                  foreseeable hazards in relation to lone working must be identified and associated risks 
                                  assessed and documented. To assist in the hazard identification and risk reduction 
                                  process lone workers need to be consulted and receive appropriate training and 
                                  information.  
                         
                        7.2       These guidelines should be read in conjunction with existing HSE policies including the 
                                  Lone Worker Policy.

                        8.1.1     Under section 8 of the 2005 Act, every employer shall ensure, so far as is reasonably 
                                  practicable the safety, health and welfare at work of his or her employees. As lone 
                                  workers are more vulnerable than other workers these duties take on an even greater 
                                  significance.

                        8.4.3     It is not always possible to identify all the hazards relating to lone working, especially 
                                  where the workplace or area is outside of the employer’s immediate control.  In such 
                                  situations lone workers should continually assess the work location, taking account of 
                                  hazards that cannot necessarily be detected in advance such as the influence of 
                                  alcohol, drugs or the threat posed by animals or other hostile elements.  It is vital that 
                                  in such circumstances workers are empowered to make the decision as to whether or 
                                  not it is safe to continue working, or whether to withdraw from the situation.  In

                                  be unique to a specific group of lone workers, local management must establish and 
                                  maintain an appropriate consultative mechanism. In addition this forum should be 
                                  utilised to bring to the attention of the relevant personnel, policies procedures and 
                                  protocols as appropriate. This should be viewed as a support mechanism for the lone

                                  include at minimum induction training that may enhance the safety of the working 
                                  environment for the lone worker or a particular group of lone workers.

                        9.4       Information Sharing 
                         
                        9.4.1     In order to carry out their job safely and efficiently it is important that all lone workers 
                                  have access to appropriate information. Good quality information in relation to 
                                  contacts and locations can prove very helpful. 
                         
                        9.4.2     Each department/section head should ensure that there is an appropriate flow of 
                                  information to and from other departments/outside teams, and that appropriate 
                                  record sharing protocols, in accordance with HSE policies and procedures, are 
                                  followed. This is especially important where there is a higher risk of assault from a 
                                  service user, relative or carer. 
                         
                        9.4.3     Lone workers should be made aware that if, at any stage during a visit they encounter 
                                  aggression they should promptly reassess the situation and withdraw from visit if 
                                  necessary.  Lone workers should report this to their relevant line manager and 
                                  complete the relevant incident report form.   
                         
                        9.5       Referrals 
                         
                        9.5.1     All referrals, or requests for a visit, should be made through an authorised source 
                                  where possible. This may not always be possible given the ethos and practice of self 
                                  referral. The practice and ethos of self referral highlights the need to do all that is 
                                  reasonably practical to ensure a safe system of work is in place. It is the responsibility  
                                  of line management and each individual lone worker to obtain as much information as 
                                  is possible prior to consultation. 
                         
                        9.5.2     Line Managers and lone workers should ensure whenever possible that all service 
                                  users, relatives and carer’s are aware that the preferred channels of communication 
                                  are through an authorised source. This should be communicated in detail to lone 
                                  workers prior to commencing lone working activities where possible. 
                         
                        9.5.3     Lone workers should never provide their personal telephone or pager numbers to 
                                  service user’s relatives or carers.  
                         
                        9.5.4     Where self referral is made from a client that is not known to the service, lone worker 
                                  should be accompanied by a colleague where possible 
                         
                        9.6       Supervision 
                         
                        9.6.1     Given the unique working conditions of the lone worker supervision becomes even 
                                  more significant as it offers a source of valuable support to the lone worker. This can 
                                  be carried out when checking the progress of the work, it may take the form of 
                                  periodic site visits combined with discussions in which health and safety issues are 
                                  raised. The extent of the supervision is directly related to the risk assessment e.g. an 
                                  employee new to a job or undergoing training may need to be accompanied at first.

                        9.6.2     Regular contact between the line manager and the lone worker should be encouraged

                        9.7.1     A control point should be established for the employee to leave details of their lone

                                  place should an employee be in difficulty. In the likelihood of a service user, address or 
                                  area giving cause for concern, the lone worker should be able to advise the control 
                                  point of any deviation from their planned itinerary. 
                         
                        9.7.2     In light of the above it is necessary for each department to establish an appropriate 
                                  control point to manage lone working visits.

                        9.7.4     The control point should also hold details of all the lone workers to ensure that in the 
                                  unlikely event of a lone worker failing to return to/contact the control point at the end 
                                  of a visit, appropriate steps can be taken i.e. the escalation procedure:-

                        9.8.1     In order to reduce the risk to the lone worker all visits should be notified. The method 
                                  of notification should be by mutual agreement between managers and the lone 
                                  workers.

                        9.8.3     It is also important that the lone worker operates a notification protocol when they 
                                  have completed their visit.  Each section/department must have a mutually agreed

                      9.11.1   To achieve success in terms of these guidelines implementation it is important to 
                               recognise difficulties early on and to address them in a realistic and achievable 
                               manner. Difficulties encountered by staff should be promptly brought to the attention 
                               of the relevant line manager in order to achieve a swift and satisfactory outcome. If 
                               the issue cannot be resolved at local level then it must be forwarded as an agenda item 
                               on the next scheduled meeting of the local management team or escalated to the next 
                               level through identified escalation process.

                      9.12.1   The HSE recognises the need for specific and specialised support to staff who may 
                               encounter, in the course of their work, situations which may have a potentially 
                               traumatic effect of their personal and professional life. 
                       
                      9.12.2   This support is offered through the Employee Assistance Service, by a group of 
                               specially trained personnel. It is confidential and addresses the person’s issues in 
                               relation to the incident.  Although this service follows an identifiable procedure it does 
                               not exclude the support which managers and colleagues can give to persons who may 
                               find themselves in such a situation.
