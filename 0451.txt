          What are standards?
              standard  is a document that sets out requirements for a speciifc item material component system or 
             service or describes in detail a particular method or procedure­ Standards are established by consensus 
             and approved by reconized standardization bodies­
             here are several different  types o standards.   Some of the most commonlyused standards set out the 
             requirements that a particular kind of product service or process must fulifl in order to establish that 
             it is ‘ift for purpose’­ ther types of standard relate to methods of testin terminoloy and deifnitions 
             information requirements or the compatibility of connections­
             Standards provide individuals businesses and all kinds of oranizations with a common basis for 
             mutual understandin­ hey are especially useful for communication measurement commerce and 
             manufacturin­
             Standards make trade easier by ensurin compatibility and interoperability of components products 
             and services­ hey brin beneifts to businesses and consumers in terms of reducin costs enhancin 
             performance and improvin safety­
             Standards are voluntary which means that businesses and other oranizations  are not leally oblied to 
             apply them­ However in certain cases standards may facilitate compliance with leal requirements such 
             as those contained in uropean directives and reulations­
                   he primary obective o standardization       is the deifnition of voluntary   
                   technical or quality speciifcations with which current or future products, 
                   production processes or services may comply.        
                   Standardization can cover various issues, such as standardization         
                   of different grades or sizes of a particular product or technical speciifcations 
                   in product or services marets where compatibility        
                   and interoperability with other products or systems are essential.

              Why participate in standardization?
                hile businesses can enoy a wide rane of beneifts simply by usin standards and applyin them 
                correctly there are several reasons why many businesses also choose to actively participate in the 
                development of standards­
                y ettin involved in standardization you can help to shape the content of new standards that will 
                affect your business while they are bein prepared­ ¦ou can make sure that any concerns or issues  
                you consider important are taken into account durin the draftin and development process and prevent                
                or minimize any potential costs or other neative impacts on your business­
                                                                            uropean Standard is shaped   
                                                        by those who contribute to its development. 
                hen you participate in standardization on a reular basis you will also         be better inormed  about all 
                kinds of developments that could impact on your business­ or eample reardin opportunities to revise 
                eistin standards proposals to develop new standards or the introduction of new reulations  either 
                at national or uropean level­
                y takin part in technical roups  whether at national uropean or international level  eperts from 
                your company will beneift from havin      access to the latest knowlede         in a particular ifeld or sector that 
                is essential for your business­ hey will learn about relevant innovations and technoloical developments 
                as well as emerin trends and evolvin market needs­
              ow to participate in standardization?
                usinesses as well as other oranizations and stakeholders can participate in standardization in a number 
                of different ways­ 
                t is up to each business or oranization to choose whether it wishes to et involved in standardization 
                and how it prefers to participate­ his choice will normally depend on a number of factors includin: 
                the number and variety of ifelds or sectors to be followed the availability of technical eperts who could 
                participate in technical work and whether it is possible to combine resources by cooperatin with other 
                companies or oranizations ­
                Have your say at national level
                he main route for businesses or other stakeholders to et involved in standardization is via a ational 
                Standards ody or ational lectrotechnical ommittee­ hese national oranizations can provide you 
                with uptodate information about what standards are bein developed in your domain of interest and 
                how you can help to shape their content­
       ¤2
                         he simplest way to have your say is by submittin written comments in response to public consultations 
                         on draft standards­ hese consultations or ‘enquiries’ must be held in all of the participatin countries 
                         before any new uropean Standard can be adopted by  or ­
                         Should you wish to participate directly in discussions on new standards you can nominate eperts to be 
                         members of national technical bodies includin ‘mirror committees’ which are responsible for followin 
                         and contributin to the development of standards at uropean and/or international level­ 
                         n increasin amount of technical work is bein done electronically either via email or usin webbased 
                         tools known as ‘ecommentin’­ eleconferencin also reduces the need for facetoface meetins 
                         thereby savin time and reducin the costs of participatin in standardization­
