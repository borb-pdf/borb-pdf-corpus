                 Before we do this, I would like to say why SIGGRAPH reviews are                papersprogramcommitteeismadeupof25orsooftheseseniorre-
                 done the way they are. There are two reasons.                                  viewers. With the large number of papers, this partitioning process
                                                                                                takes a full day.
                 The ﬁrst reason is the principal feature of the SIGGRAPH confer-
                 ence publication that makes it very attractive: speed. SIGGRAPH                One copy of your paper is retained by the papers chair. One copy
                 is one of the few high-quality publications that can publish a paper           is mailed to the secondary reviewer, and four copies are mailed to
                 in less than a year. In 10 weeks, SIGGRAPH can do what other                   the senior reviewer. Thus each reviewer receives a large Federal

                 The second reason is that SIGGRAPH has chosen a very differ-                   The senior reviewers receive a set of 14-18 papers. For half of
