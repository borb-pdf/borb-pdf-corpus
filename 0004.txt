        A.  Controller’s Office 
         
         The Controller’s Office staff has the responsibility for ensuring that all payments for 
         goods and services of a non-payroll nature comply with State and Federal laws and 
         regulations, as well as College policies and procedures. 
         
        B.  Faculty and Staff 
         
         College of Charleston faculty and staff have the responsibility for ensuring that they 
         follow procurement guidelines when requesting goods and services.  Faculty and 
         Staff  must  provide  the  Controller’s  Office  with  accurate  and  complete 
         documentation, such as completed forms, justifications or explanations needed for 
         making payments, etc.  In addition, the faculty and staff must ensure that goods and 
         services are satisfactorily received and that they demonstrate a documented benefit 
         to the College. 
         
         
         
         
       C.  Vendors and Payees 
        
         College of Charleston vendors and payees must provide the Controller’s Office with 
         valid invoices that adequately describe the vendors or payees names, addresses, 
         itemized descriptions of goods and services, terms for payment, etc., as well as 
         properly completed Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 or W-8BEN evidencing 
         their business type (corporation, sole-proprietorship, partnership, etc.), domestic or 
         foreign status, and tax identification numbers. 
                            
         ____________________________________________________________ 
                            
                            
               Departments/Offices Affected by the Procedure 
                            
       This procedure affects all members (Faculty, Staff, and Students) of the College of 
       Charleston. 
                            
         ____________________________________________________________ 
                            
                            
                              
                    
                        Procedures 
                           
        
             Reasons for Return of/Delayed Processing of Invoices 
                            
       A.  Payment by the College must be supported by a source document, which in most 
         cases  is  an  independent  invoice.    The  requirement  of  an  invoice  represents 
         confirmation from a third party that a product or service was provided to the College 
         as well as supports the objectivity principle of accounting.  An invoice must meet 
         South Carolina and College criteria for authentication (official invoice, company, 
         letterhead, is legible, etc.). 
        
       B.  Invoices  can  be  rejected  manually  for  missing  purchase  orders,  unauthorized 
         purchases,  insufficient  funds  on  a  purchase  order,  incorrect  vendor  or  payee 
         addresses, missing departmental index numbers, inadequate description of goods 
         or services, or no or incorrect tax identification numbers (Form W-9, W-8BEN, etc.).  
         The automated accounting system rejects items for discrepancies of quantity, unit 
         price or extended price, etc. 
        
         1.  The reason for the return of the document will be indicated on the Controller’s 
          Office Return Slip provided by Accounts Payable. 
           
         2.  The Controller’s Office Return Slip should remain with the corrected document 
          so that the corrected packet will receive priority when returned  to Accounts 
          Payable for processing. 
           
         3.  If the amount on an invoice is inaccurate, the Controller’s Office will require the 
          vendor or payee to furnish a revised document. 
        
         4.  The  Controller’s  Office  staff  has  the  final  decision  for  the  account  code 
          classification of expenditures. 
        
         5.  If  there  are any discrepancies between the attached documentation and the 
          charges shown on the invoice, EA, or travel reimbursement, said discrepancies 
          will need to be reconciled prior to paying the vendor or payee invoice.  Travel 
          and  subsistence  expenditures  should  have  itemized  receipts  attached  to 
          substantiate reimbursement requests.  Meals and taxi fares are excluded from 
          this requirement.  Itemized receipts for lodging and parking must be attached to 
          the reimbursement request in order to be processed by Accounts Payable.  Refer 
          to the Travel Policy on the Controller’s Office website for additional information. 
        
         6.  The vendor or payee shown on the face of the invoice will be compared with the 
          vendor or payee shown on the supporting documentation.  If the vendor or 
          payees do not match, the discrepancy will need to be reconciled prior to paying 
          the vendor or payee invoice. 
        
        
         7.  The vendor or payee number and name indicated on the invoice, EA, or travel 
          packet will be verified against the Controller and Procurement Offices’ vendor 
          file for accuracy.  A W-9 or W-8BEN form for the vendor or payee must be on file 
          identifying  the  business name, SSN/TIN, type of ownership, and permanent 
          residence.  If any of these elements are missing or incorrect, the discrepancies 
          will need to be reconciled prior to paying the vendor or payee invoice, or until a 
          properly completed, and valid, W-9 or W-8BEN is on file.  If the IRS notifies the 
          College that the vendor or payee information does not match the IRS’ file, a 
          payment cannot be processed until further clarification by the vendor, payee, 
          IRS, or Social Security Administration has been received. 
           
          Failure to comply with furnishing properly completed, and valid, W9 or W-8BEN 
          forms may result in backup withholding, and termination of business with the 
          vendor or payee. 
        
       C.  Partial or Short Payments 
        
       Partial payments can be made at the discretion of the A/P Supervisor, based on factors 
       such as, the receipt of fractional shipments or percentage of completion.  If a vendor or 
       payee overcharges the College, Accounts Payable will coordinate with Procurement on 
       the necessary deduction, and notate the adjustment on the vendor record. 
        
       D.  Credit Memos 
        
         1.  If the College has overpaid an invoice, or if the merchandise has been returned, 
          Accounts Payable requests, and applies, the credit memo to the vendor or payee 
          account/invoice.  If the account/invoice has a balance due after the credit memo 
          is applied, an adjusted payment will be authorized.  If the account has a credit 
          balance and there is no immediate payment expected to be made to the vendor, 
          Accounts Payable will request a refund check from the vendor or payee. 
        
         2.  Within 5 to 7 business days, Accounts Payable will notify the department, 
          vendor,  or  payee  contact  that  the  invoice  was  rejected.    Department  staff, 
          vendors,  and  payees  will  be  asked  to  resolve  all  issues  by  submitting  the 
          required paperwork so that processing can be completed. 
           
       E.  Change in Bank Accounts 
        
       All requests to change a vendor bank account for ACH and wire payments will be 
       independently verified.  This is necessary to protect the College from fraud, and for 
       insurance purposes.
