             1.1  What are the speciifc Hazards?
             1.1.1 Manual Handling
             •  Tables and function rooms, making beds delivery or collecting of plates, cutlery and drink trays or 
                 serving customers t is evident that many of the activities in your industry involve manual handling 
             •  anual handling inuries usually result in strains and sprains to workers’ lower back, however 
                 they may also involve the neck and limbs n occasions inuries may result in surgery or lifelong 
                 disability affecting your career and social life  orkers under the age of 18 have bodies which are 
                 still developing and therefore are at greater risk of suffering a permanent inury nury may occur 
                 suddenly or develop gradually over a period of time
                                                              Figure 1: indicates an employee making a bed

                             Figure 2 indicates a waiter carrying plates
                To reduce the likelihood of suffering an injury 
                as a result of manual handling, it’s important to:
      sk your employer for training in preferred manual handling techniues, dealing with speciifc
      manual handling haards and in the use of mechanical euipment
      •  Try and organise your work so manual handling is limited
      •  educe repetitive or sustained bending, twisting and reaching where possible
      •  ush rather than pull
      •  lan the task ifrst
      •  se mechanical euipment where available eg hoists, trolleys, step ladders etc
      •   hen lifting or carrying keep the load as close to your body as possible
      •  se team lifts where appropriate
                           page 4
              1.1.2  The Working Environment
              1.1.2.1   Slips, trips and falls
              •  Slips, trips and falls account for a high proportion of inuries in the hospitality industry  orkers 
                  may eperience inuries involving fractured bones, muscle strains, sprains, cuts and abrasions and 
                  in etreme cases, head inury brain damage
                                     To reduce the likelihood of suffering an injury 
                                   as a result of slips, trips or falls it’s important to:
             •  void cluttered work areas and lfoors
             •   ear footwear appropriate to the type of lfoor surface
             •  eep stairs and lfoors clean and dry
             •  nsure power cords are never placed across walkways
             •  now the procedures for cleaning spilled substances and removal of obects causing a risk
              1.1.2.2   Hot Working Environment
              •  ot working conditions such as those found in kitchens may lead to heat related illness This occurs 
                  when the body is unable to lose heat fast enough to maintain a steady core body temperature
              •  posure to heat may aggravate other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or eisting 
                  heart problems t may result in heat related illnesses such as prickly heat, heat ehaustion fainting, 
                  heat cramps or heat stroke
              •  Signs and symptoms of heat related illness may include one or more of the following
                                  • rashes, muscle cramps, weakness
                                  • diiness, fainting, nausea
                                  • headache 
                                                          page 
      So to avoid suffering a heat related illness it’s important to
             The exposed employees should ensure the following:
     •   ear appropriate clothing summer and winter uniforms etc
     •  rink water and rest in a cool area
     •  se ventilationetraction and airconditioning systems and inform your employer if they appear 
       faulty
     •  e aware of emergencyifrst aid procedures associated with heat related illness
     •  e aware of heat illness risk factors
      1.1.3  Plant
      •  lant refers to both powered and nonpowered machinery n the hospitality industry many pieces 
       of machinery plant are used, including cutters, slicers, dicers, mincers and knives There are a 
       number of potential haards associated with plant including
              • oving parts eg guarding
              • ower source of euipment eg electricity

              • se of pressure euipment eg espresso machines
      •  ¢ou may be inured while using or cleaning machineryeuipment as a result of coming into contact 
       with moving parts or being trapped between moving parts 
                        page 
                 njuries can e reduced through:
      articipating in traininginstruction from your employer concerning the correct use of the euipment if 
      unsure always ask
      •  hecking that all guarding is in place before operation
      •  eeping euipment clean and in good working order
      •  Turning off euipment prior to cleaning
      •  eplacing all guards after cleaning is complete
      •  nly using a machine for its intended purpose
                 When using knies it is important to:
      •  ut away from your body
      •  Store knives safely with the blade pointing down
      •  se personal protective euipment  when reuired eg mesh gloves
      •  se the appropriate knife for the ob eg boning knife
      •  se knives with comfortable and water proof handles

            1.1.4    Chemicals
            any different types of haardous cleaning chemicals are used in the hospitality industry They include 
            washingup liuids, dishwasher detergents and rinse aids, draincleaning products, oven cleaners, 
            disinfectants, toilet cleaners, bleach, sanitiers and descalers
                        Figure 3: Cleaning chemicals are hazardous - wear protection when cleaning 
            1.1.4.1  What are the health risks? 
            •  The most common risks are likely to be through contact with the skin or eyes, breathing in or 
               swallowing
            •  any cleaning chemicals are haardous because they are corrosive and can cause skin and eye 
               burns if splashed onto the body  ithout proper controls, some may cause dermatitis dry, sore, 
               lfaky skin or other skin irritations, asthma and breathing problems
            •  t is highly unlikely that any adult would ever think of drinking a cleaning chemical intentionally but 
               it is still common to ifnd food or drink containers being used to store haardous cleaning substances
            •  Touching the faceeyesskin after handling a cleaning chemical can cause irritation, inlfammation or 
               chemical burns 
            •  Some substances can cause breathing problems if oversprayed, used without adeuate ventilation or 
               sprayed onto hot surfaces, for eample oven cleaner 
            •  There can also be adverse chemical reactions when substances are mied, for eample cleaning 
               products containing bleach mied with acidic toilet cleaners or ammonia will give off harmful gases 
            •  ther risks arise from accidental splashes to the skin and eyes while cleaning chemicals are being 
               poured from one container into another or from spillages while being carried in open containers
                                                   page 8
      To ensure that all possible measures are taken to prevent or reduce eposure to the chemicals used, the 
      employer must 
      Ste 1 ist all the haardous chemicals used 
      Ste 2 onsider whether there is a need to use each substance in the ifrst place Stop using those that 
      are not reuired 
      Ste 3 or each of those substances remaining and for any new cleaning chemicals you later consider, 
      ask your supplier if this is the safest product available or is there a safer alternative, which you should 
      use if it is available sk your supplier if you can purchase diluted products in smaller containers that will 
      be easier to use 
      Ste 4 or all chemicals used, record a description of their use, eg oven cleaner, and a description of 
      the type of haard they represent, eg irritantcorrosivetoic etc this will be found in the product safety 
      data sheets or product labels t will include instructions on ifrstaid measures and advice on what to 
      do in case of accidental spillages f you do not have this information ask your supplier to provide it 
      anufacturers and suppliers of haardous substances are reuired by law to provide safety information 
      on their products 
      Ste  onsider where and how the chemicals are used or handled void pouring from and using 
      bulk containers, as these can be heavy and hard to hold inimise handling, eg by use of appropriate 
      syphons, pumps etc, use smaller containers, and avoid carrying open containers, especially if lfoors are 
      wet or slippery 
      Ste  Try to keep chemicals in their original containers and, if decanting, ensure that containers are 
      clearly marked and labelled with the manufacturer’s instructions for use The label should clearly identify 
      the haards of the substance This will help to prevent any confusion regarding the contents 
      Ste  onsider the safe storage arrangements ¬away from heat, sunlight, foodstuffs and members 
      of public, especially children ontainers should all have lids and be clearly labelled leaning and 
      disinfecting chemicals should be securely stored lways check manufacturers’ storage instructions, as 
      some products may need to be stored separately from others 
      Ste  nsure all your employees are informed, trained, and supervised in the use of cleaning 
      chemicals t will not be enough ust to issue safety data sheets you must ensure that your employees 
      understand the haards and the measures needed to control any risks
      Ste   Take into consideration any of your staff who do not have nglish as a ifrst language ¢ou must 
      ensure that they clearly understand osters or graphics can help as reminders on carrying out the ob 
      safely emember employees and their safety representatives should be consulted about health and safety 
      issues including the use of cleaning chemicals They may have eperienced problems or come up with 
      solutions that you may not have considered 
      Ste 1­ onitor and review employees’ use of cleaning chemicals Supervisors should observe that 
      they are being used and stored correctly nsure new employees are trained 
                       page 
      Ste 11 ake sure appropriate protective clothing is available when using the cleaning chemical This 
      could include eye protection, various types of gloves, facemasks and visors etc ate gloves are known 
      to cause reactions and should be avoided mployees must be trained when and how to use and replace 
      such protection 
      Ste 12 heck ifrstaid arrangements Staff should be trained in ifrstaid actions to take in the event of 
      accidental contact with skin or eyes, and appropriate ifrstaid provision should be available, eg eyewash 
      bottles Safety data sheets should be kept in a place known to staff in the event that they need to be 
      referred to in case of spillage or an accident
      The employees must cooperate with the employer and ensure the following
      •  lways follow carefully any instructions and training information given in the use of cleaning 
       chemicals
      •  emember that your safety representative and you as an employee are entitled to be consulted by 
       your employer about health and safety issues including the use of cleaning chemicals
      •   hen handling substances, especially concentrates if unavoidable, always wear the protective 
       clothing provided, eg rubber gloves f there is any danger of splashing, wear eye protection suitable 
       for splash risks, eg goggles or visors, and ensure an eyewash bottle is available f cleaning at eye 
       level or above, wear eye protection 
      •  heck that rubber gloves are free from holes, tears or thin patches f any of these faults are present 
       ask for replacements immediately Tell your employer if you eperience any irritation or allergy from 
       gloves you have used
      •  ¡ever mi cleaning chemicals 
      •   hen diluting always add the concentrated liuid to water, not the water to the concentrate 
      •  f cleaning chemicals are accidentally splashed onto your skin or eyes, always wash away with plenty 
       of water Seek medical advice if irritation persists and tell your employer 
      •  void lifting and pouring from heavy or awkward bulk containers, minimise handling by use of 
       syphons, pumps etc
      •  f you are dispensing powders, always use a scoop never use your hand 
      •  ¡ever transfer cleaning chemicals into food or drink containers where they can easily be mistaken 
       for foodstuffs nsure spray bottles are other containers are clearly marked with their contents 
      •  f aerosols are used for cleaning, never spray onto hot surfaces as this can produce harmful vapours 
       ¡ever place aerosols on hot surfaces
                       page 1¥
      •  nly use cleaning chemicals in wellventilated areas Sometimes an open window will be enough, 
       but proper etract ventilation should be installed if fumes are a risk  suitable fume mask and 
       goggles may also be reuired depending on manufacturer’s instructions
      •  lways clean up any spills on lfoors or work surfaces immediately 
      •  lways store chemicals as manufacturers advise, for eample away from heat, sunlight, foodstuffs 
       and members of the public, especially children
      •  nsure chemicals are disposed of properly, as instructed by your employer following the information 
       given in the safety data sheet
      •  et your supervisor or manager know immediately if you eperience any adverse reactions to 
       substances, for eample headaches, nausea, skin complaints
