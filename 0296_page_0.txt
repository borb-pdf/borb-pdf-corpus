                  Early American papermakers used cotton and                                                .

                  small quantities of strong and durable papers.                mechanical wood pulp, it was first developed

                  This early American hand-made paper has long                  fibers, which are also highly acidic due to the 
                  cellulose fibers and little grain, making it                  retention of the wood’s lignin.
