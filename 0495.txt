                              (a)     The following definitions are used in this Budget Paper: 
                                        –     ‘real’ means adjusted for the effect of inflation; 
                                        –     real growth in expenses and payments is calculatedng u tsihe 
                                              Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the deflator; 
                                        –     the Budget year refers to 2019-20, while the forward years refer to 2020-21, 
                                              2021-22 and 2022-23; and 
                                        –     one billion is equal to one thousand million. 
                              (b)     Figures in tables and generally in the text have been ronuded. Discrepancies in 
                                      tables between totals and sums of components are due to rounding: 
                                        –     estimates under $100,000 are rounded to the nearest thousand; 
                                        –     estimates $100,000 and over are generally rounded to the nearest tenth of 
                                              a million; 
                                        –     estimates midway between rounding points are rounded up; and 
                                        –     the percentage changes in statistical tables are calculated using 
                                              unrounded data. 
                              (c)     For the budget balance, a negative sign indicates a deficit while no sign indicates 
                                      a surplus.

                                                STATEMENT 1: BUDGET OVERVIEW 
                               The 2019-20 Budget delivers a surplus for the first time in over a decade. This 
                               Budget reinforces the Government’s commitment to investing in Australia’s future 
                               by strengthening the economy and guaranteeing essential services, while keeping 
                               taxes low. 
                               Australia’s economy remains in fundamentally good shape. Employment growth 
                               has been strong  with over 1.2 million jobs created s  Sepincetember  2013. The 
                               unemployment rate is at its lowest level in more than seven years and the 
                               participation rate is at a near-record high. However, there are a range of risks both 
                               domestically and abroad. 
                               The  plan for a stronger economy is  based on fiscal discipline and policies that 
                               enhance the economy’s productive potential. This plan will help meet the challenges 
                               ahead while boosting incomes. 
                               The underlying cash balance is foreca stto be a surplus of $7.1 billion in 20192-0, 
                               with surpluses projected to build to more than 1 per cent of GDP in the medium 
                               term. 
                               With the budget returning to surplus, the Government is strengthening ist focus on 
                               paying down debt to reduce the fiscal burden on future generations. 
                               Over the medium term,n et debt is projected to be eliminated entirely angd ross 
                               debt is projected to fall to 12.8 per cent of GDP. 
                               The Government is delivering lower taxes by: 
                               •   providing tax relief to hard-working low- and middle-income Australians, with 
                                   immediate relief of up to $1,080 forn gslei s, or up to $2,160 for duaincoml                     e 
                                   families, and structural reform so a projected 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers 
                                   will face a marginal tax rate no higher than 30 per cent in 2024-25; 
                               •   providing lower taxes to small and medium-sized businesses by increasing the

                                   Government has already legislated; and 
                               •   safeguarding the integrity of the tax system b ensyuring everyone, including 
                                   multinationals and big business, pay their fair share.

                     STATEMENT 1: BUDGET OVERVIEW 
             INTRODUCTION 
             The 2019-20 Budget confirms the return to a surplus i-n2 20, w019ith surpluses 
             continuing over the medium term. These surpluses will pay down debt to ensure that 
             Australia is better equipped to deal with future challenges and redu to ce the fiscal 
             burden on future generations. 
             The Australian economy is fundamentally sound, with the unemployment rate falling 
             to 4.9 per cent and the creation of more than 1.2 million jobs since September 2013. 
             Real GDP is expected to grow at around its estimated potential rate of 2¾ per cent in 
             2019-20 and 2020-21. The economy is expected to be supported b syolid growth in 
             business investment, exports and the rol-lout of major publici nfrastructure projects. 
             Growth in Australia’s major trading partners has outpaced global growth over the past 
             decade. This is forecast to continue and, combined with new opportunities from 
             Australia’s growing number of free trade agreements, will support the domestic 
             economy. At the same time, there are a number of risks and uncertainties around the 
             outlook, including global trade tensions and conditions in the domestic housing 
             market. 
             The Government is building on its Personal Income Tax Plan announced   in the
             2018-19 Budget. In this Budget, the Government will provide additional tax relief for 
             low- and middle-income earners to reward hard-working Australians and support 
             consumption growth.  The Government will also introduce furtherstr  uctural tax 
             reform, lowering the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent from 2024-25. Combined with 
             the already legislated abolition of the 37 per cent tax rate from that year, this means a 
             single 30 per cent marginal tax rate will apply to taxable incomes from $45,000 to 
             $200,000. These changes will improve incentives for ha-wrdorking Australians and 
             increase the reward for effort while maintaining a progressive tax system. 
             The Government continues to invest in productivi-teynhancing infrastructure to ease 
             congestion and manage a growing population, as well as providing Australians with 
             the essential services they rely on. 
             After a decade of deficits, the udbget  is returning to surplus in 2-02019 with an 
             underlying cash surplus of $7.1 billion, equal to 0.4 per cent of GD.P Sustained fiscal 
             discipline will ensure these surpluses exceed 1 per cent of GDP in the medium term. 
             Maintaining a strong economy and ongoing fiscal discipline is the best way of securing 
             a more prosperous future for Australians.

                          Payments as a proportion of GDP are expected to fall to 24.5 per cent by the end of the 
                          forward estimates, slightly lower than froecast at the 2018-19 MYEFO and remaining 
                          lower than the 30-year average of 24.7 per cent of GDP. 
                          Receipts as a proportion of GDP are expected to increase over the forward estimates, 
                          broadly in line with forecasts at the 201-189 MYEFO, with tax receipts remaining 
                          below the Government’s tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent. 
                          Net debt is forecast to fall to 18 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 and will continue to decline 
                          as a share of GDP over the forward estimate Fs.urther improvements are projected 
                          across the medium term to eliminate net debt by 2029-30. Gross debt will also fall 
                          below its 30-year average in the medium term. 
                          ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 
                                                                           th
                          The Australian economy has entered its 2 8consecutive year of annual economic 
                          growth and its fundamentals are sound. Real GDP is forecast to grow at around its 
                          estimated potential rate of 2¾ per cent i-20 ann 20d19 202-201. Household 
                          consumption, business investment, public final demand and exports are all forecast to 
                          contribute to growth. The unemployment rate is expected to be  p5er cent across the 
                          forecast period. 
                          The economy is expected to continue to benefit from solgidlob  al growth, especially 
                          amongst Australia’s major trading partners. While there was some loss of momentum 
                          in the international economy in the second half of 2018 and the IMF and OECD have 
                          revised down theirg  rowth projections, global growth continues to be supported by 
                          accommodative monetary policy, solid labour market outcomes and the unwinding of 
                          some temporary dampening factors such as natural disasters in Japan. 
                                                                       1-6 
                                  Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
           Domestically, household consumption growth is expected to pick up over the forecast 
           period supported by continued growth in employment, a pi-upck in wage growth, 
           historically low interest rates and the Government’s personal income tax  relief
           measures, which hae bv een further enhanced in this Budget and will support 
           household disposable income. Business investment is forecast to record solid growt.h 
           Public final demand will contribute to growth as the Government continues to provide 
           essential services such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme and deliver on its 
           $100 billion  infrastructure plan.  Growth in exports in 20-2109 is expected to be 
           supported by major liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects ramping up production and 
           continuing strong demand for education and travel services from Asia. Rural exports 
           are expected to contribute to growth in 201-920 on the basis of an assumed return to 
           average seasonal conditions, following a detraction from growth in 2018-19 as a result 
           of the drought. 
           The labour market is strong, with employment recently growing above its long-run 
           average rate and faster than Australia’s population growth. The unemployment rate is 
           at its lowest level in more than s evyeenars and the participation rate is at a 
           near-record high. The female participation rate is historically high and youth labour 
           market outcomes have improved recently. Employment growth is expected to be solid 
           over the forecast period and the unemployment rate is forecast to be 5 per c enAs t.
           growth in the economy picks up and spare capacity in the labour market continues to 
           be reduced, wage growth and inflation are expected to rise.  
           Nominal GDP is forecast to grow by 5 per cent in 2018-19, 3¼ per cent in 2019-20 and 
           3¾ per cent in 2020-21. Nominal GDP growth is influenced by the terms of trade, 
           which have been supported recently by highe-thran-assumed commodity prices, in 
           particular for iron ore and metallurgical coal. The moderation in nominal GDP growth 
           in 2019-20 reflects a fall in the terms of trade as key commodity prices are assumed to 
           decline to more sustainable levels. This is partially offs byet a pick-up in real GDP 
           growth and in wages and domestic prices. 
           As always there are a number of risks and uncertainties around the forecasts. 
           Internationally, while some risks have lessened somewhat since the MYEFO, downside 
           risks remain around trade tensions, emerging market debt vulnerabilities and 
           geopolitical issues. The risks associated with Brexit have become more pronounced in 
           recent months although Australia’s trade is oriented more towards Asia than Europe.

           1.9 per cent under the Government, the lowest average of any government in 50 years.  
           The Government has continued to offset new spending decisions to make room for 
           new spending priorities .Since 2013-14, the Government has implemented savings 
           measures with a combined effect of more than $200 billion through to 2022-23.  
           A stronger economy and sustained fiscal discipline has ebnaled the Government to 
           guarantee essential services, invest in important economic and community 
           infrastructure, and respond to unexpected developments, including the severe effects 
           of drought and floods in parts of Australia. 
           The Government is committed to keeping the tax burden on hard-working Australians 
           as low as possible. Tax receipts as a share of GDP are expected to be 23.3 per cent in 
           2019-20 and remain below 23.9 per cent until 2029-30.  
           Compared with the 2018-19 MYEFO, the 2019-20 Budget forecasts for tax receipts have 
           been revised down by $18.2 billion over the four years to 202-223. The revisions have 
           been driven by parameter and other variations, and policy decisions, including the 
           Government’s measure Lower taxes for hard-working Australians: Building on the Personal 
           Income Tax Plan .Policy decisions are expected to reduce tax receipts by $ bil3li.2on 
           over the four years to 2022-23.  
           Excluding policy decisions, tax receipts have been revised down by $15 billion over the 
           four years to 2022-23, as revisions to the outlook for household consumption, dwelling 
           investment and average wages weigh on the forecasts. In the near term, however, this 
           impact will be more than offset by an increase in company tax collections i2018n  -19 
           and 2019-20, reflecting the recent observed strength in commodity prices.  
           Net debt is expected to be 18 per cent of GDP in 2019-20, and is projected to continue 
           to decline before being eliminated entirely in the final year of the medium term. Gross 
           debt is expected to be 27.9 per cent of GDP in 2019-20, falling to 12.8 per cent of GDP 
           by the end of the medium term, below its 30-year average.  
           With ongoing risks to the global economy, strong fiscal management is essential to 
           build the buffers that will allow the Australian economy to better absorb major 
           economic and financial shocks that may be encountered in the future.

              Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
              BUDGET PRIORITIES 
              A better tax system 
              The Government is continuing to provide lower taxes for h-awrdorking Australians 
              and small and mediusmiz-ed  business, and is improving the integrity of the tax 
              system. 
              Lower taxes for hard-working Australians 
              In this Budget, the Government will again provide ta x relief for 
              hard-working low-  and middle-income Australians. Combined with the legislated 
              Personal Income Tax Plan, this Budget will provide immediate relief of up to $1,080 for 
              singles, or up to $2,160 for duainlc ome families from 20181-9. It will also deliver 
              further structural reform, so that a projected 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers will 
              face a marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent in 2024-25. 
              These changes will maintain Australia’s progressive tax system and ease tchose t of 
              living. The structural changes improve incentives for working Australians and increase 
              the reward for eff. Torthe changes are consistent with the Government’s goals of 
              maintaining a strong economy whilst retaining a sound fiscal position. They build on 
              the Government’s legsilated Personal Income Tax Plana nnounced in the 201-819 
              Budget.  
              Immediate relief targeted to low- and middle-income earners 
              From the 2018-19 income year, additional tax relief will be provided to l- oawnd 
              middle-income taxpayers through an increase to the current low and middle income 
              tax offset (LMITO). Under the changes, the maximum tax relief provided by LMITO 
              will increase by $550 from the previous level of $530 to a new maximum of $1,080. The 
              base amount will increase from $200 to $255 for 20-1918 and the next three income 
              years. The LMITO will be received after individuals lodge their 2018-19 tax returns and 
              will continue to be provided in addition to the low income tax offset (LITO). 
              The LMITO will assist over 10 milioln Australians, with about 4.5 million taxpayers 
              with taxable incomes between $48,000 and $90,000 receiving the full $1,080 reduction 
              in tax for 2018-19. Families with two people earningb etween $48,000 and $90,000 will 
              receive a total reduction in tax of $2,160. Around 2.3 million Australians with taxable 
              incomes less than $37,000 will receive an offset of up to $255. 
              This additional tax relief builds on the increase to the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent 
              tax bracket from $87,000 to $90,000, which took effect from 1 July 2018.

                                     Locking in the benefits of lower taxes 
                                     The Government will lock in the benefits of the increased LMITO through changes to 
                                     income tax thresholds and LITO from 1 July 2022. The top threshold of the 19 per cent 
                                     tax bracket will increase from $41,000 as legislated under the plan to $45,000 and the 
                                     maximum amount of the LITO will increase from $645 to $700. In total, the 
                                     Government’s enhanced plan will benefit 12.6 million taxpayers in 2022-23. 
                                     The widening of the top threshold of the 19 per ceax bnt tracket from $41,000 to 
                                     $45,000 will prevent around 590,000 taxpayers from entering the 32.5 per cent tax 
                                     bracket in 2022-23. This builds on the already legislated increase in the top threshold of 
                                     the 19 per cent tax bracket from $37,000 to $41, w,000hich is projected to prevent 
                                     around 560,000 taxpayers from paying tax at the 32.5 per cent tax rate in 2022-23. In 
                                     total, more than one million taxpayers will stay under the 32.5 per cent marginal tax 
                                     rate in 2022-23 as a result of the Government’s enhanced plan. 
                                     The change to the 19 per cent tax bracket builds on the increase to the top threshold of 
                                     the 32.5 per cent tax bracket from $90,000 to $120,000, which has already been 
                                     legislated. This change will prevent around 1.8 millionta xpayers from entering te h
                                     37 per cent tax bracket in 2022-23. 
                                     Structural reforms to the tax system to deliver permanently lower taxes 
                                     From 1 July 2024, in addition to the already legislated abolition of the 37 per cent tax 
                                     rate, the Government will continue to simplify and flantte the tax system to reward 
                                     hard-working Australians by reducing the 32.5 per cent rate to 30 per cent fotrax  able 
                                     incomes  between  $45,000  and  $200,000. The top marginal rate of 45 per cent will 
                                     remain for taxable incomes above $200,000. 
                                                                                                     1-11 
           Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
           Reducing the 32.5 per cent rate to 30 per cent will more closely align the middle tax 
           rate of the personal income tax system with corporate tax rates, improving incentives 
           for working Australians and increasing the reward for effort. It will also encourage 
           Australians to take on additional work and improve their skills because extra earnings 
           will  not  be taxed at a high emr arginal rate. Around 13.3 milli otnaxpayers are 
           estimated to benefit as a result of the full enhanced plan. 
           At maturity, the new, simpler tax system will have only three tax rates and will ensure 
           that a projected 94 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of no higher than 
           30 per cent. This is compared to a projected 16 per cen tof taxpayers who would have 
           faced a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less if the plan was notce in, a pndla a 
           projected 63 per cent of taxpayers who would have faced a marginal tax rate of 32.5 
           per cent or less. 
           Australia currently has relatively high rates of tax, cutting in at relatively low levels of 
           income compared with other countries. Australia’s top marginal tax rate cuts in at 
           around 2.2 times average full-time earnings, compared with 4 times in Canada and the 
           UK, and 8 times in the US. Without the changes announced in last year’s Budget, 
           Australia’s ratio was pjecroted to drop to around 1.7, reducing Australia’s 
           international competitiveness and ability to attract and retain talent. Increasing the 
           bottom threshold of the top tax bracket from $180,000 to $200,000 as legislated means 
           that this ratio is now expected to fall more modestly to around 1.9. 
           Australia will retain a progressive tax system in which those with the greatest ability to 
           pay will continue to contribute a larger share of all personal income tax revenue. It is 
           projected that in 2024-25 around 60 per cent of all personal income tax will be paid by 
           the highest earning 20 per cent of taxpayers, which is broadly similar to that cohort’s 
           share if 2017-18 rates and thresholds were left unchanged. By 2024-25 someone earning 
           $200,000 will pay around 10 times more tax than someone earning $45,000.

                               The Government is supporting small and mediu-msized businesses to invest, grow 
                               and create jobs. 
                               Lower taxes have been fast tracked for aronud 3.4 million small and medium-sized 
                               businesses that employ around 7.1 million worker.s Companies with an aggregated 
                               annual turnover below $50 million will have a tax rate of just 25 per cent in 202221, -
                               five years earlier than previously planned. Similar fast tracking will apply to rolling 
                               out the 16 per cent tax discount for unincorporated businesses. 
                               The Government is increasing the instant asset write-off threshold for eligible assets to 
                               $30,000. It is also expanding access to mediu-simzed businesses by increasing the 
                               aggregated annual turnover threshold for eligibility from $10 million to $50 million. 
                               Around 22,000 additional businesses, employing around 1.7 million workers will now 
                               be eligible to access the instant asset write-off. This will bring the number of businesses 
                               that are eligible to around 3.4 million, employing around 7.7 million workers. 
                               The increased instant asset wri-toeff threshold and expanded eligibility will apply 
                               from 7:30pm (AEDT) on 2 April 2019 until 30 June 2020, allowing small and 
                               medium-sized businesses to immediately deduct eligible assets costing less than 
                               $30,000. The threshold applies on a per asset basis, so eligible businesess  can instantly 
                               write off multiple assets. 
                                                                                    1-13 
           Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
           This builds on the Government’s announcement of 29 January 2019 that increased the 
           instant asset write-off threshold for small businesses to $25,000.  
           Improving the integrity of the tax system 
           The Government is safeguarding the integrity of the tax system by ensuring everyone, 
           including multinationals and big business, pay their fair share. Maintaining tax system 
           integrity helps keep taxes as low as possible and creates a level playing field between 
           businesses. 
           The Government has taken major steps to increase the integrity of the tax system. The 
           Government has implemented more than a dozen measures, including the 
           Multinational Anativ-oidance Law (MAAL), the Diverted P rofits Tax,
           Country-by-Country Reporting, strengthened transfer pricing rules, hybrid mismatch 
           rules, the Multilateral Instrument and increased penalties for large entities that do not 
           comply with their tax obligations. The ATO estimates the MAAL alone will bring an 
           additional $7 billion of sales revenue back into the Australian tax base each year. Since 
           1 July 2016, the ATO has raised $12.9 billion in tax liabilities against large public 
           groups and multinationals, as well as wealthy individuals and associated groups. 
           In this Budget, the Government is extending and expanding the ATO’s Tax Avoidance 
           Taskforce, which will help ensure multinationals, trusts and high wealth individuals 
           pay the right amount of tax in Australia. This measure is estimated to raise $4.6 billion 
           in additional tax liabilities over the forward estimates period. 
           The operations of the black economy risk undermining thtea x and other regulatory 
           systems and raises the burden on honest individuals and businesses. Taking measures 
           to tackle its operation remains a priority. The Government has already taken action to 
           clampdown on the black economy, estimated to generate in excess of an additional 
           $5 billion to help fund essential Government services. This has been achieved by 
           extending the taxable payments reporting system to higher risk industries, banning the 
           use of sales suppression tools and establishing the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce. 
           Investing in economic and community infrastructure 
           Planning for Australia’s future population 
           The Government has released Planning for Australia’s future population, a plan to better 
           manage population challenges, including through the Migration Program and 
           increased investment in infrastructure and services in Australia’s cities and regions.  
           The planning level of the Migration Program will be reduced from 190,000 to 
           160,000 places for four years from 201-920. The Government is also introducing new 
           visas to support regional Australia and create stronger incentives for new migrants to 
           settle outside the major capitals.  
                              1-14 
                                  Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
           These measures are designed to reduce pressure on Australia’s major cities while new 
           arrangements for improved planning across government and more infrastructure are 
           put in place to manage long-term population growth and settlement across Australia.  
           Managing growth in major cities and investing in the regions 
           A strong economy depends on ongoing investment in infrastructure to ease congestion 
           in cities and unlock the potential of Australia’s regions. 
           The  Australian  Government  will provide a record $100 billio  in n funding for its 
           infrastructure plan over the next decade, an increase of around a third compared to the 
           2018-19 Budget.  
           This record level of transport infrastructure investment will help get Australians home 
           sooner and safer. These investments also directly support economic activity, create jobs 
           and lift productivity by cutting travel time between worksites and getting products to 
           customers more reliably and quickly.  
           The Government is committing $2 billion to help deliver a fast rail connection between 
           Geelong and Melbourne. This funding willp rovide commuters on this key transport 
           corridor with faster and more reliable journey times, cutting travel time in half to just 
           over 30 minutes. The Government will also c-fuond five business cases with state 
           governments for fast rail from Sydney to Wollongong, Sydney to Parkes (via Bathurst 
           and Orange), Melbourne to Albury Wodonga, Melbourne to Traralgon, and Brisbane 
           to the Gold Coast. These will build on the fast rail business cases already underway for 
           Sydney to Newcastle, Melbourne to Greater Shepparton, and Brisbane to the regions of 
           Moreton Bay and the Sunshine Coast.  
           The Government is contributing an additional $3 billion to the Urban Congestion 
           Fund, increasing total funding to $4 billion. This will include $500 million for a 
           Commuter Car Park Fund, which will improve access to public transport by funding 
           park and ride facilities at rail stations. Urban Congestion Fund projects will target 
           congestion in some of the worst affected urban areas and address local pinch points. 
           Australians expect their roads to be safe. The Government is providing $2.2 billion for 
           a Local and State Government Road Safety Package. This includes additional funding 
           of $1.1 billion for the Roads to Recovery Program; $550 million for the Black Spots 
           Program; $275 millnio for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productiv iPtyrogram; and 
           $275 million for the Bridges Renewal Program. 
           An additional $1 billion is being provided for the next phase of the Roads of Strategic 
           Importance initiative, increasing total funding to $4.5 billi. Tonhis includes further 
           investment in strategic corridors, associated feeder roads and other rural roads across 
           the countr.y This will facilitate additionalu pgrades of key freight routes to better 
           connect the agriculture and resource sectors to export markets and improve road 
           safety.

                    Since 2013, the Government has delivered more than $3 billion in support to regional 
                    communities through various grants and progarms. The Government is increasing 
                    support to regional Australians with an additiona $1l  billion available through the 
                    Building Better Regions Fund, Stronger Communities Programme, Stronger Regional 
                    Connectivity Packag,e Regional Airports Program, Commuens Eiti   nvironment 
                    Program and tourism projects. These investments will improve liveability through 
                    better connectivity and access to services.  
                    Supporting Australians through drought and natural disasters 
                    The Government is providing $6.3 billion of assistance andcon  cessional  loans to 
                    support those affected by drought and $3.3 billion to support those affected by flood.  
                    The Government has invested in future drought resilience by establishing the new 
                    Future Drought Fund with an initial investment of $3.9 billion. Each year $100 million 
                    of fund earnings will be made available for important water infrastructure and 
                    drought resilience projects, with the balance reinvested so the Fund grows to $5 billion 
                    over the next decade.  
                    Grant funding of $300 million will be provided this year to support flood-affected 
                    farmers in North Queensland in restocking, replanting and replacing damaged 
                    infrastructure. This is in addition to $232 million that has been made available to help 
                    North Queenslanders manage the impacts of the recent flood and weather events.  
                    The Government is working closely with the banking sector on proposals to lower the 
                    interest rate on business loans for eligible primary producers affected by floods in 
                    Northern Queensland to ensure accessible and affordable funding.  
                    The Government is also creating a new $3.9 billion Emergency Response Fund (ERF) to 
                    provide a sustainable source of funding to respond to future natural disasters. The ERF 
                    will be established a sa Commonwealth Investment Fund to finance natural disaster 
                    recovery and response initiatives abovne ad beyond existing state and federal

           builds on the Government ’esxisting commitment to a $17 million Children’s Online 
           Safety Package.  
           A further $58.2 million is being invested in the Safer Communities Fund to support 
           local councils and community organisations to undertake crime prevention activities, 
           and help protect schools, religious organisations and other sites from the risks 
           associated with religious and racial intolerance.  
           This Budget is increasing support for migrants to become established and integrated in 
           their communities through an additional $64.2 mi lflioron new social cohesion 
           measures. This funding will be used to support local sports programs, community 
           languages, national community hubs alivnder g drae nts that will encourage 
           integration, mutual understanding and celebrate diversity.  
           The Government’s comprehensive drug strategy includes $152 million to strengthen 
           law enforcement efforts to disrupt and reduce the supply of illicit drugs including by 
           targeting the threat posed by outlaw motorcycle gangs.

           Supporting veterans and their families 
           The Government is improving the wellbeing of veterans and their families by 
           continuing  the  Putting Veterans and their Families First  program. This program will 
           provide earlier access to services, simplified access to treatment and improved care for 
           veterans with complex circumstances. 
           The Government is also providing the Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical Team 
           members who worked in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972 with a Gold Card to better 
           recognise the service of this group. In addition, the Government is supporting veterans 
           by investing more than $16 million to assist veterans to find meaningful employment. 
           More than $4 million is being provided to extend the Provisional Access to Medical 
           Treatment Trial and $4 million to provide awareness and intervention training to 
           volunteers who work with veteran  sto recognise people at risk and provide 
           intervention and suppor.t These measures demonstrate the Government’s ongoing 
           commitment to recognise and appreciate veterans’ service to Australia. 
           Restoring trust in the financial system 
           A strong and trusted financial system is a pillar of the Australian economy. That is 
           why a key part of the Government’s plan for a stronger economy is restoring trust in 
           Australia’s financial system. 
           Since coming into office, the Government has implemented a comprehensive financial 
           system reform agenda to improve outcomes for consumers and small buessi,n ess
           increase the accountability of financial institutions and enhance the powers and 
           resources of the financial system regulators. 
           Building on these reforms, the Government is taking action on all 76 recommendations 
           of the Royal Commission and, in a number of important areas, is going further, with 
           implementation already underway. 
           In this Budget, the Government is ensuring the financial system regulators have the 
           resources they need to expand their capability to deliver on their new responsibilities 
           and new enforcement and supervision approach.  
           The Government will provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission 
           (ASIC) with additional funding of $404 m.8illion so that it can undertake an 
           accelerated enforcement strategy, implemenat n enhanced onsite supervisory 
           capability for large institutions and deliver on its expanded role in relation to 
           superannuation as recommended by the Royal Commission.  
           The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s (APRA) budget will be increased by 
           $151.7 million to strengthen its supervisory and enforcement activities, including in 
           relation to governance, culture and remuneraion,t  and to enhance the regulation of 
           superannuation funds. The funding will also support the expansion of the Banking 
           Executive Accountability Regime to include all A-PregRAulated entities. The 
                              1-24 
                                  Budget Statement 1: Budget Overview 
           Government will also establish a new Financial Regulator Osivghert Authority as 
           recommended by the Royal Commission to assess ASIC and APRA’s effectiveness on 
           an ongoing basis.  
           The Government is ensuring consumers and small businesses affected by misconduct 
           have access to redress. It will provide $36.1 millionom top censate consumers and 
           small businesses who have legacy unpaid external dispute resolution determinations; 
           establish an industr-yfunded compensation scheme of last resort; and extend the 
           jurisdiction of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority to enable it to consider 
           eligible complaints that have occurred since 1 January 2008 (the timeframe adopted by 
           the Royal Commission). For the first time, the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of 
           Australia will expand to include corporate crime, with the Governnmt pre oviding 
           $35.5 million to support this expansio n.The expansion of the Federal Cou rtand 
           additional  funding will ensure that those who engage in financial sector criminal 
           misconduct are prosecuted and face the appropriate punishment for their actions more 
           quickly. 
           To ensure that these reforms achieve lasting change, the Government will establish an 
           independent inquiry in three years that will assess whether industry has implemented 
           the recommendations of the Royal Commission.

                                         STATEMENT 2: ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 
                         OVERVIEW 
                         The fundamentals of the Australian economy remain sound. Employment growth has 
                         been strong, the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in more than seven years and 
                         the participation rate is at a near-record high. Non-mining business investment growth 
                         is solid  and economic growth is being supported by the r-ouoltl of major public 
                         infrastructure projects across the country. 
                         Real GDP is forecast to grow at around its estimated potential rate o2f¾   per cent in 
                         2019-20 and 2020-21, sustaining solid employment growth and supporting a pick-up in 
                         wage growth. Household consumption, business investment, public final demand and 
                         exports are all expected to contribute to growth. 
                         Internationally, there has been some loss of momentum in key economies including in 
                         the euro area, with the IMF and OECD revising down their growth projections for the 
                         global economy. However, global growth is expected to remain solid with strong 
                         labour market conditions evident across moasdt vanced economies. The Australian 
                         economy is expected to continue to benefit from growth in major trading partners, with 
                         economies in the Asian region growing relatively strongly. 
                         Accommodative monetary policy settings continue to support the domestice conomy, 
                         despite some evidence of tightening credit conditions anda  recent decline in housing 
                         prices, which appear to be weighing on activ.i tTyhe Australian dollar remainast  
                         levels which are supportive of growth – around one-third lower than the 2011 peak 
                         against the US dollar. 
                         Household consumption growth is expected to pick up over the forecast period, 
                         supported by continued growth in employment, increasing wage growth, historically 
                         low interest rates and the Government’s personal income tax relief measures, which 
                         have been further enhanced in this Budget. More than 1.2 million jobs have been 
                         created since September 2013, driving the unemployment rate down to its lowest level 
                         in  more than seven yea.rs  The participation rate is aa t near-record  high.  Solid 
                         employment growth is expected o tcontinue over the forecast period, with the 
                         unemployment rate forecast to be 5 per cent. As growth in the economy picks up and 
                         spare capacity in the labour market continues to beredu     ced, wage growth is expected 
                         to increase further. 
                         Non-mining business investment is forecast to record solid growstuhppo,             rted by 
                         historically low interest rates, while mining investment is expected to make its fir           st
                         positive contribution to real GDP growth in around seven year.s Public final demand 
                         will  also  contribute to growth  as the Government continues to proveide ssential 
                         services such as the National Disability Insurance S cheandm edeliver on its 
                         $100 billion infrastructure package. 
                                                                     2-3 
           Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
           Growth in exports in 2019-20 is expected to be supported by major liquefied natural 
           gas (LNG) projects ramping up production along with continuing strong demand for 
           education and travel services from Asia .Rural exports are expected to contribeu tt o 
           growth in 2019-20 on the basis of an assumed return to average seasonal conditions ,
           after detracting from growth in 2018-19 due to the drought. 
           Dwelling investment, while remaining at a high historical level, is expected to detract 
           from growth over the forecast period. The fall in housing prices accelerated over 2018 
           and continued into 2019, partly reflecting a rebalancing of supply and demand .As at 
           February 2019, capital city housing prices hadf allen by 8.6 per cent from their most 
           recent peak in September 2017. Price falls were largest in Sydney and Melbourne over 
           that period, although prices remain around 40 to 50 per cent higher in those cities 
           relative to their 2012 levels. 
           Nominal GDP is forecast to grow by  5per cent in 2018-19, 3¼ per cent in 2019-20 and 
           3¾ per cent in 2020-21. Nominal GDP growth is influenced by the terms of trade, 
           which have been supported recently by highe-thr an-assumed commodity prices, in 
           particular for iron ore and metallurgical coal. The terms of trade are forecast to fall in 
           2019-20, consistent with an assumed decline in key commodity prices. This is reflected 
           in a moderation in nominal GDP growth. 
           As  always  there are a number of risks and uncertainatireous nd  the forecasts. 
           Internationally, while some risks have lessened somewhat since the MYEFO, downside 
           risks remain around trade tensions, emerging market debt vulnerabilities and 
           geopolitical issues. The risks associated with Brexit have become more pronounced in 
           recent months, although Australia’s trade is oriented more towards Asia than Europe. 
           In the near term, there is also uncertainty associated with how quickly some of the 
           temporary factors that affected global growth in the second half of 2018, such as natural 
           disasters in Japan, will dissipate. 
           Domestically, uncertainty about the outlook for the housing market, in particular the 
           extent to which housing prices fall, poses a downside risk to the forecastsf or both 
           dwelling investment and consumption.A    more subdued outlook for household 
           income, or a further thteigning in credit conditions, could constrain household 
           spending amid high levels of household debt. In contrast, faster-than-expected wage or 
           employment growth could lead to household consumption growth being stronger than 
           forecast.  There are also uncertainties around the pace of recovery in rural exports 
           given that the outlook will depend on how weather conditions devel oapnd how the 
           sector recovers from recent drought and flood events. 
           The outlook for commodity prices is also a source of significant uncertainty for 
           nominal GDP. Consistent with recent practice, the assumptions for these prices remain 
           prudent. Further details on the effect of commodity price movements on nominal GDP 
           and revenue forecasts are discussed in Budget Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and 
           Scenario Analysis.

                                    metallurgical coal spot price falling over theye ar to reach US$150 per tonne FOB by the end of the 
                                    March quarter 2020; and the thermal coal spot price remaining at US$91 per tonne FOB. 
                               Note: The forecasts for the domestic economy are based on several technical assumptions. The exchange 
                                      rate is assumed to remain around its recent average level — a trade-weighted index of around 61 and 
                                      a US$ exchange rate of around 71 US cents. Interest rates are assumed to move broadly in line with 
                                      market expectations. World oil prices (Malaysian e asTapis) asumred to remain around 
                                      US$67 per barrel. Population growth is assumed to average around 1.7 per cent per year over the 
                                      forecast period.

                       Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
                       OUTLOOK FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 
                       Global  growth  strengthened in 2017 and into 2018, with a pic-upk  ina ctivity  in 
                       advanced, emerging market and developing eco nloemadiesing to an economic 
                       expansion estimated to be around 3.7 per cent in both of these years. oHwever, some 
                       moderation in growth occurred in the second half of 2018 as the expansion matured in 
                       the advanced economies, and as some emerging markets, such as Turkey and 
                       Argentina, experienced difficulties. Global growth is forecast to be 3½ per cent in 2019, 
                       2020 and 2021. 
                       A  slight downgrade to the forecast for global growth compared with the MYEFO 
                       largely reflects slowing growth outside of Australia’s major trading partn.ers Major 
                       trading partner growth is forecast to be 4 per cent in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Growth in 
                       Australia’s major trading partners has outpaced global growth over the past decade and 
                       this is expected to continue over the forecast horizon as growth in the Asian region 
                       remains relatively strong. 
                       Global labour market conditions continue to be robunset.mp Uloyment rates in the 
                       United States, euro area and Japan are all near record lows. There has been an increase 
                       in wage growth in the United States after a number of years of modest growth, 
                       reflecting the strong labour market, and wage growth has picked up in the euro area 
                       and Japan. US nonfa-rm labour productivity also rose solidly in 2018. Core inflation 
                       increased slightly in the US and the US Federal Reserve tightenmedone   tary policy 
                       through  2018. Inflation remains relatively contained in mjor aadvanced economies 
                       compared with historical experience. Headline inflation has eased in response to the 
                       decline in global oil prices between October and December 2018. 
                       There is a high degree of uncertainty around the global growth outlook amid a range of 
                       economic and geopolitical risks that continue to evolve. This uncertainty appears to be 
                       weighing on measures of global confidence, which have been falling in recent months. 
                       Some risks have lessened somewhat since the MYEFO, notably those from a further 
                       escalation in trade tensions between the US and China and those associated with 
                       tightening monetary policy. Others, such as risks around the Italian financial sector, 
                       are largely unchanged, while  the risks associated with Brexit have become more 
                       pronounced in recent months, noting that Australia’s trade is oriented more towards 
                       Asia than Europ.e In the near term, there is also uncertainty associated with how 
                       quickly some of the temporary factors that affected global growth in the second half of 
                       2018, such as natural disasters in Japan, will dissipate. 
                       There have been recent signs that an escalation of trade tensions between the US and 
                       China  is  less likely;  however,  trade policy uncertainty remains elevated between a 
                       number of economies and global trade growht has eased. This uncertainou  tlook for 
                       trade tensions has been weighing on confidence, new expordorerst   and investment 
                       intentions. Escalation of tensions would be expected to negatively affect growth in a 
                       number of countr ieinscluding in Australia’s majr to rading partners. Conversely, a 
                       resolution of tensions could result in global growth that is stronger than forecast. 
                                                               2-6 
                                                                                                            Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
                                Financial markets are now expecting monetary policy to remain accommodative or 
                                neutral for longer than previously. In particular, thei caindtion by the US Federal 
                                Reserve that it will be patient as it determines future policy adjustments helped stabilise 
                                financial markets. This has lessened the risks associated with emerging economy debt in 
                                the near term, but high debt levels in certain ecnomo ies and certain market segments 
                                remain a risk in the medium term. 
                                Over the longer term, unfavourable demographics will constrain potential growth rates 
                                in some of the world’s major economies. Slower productivity growth could also limit 
                                productive capacity in many countries. Future global productivity growth will depend 
                                on the dispersion of technology, the mobility of capital and the degree of openness and 
                                competition maintained across economies.

                                The United States economy continues to grow solidly. Most leading indicators remain 
                                favourable, suggesting that above-potential growth will be sustained in 2019, albeit at 
                                a slower pace as the effects of fiscal stimuluinis dsh. Tim he recent government 
                                shutdown is not expected to have a material impact on annual average growth rates, 
                                but will shift growth between quarters, with growth expected to pick up from the 
                                second quarter with the resumption of usual operations. Wage gowr th has picked up 
                                and inflation has increased slightly, closer to the target rate. 
                                Growth in China slowed to 6.6 per cent in 2018, consistent with the authorities’ target. 
                                The slowing largely reflected weaker domestic demand as authorities addressed risk s
                                in the financial system and trade pressures weighed on businessconf                             idence. These 
                                factors  are expected to continue to weigh on growth through 2019, despite some 
                                targeted support from macroeconomic policies. There are signs of weakness in China’s 
                                trade outlook, reflecting both trade tensions and a softer global outlook. Despite these 
                                factors, China is expected to meet the authorities’ target of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent growth in 
                                2019. A softening of growth is expected from 2021, reflecting the longer-term structural 
                                adjustments that China faces, including a declining working-age population. 
                                                                                       2-7 
           Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
           India experienced a moderation in growth in the second half of 2018, reflecting highe r
           global oil prices between August and October, tighter financial conditions andl ower 
           consumer sentiment. Considering these developments, the Reserve Bank of India cut 
           its policy rate and changed its policy stance to neutral in February. Further focus on 
           GST compliance, bringing more firms into the formal economy, and progress on 
           non-performing asset resolutions are expected to lift growth outcomes for 2020 and 
           2021. Looking forward, India’s economic growth will depend on  refitsorm agenda 
           following the national elections in the first half of 2019. 
           Japan’s  growth is expected to pick up slight liyn 2019 to1  per cent following a 
           disrupted 2018. However, a planned increase in val-uaedded tax in October 2019 is 
           expected to weigh on private consumption. Real GDP growth is forecast to moderate 
           in 2020 as capacity constraints become more binding, despite a small boost in demand 
           from hosting the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Alongsia des teady tightening of labour 
           market conditions and accommodative monetary policy settings, wage growth ha  s
           picked up over the past few years .Core inflation is positive but continues to remain 
           more muted than expected given the tightening in labour market conditions. 
           Growth in the euro areas lowed in late 2018. While some temporary factors weighed 
           on growth, such as political uncertainty as well as revised auto emission standards and 
           drought in Germany, there was also a broad-based weakening in momentum which is 
           expected to persist in the near term. Industrial output has softened, owing to reduced 
           external demand and weaker trade growth. Sentiment across the region has also been 
           easing, which is expected to weigh on business investment going forw. Oardn the 
           other hand, domestic demand is expected to be supported by historically low interest 
           rates, improved labour market conditions and slightly expansionary fiscal policy. 
           Ongoing uncertainty related tgoe opolitical  factors, the threat of protectionism, 
           management of financial sector risks in Italy and continued uncertainty over Brexit, 
           including the possibility of the UnitedKi  ngdom leaving the European Union without 
           an agreement in place, remain risks for euro area growth. 
           ASEAN-5  economies continue to perform solidly, with domestic demand and 
           favourable demographics supporting growth. The near-term risks associated with the 
           withdrawal of supportive monetary policy settings globally hvea eased somewhat. 
           However, the ASEA-5N economies face some challenges this year, including

                            OUTLOOK FOR THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY 
                            Outlook for real GDP growth 
                            The fundamentals of the Australian economy remain sound. Real GDP is forecast to 
                            grow at around its estimated potential r aofte 2¾ per cent in 201-209  and 2020-21 
                            (Chart  1). Household consumption, business investment, public final demand and 
                            exports are all expected to contribuet to growth. Following declines in housing prices 
                            and building approval,s partly in response to a rebalancing in supply and demand  ,
                            dwelling investment is expected to detract from growth. 
                            Solid employment growth is expected to continue over the forecast period and the 
                            unemployment rate is forecast to be 5 per cent. Wage growth is expected to pick up as 
                            growth in the economy strengthens and spare capacity in the labour market continues 
                            to be reduced.

                            Households 
                            Household consumption growth moderated in the second hal fof 2018. Consumption 
                            of discretionary items was particularly soft, including fort hose that relate to housing 
                            market conditions, such as household furnishings and motor vehicl (eCshart 2). The 
                            forecast for consumption growth has been downgraded t2¼o  per cent in 201819- . 
                            However, household consumption growth is forecast to pick  upto  2¾ per cent  in 
                            2019-20 and 3 per cent in 2020-21, underpinned by continued growth in employment 
                            and increasing wage growth. Household disposable income and consumption growth 
                            are also expected to be supported by continued low interest rates and the 
                            Government’s personal income tax relief measures, which have been further enhanced 
                            in this Budget. The household saving ratio is expected to be broadly steady over the 
                            forecast period. 
                                                                            2-9 
                          Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
                          There is uncertainty, however, about the extent to which the outlook for the housing 
                          market  will influence overall household  consumption (Box  1).  Housing price falls 
                          accelerated over 2018 and have continued into 201.9 As at February 2019, capital city 
                          housing prices had fallen by 8.6 per cent from their most recent peak in 
                          September 2017. Price falls were largest in Sydney and Melbourne over that period, 
                          although prices remain around 40 to 50 per cent higher in those cities relative to 2012. 
                          The price falls partly reflect an increase in housing supply in recent years following a 
                          period of under-building relative to population growth. Demand hasa lso declined 
                          from a tightening in credit conditions, including from macro-prudential measures to 
                          address credit quality, and a reduction in demand from overseas buyers. 
                          A  more subdued outlook for household income, or a further tightening in credit 
                          conditions could constrain household spending amid high levels of household debt. By 
                          contrast, faster-than-expected wage or employment growth could lead to household 
                          consumption being stronger than forecast. The sensitivity of the forecasts to changes in 
                          household consumption is discussed in Budget Statement 7.

                                   Housing price declines have also affected the outlook for dwelling investmen. tAs at 
                                   January 2019, residential building approvals had fallen by almost 40 per cent relative 
                                   to late 2017, with the fall concentrated in higher-density projects (Chart 3). Liaison with 
                                   industry suggests thats ofter  investment  intentions reflect both tighter credit 
                                   conditions and a weakening in sentiment amongst buyers. Nonetheless, a 
                                   compositional shift towards highe-rdensity dwellings, which can take almost three 
                                   times as long as houses to complete, has resulted in  asolid pipeline of work yet to be 
                                   done. This pipeline of work is expected to support dwelling investment activity in 
                                   2018-19, with forecast growth of ½ per cent, following average annual growth of 
                                   5.5 per cent over the previous five years. Dwelling investment is then forecast to fall by 
                                   7 per cent in 2019-20 and by a further  4per cent in 202-021 as existing projects are

           Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
           Net exports 
           Exports are forecast to grow by 4 per cent in 20192-0, driven by mining and services 
           exports. Mining exports are forecast to grow by 4½ per cent as major liquefied natural 
           gas (LNG) projects ramp up production, and services exports are forecast to grow by 
           4½ per cent as demand from Asia continues to support tourism and education exports. 
           Rural exports are forecast to increase by 2½ per cent in 2019-20 on the basis of a return 
           to average seasonal conditions following the drou-agffehtcted fall of 8 per cent in 
           2018-19. However, growth in rural exports and farm production overal wl ill depend 
           on how weather conditions develop and how the sector recovers from recent drought 
           and flood events (Box 3). 
           Export growth is forecast to slow t1½o  per cent in 202-201, largely as growth in 
           mining exports slow.s Iron ore export volumes are expected to have increased by 
           12 per cent over the five years to 2020-21, while LNG export volumes are expected to 
           have doubled. Recent high bulk commodity prices which have arisaesn  a result of 
           global supply issues are not expected to generate a significant supply response from 
           Australian producers — there is little spare capacity in the domestic marketa t present 
           and prices are not expected to be sustained for as ufficiently long period to warrant a 
           significant expansion of capacity. Mining exports are forecast to grow by ½ per cent in 
           2020-21, while services exports are forecast to grow by 3½ per cent and rural exports 
           by 4 per cent. 
           Imports  are expected to grow moderately over the forecast period, with capital 
           imports forecast to grow at rates slower than those experienced recently, given that the 
           investment phase for the remaining major LNG projects is close to complete. Imports 
           are forecast to grow by 3 per cent in 2019-20 and 2½ per cent in 2020-21.

                          As economic growth strengthens and spare capacity in the labour market continues to 
                          be reduced, wage growth is expected to pick up to 2¾ per cent through the year to the 
                          June quarter 2020 and 3¼ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2021. Growth in 
                          the Wage Price Index was 2.3 per cent through the year to the December quarter 2018, 
                          its equal strongest outcome i nmore than three years. All states and territories and 
                          most industries recorded higher wage growth compared with a year ago. In Australia, 
                          as in other advanced economies, the response of wages to improving labour market 
                          conditions has been slower and more muted than in past cycles. This is partly 
                          explained by lower inflation expectations and sparec apacity in the labour market as 
                          indicated by broader measures of labour underutilisation. Strong employment growth 
                          has also drawn people into the labour market who were not previously looking for 
                          work. In Australia, slower wage growth also reflects adjustments associated with the 
                          unwinding of the terms of trade boom. 
                                                                      2-18 
                                                                                Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
                       Consumer price inflation has eased a little over recent quarters and was 1 .pe8 r cent 
                       through the year to the December quarter 2018. A slowing in administered price 
                       inflation, partly reflecting child care policy changes and lower growth in electricity 
                       prices, has  contributed to softe rinflation recently. Housing prices, including both 
                       dwelling rents and the cost of building a new dwelling, have also contributed to lower 
                       inflation. In contrast, the depreciation of the Australian dollar and associated increase 
                       in tradable inflation has put upward pressure on prices over the past year. In the near 
                       term,  lower petrol prices  are  expected to reduce inflation.  Inflation is expected to 
                       increase  over the forecast period as growth in the economy picks up spandare  
                       capacity in the labour market continues to be reducedC.ons    umer price inflation is 
                       forecast to be 2¼ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2020 and 2½ per cent 
                       though the year to the June quarter 2021. 
                       Outlook for nominal GDP growth 
                       Nominal GDP is forecast to grow by 5 per cent in 2018-19, 3¼ per cent in 2019-20 and 
                       3¾ per cent in 2020-21 (Chart 6). The moderation in growth in 2019-20 reflects a fall in 
                       the terms of trade as key commodity prices are assumed to decline to more sustainable 
                       levels.  This is partially offset by a p-iuckp in real GDP growth and in wag eand 
                       domestic price growth. 
                       The level of nominal GDP is expected to be aro4u2n.d $7 billion lower over the 
                       four years to 2022-23 compared with the 201819-  MYEFO, with downgrades to the 
                       outlook for compensation of employees, non-mining profits and gross mixed income. 
                       This is partially offset by an upgrade to the outlook for mining profits.

                           Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
                           Wage and price growth are expected to increase over the forecast horizon reflecting the 
                           pick-up in economic growth and the continued reductofion  spare capacity in the 
                           labour market. If inflation and wage growth outcomes are lower than forecast, slower 
                           nominal GDP growth would constrain taxation receipts, though this will be partially 
                           offset by a fall in payments. For example, if inflation outcomes were ½ of a percentage 
                           point lower in each of 2019-20 and 2020-21, the direct impact on the level of nominal 
                           GDP could result in it being around 0 pe.8r cent lower than forecast by 202-210 , 
                           resulting in a deterioration in the underlying cash balance of around2. $7 billion by 
                           2020-21. 
                           The terms of trade are expected to support nominal GDP growth in 2-109,18 but to 
                           detract from growth in 20192-0. The near-term strength in the terms of trade reflec ts
                           higher iron ore and metallurgical coal prices. The terms of trade are expected to fal lin 
                           2019-20, as supply and demand rebalance in these markets (Chart 7). The assumptions 
                           regarding commodity prices are supported by comprehensive market and industry 
                           consultation undertaken by Treasury. There is greater uncertainty than usual around 
                           commodity prices as a result of heightened price volatiyli at nd policies in China and 
                           Brazil.  As such, a prudent approach to the bulk commodity price assumptions 
                           continues to be appropriate.

                           The iron ore price remained relatively steady during much of 20,1 b8 ut the tailings 
                           dam collapse in Brazil resulted in thep  rice reaching its highest level since early 2017. 
                           There are a wide range of market estimates around the impact of the dam collapse and 
                           subsequent policy actions in Brazil on the global supply of iron ore. Consultation by 
                           Treasury highlighted a relatively common view that the iron ore price will remain 
                           elevated over the next four quarters, and that the spot price is expected to decline as 
                           supply-side issues are addressed. As such, the iron ore price is assumed to decline over 
                                                                          2-20 
                                     Statement 2: Economic Outlook 
           the year to reach US$55 per tonne free-on-board (FOB) by the end of the March quarter 
           2020. Some market and industry participants have highlighted a risk that prices could 
           remain high for an even longer period of time. 
           The metallurgical coal price remained high during 2018, with an average price of over 
           US$200 per tonne FOB. Market and industry consultation undertaken by Treasury 
           supports the view that pricse will decline from recent highs, but that the MYEFO 
           assumption of a decline in the price to US$120 per tonne FOB is now too low. The 
           metallurgical coal price has averaged around US$ 2pe00r tonne since the 201-167 
           MYEFO (when the US$120 per tonne assumption was first implemented) and wa slast 
           below US$120 per tonne in August 2016. As such, consistent with market and industry 
           participants’ views, the metallurgical coal price is assumed to decline over the year to 
           reach US$150 per tonne FOB by the end of the March quarter 2020. 
           During 2018 ,the thermal coal spot price ranged from around US$90 per tonne to 
           US$125 per tonne. The thermal coal price was affected by both supply and demand 
           factors during the year, including constrained supply of hi-gghrade Australian coal 
           and unseasonably hot weahter in China in the middle of the yearT. he thermal coal 
           price is assumed to remain around recent levels o UfS$91 per tonne FOB over the 
           forecast period, which is close to the MYEFO assumption of US$93 per tonne FOB. 
           Policies affecting clearances at Chinese ports, however, are a source of uncertainty for 
           coal prices. 
           Commodity prices are volatile and the outlook for commodity prices remains a key 
           uncertainty in the outlook for nominal GDP (Box 4).  
           Box 4: Sensitivity analysis of the iron ore and metallurgical coal spot prices 
           Movements in commodity prices can have significant effects on nominal GDP and 
           Commonwealth government tax revenue. The analysis below provides an indication 
           of the direct impacts on nominal GDP and company tax receipts of altering the timing 
           around the iron ore and metallurgical coal price assumptions. 
           If the iron ore price was to fall immediately to USpe$5r 5t onne FOB, four quarters 
           earlier than assumed, nominal GDP could be around $5.8 billion lower than forecast in 
           2018-19 and $10.6b illion lower in 2019-20.  This would result in a decrease in tax 
           receipts of around $0.5 billion in 201-819, $2.6 billion in 2019-20 and $1.0 billion in 
           2020-21 (Table A). 
           By contrast, if the iron ore price was to remain elevated for four quarters longer than 
           currently assumed, before falling immediately to US$55 per tonne FOB, nominal GDP 
           could be around $0.8 billion higher than forecast in 2018-19 and $15.5 billion higher in 
           2019-20.  This would result in an increase in tax receipts of around $0.1 billion in 
           2018-19, $2.0 billion in 2019-20 and $2.1 billion in 2020-21.

              The growth rate of potential GDP is estimated to be 2per¾  cent over the next few 
              years.  As spare capacity is absorbed, productivity and loaubr market variables — 
              including employment and the participation rate —a re assumed to converge to their 
              potential levels. To absorb the spare capacity in the economy, real GDP from 2021-22 is 
              then projected to grow faster than potential at 3 per cent. By the end of 2025-26 spare 
              capacity is absorbed and real GDP is projected to grow at its potential rate thereafter. 
              Potential GDP is estimated based on an analysis of underlying trends for population, 
              productivity and participation. In the long run, estimates of participation are affected 
              by demographic factors, including the ageing of the population, while productivity is 
              assumed to grow at its 30-year average rate. The unemployment rate is projected to be 
              5 per cent consistent with estimates of taccehele nonrating in- flatio  nrate of 
              unemployment (NAIRU). Inflation is projected to be 2½ per cent, consistent with the 
              mid-point of the RBA’s medium-term target band. The terms of trade are projected to 
              remain flat at around their 2005 level from 2022-23. For a discussion of the sensitivity 
              of the GDP growth projections to estimates of potential output, see

               STATEMENT 3: FISCAL STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK 
             After more than a decade of budget deficits, the Government is delivering a surplus 
             in 2019-20, reflecting a sound  economy and the  Government’s  prudent fisca l
             management.  The budget position will continue to improve with sustained 
             surpluses projected to exceed 1 per cent of GDP in the medium term. 
             The Government’s continued focus on spending restraint has ensured that 
             surpluses are being delivered while at the same time providinlgow  er taxes for 
             hard-working Australians, and guaranteeing the essential services Australians rely 
             on. 
             The Government will bring the payments-to-GDP ratio down to below historical 
             averages from 2019-20 onwards. Tax receipts as a share of GDP are expected t obe 
             23.3 per cent in 2019-20 and remain below th  Goevernment’s 23.9 per cent 
             tax-to-GDP cap until 2029-30. 
             As the budget returns to surplus, the Government will focus on strengthening the 
             balance sheet through public debt reduction to ensure the longer-term sustainability 
             of the budge.t Paying down public debt ensurs ethat the Government is better 
             equipped to deal with future challenges and reduces the burden of debt on future 
             generations. 
             Net debt is expected to decline i  eanch year of the forwdar estimates and the 
             medium term and is projected to be eliminated by 2029-30. 
             Gross debt is expected to be 27.9 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 and is projected to fall 
             below its 30 year average to 12.8 per cent of GDP by the end of the medium term.

                           OVERVIEW 
                           After a decade of deficits, the budget is returning to surplus- i20 wn 2i0th1 9an 
                           underlying cash surplus of $7.1 billion, equal to 0.4 per cent of GDPS. urpluses are 
                           expected to build across the forward estimates period, with cumulative surpluses of 
                           $45 billion expected over this period.  
                           The net operating balance is expected to be in surplus for a second consecutive year, 
                           with a surplus of $12.9 billion expected in 2019-20 and sustainable surpluses expected 
                           across the forward estimates. Budget aggregates are shown in Table 1.

                           The Government remains focused on controlling growth in government spending. As 
                           a proportion of GDP, payments are forecast to fall below the historical average of 
                           24.7 per cent from 2019-20. Real growth in spending is expected to average 1.9 per cent 
                           between 2013-14 and 2022-23, the lowest of any government in 50 years. 
                           The Government has continued to pursue saving to ms             ake room for new spending 
                           priorities. Since 2013-14, the Government has implemented savings measures with a 
                           combined effect of more than $200 billion through to 2022-23.   
                           The Government has charted a responsible path back to surplus with the total 
                           turnaround in the underlying cash balance between 201-314 and 2019-20 expected to 
                           be $55.5 billion, or 3.4 per cent of GDP, as shown in Chart 1.

                             As the budget returns to surplus, the Governm ewntill focus on strengthening the 
                             balance sheet and public debt reduction to ensure the sustainability of the budget. 
                             Paying down debt ensures the Government is better equipped to deal with future 
                             challenges and reduces the burden of debt on future generations. 
                             Net debt is expected to decline in each year of the forward estimates and the medium 
                             term, falling from 18 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to a projected zero per cent by 2029-30. 
                             Net financial worth is expected to improve from 2–4.3 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 to 
                             -19.7 per cent of GDP in 202-223, before improving further to -3.3 per cent of GDP in 
                             2029-30.  
                             Gross debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to decline in each year of the forward 
                             estimates and the medium term, falling from 27 .p9er cent in 2019-20 to a projected 
                             12.8 per cent of GDP by 2029-30, below the 30 year average of around 15 per cent.  
                             FISCAL STRATEGY 
                             The fiscal strategy underlies the Government’s commitment to investing in Australia’s 
                             future by strengthening the economy while keeping taxes low and guaranteeing 
                             essential services. 
                             The Government’s fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses, on average, over the 
                             course of the economic cycle. Reaching surplus in 2019-20 after a decade of deficits has 
                             required strong fiscal discipline and consistently pursuing a strategy of budget repair. 
                             As the budget returns to surplus in 20-1290, and with surpluses projected over the 
                             medium term, the Government will focus son trengthening the balance sheet and 
                             reducing debt. 
                                                                                3-6 
                                  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy & Outlook 
           Maintaining debt at prudent levels is an important element of improving the strenthg  
           and sustainability of the Government’s financial position. It provides the Government 
           with flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions and also ensures that 
           future generations are not burdened by excessive debt from past government 
           spending. 
           The Government is continuing to reduce government borrowing as a share of the 
           economy over time. Both net debt and gross debt are falling as a share of the economy 
           across the forward estiamtes  and medium term. The Government is on track to 
           eliminate net debt by 2029-30. Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities provides 
           further information on the Government’s debt, assets and liabilities. 
           The Government remains focused on managing the budget responsibly and 
           supporting a stronger economy, through policies that drive earnings and economic 
           growth.  Consistent with the fiscal strategy, the Government is continuing to invest in 
           quality infrastructure to boost growth and productivity. The Government will 
           continue to control growth in government spending and offset new measures with 
           reductions in spending from elsewhere in the budget.   
           The Government’s tax-to-GDP cap of 23.9 per cent is a key part of its plan to support 
           stronger economic growth.  The cap ensures the Government lives within its means by 
           not imposing an increasing tax burden on Australians over time, which would 
           adversely affect growth, costing jobs and investment. The 23.9 per cent cap represents 
           the average level of tax receipts following the introduction of the GST and prior to the 
           onset of the Global Financial Crisis. 
           A sound budget has allowed the Government to deliver record spending on essential 
           services without increasing taxes, while still providing the flexibility to respond to 
           challenges as they arise. 
           The Government’s fiscal strategy is consistent with the requirements of the Charter o  f
           Budget Honesty Act 1998 and is set out in Box 1.

                                  Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy & Outlook 
                                    Box 1: The Government’s fiscal strategy 
                                    Medium-term fiscal strategy 
                                    The Government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses  , 
                                    on average, over the course of the economic cycle. The fiscal strategy underlines the 
                                    commitment to budget disciplinea nd outlines how the Government will set 
                                    medium-term fiscal policy while allowing for flexibility in response to changing 
                                    economic conditions. 
                                    The strategy is underpinned by the following four policy elements: 
                                    •   investing in a stronger economy by redirecting Government spending to quality 
                                        investment to boost productivity and workforce participation; 
                                    •   maintaining strong fiscal discipline by controlling expenditure to reduce the 
                                        Government’s share of the economy over time in order to free up resources for 
                                        private investment to drive jobs and economic growth, with: 
                                        −  the payments-to-GDP ratio falling; 
                                        −  stabilising and then reducing net debt over time; 
                                    •   supporting revenue growth by supporting policies that drive earnings and 
                                        economic growth, while: 
                                        −  maintaining a sustainable tax burden consistent with the economic growth 
                                             objective, including through maintaining the t-atox-GDP ratio at or below 
                                             23.9 per cent of GDP; and 
                                    •   strengthening the Government’s balance sheet by improving net financial worth 
                                        over time. 
                                    Budget repair strategy 
                                    The budget repair strategy is designed to deliver sustainable budget surpluses 
                                    building to at least 1 per cent of GDP as soon as possible, consistent with the 
                                    medium-term fiscal strategy. 
                                    The strategy sets out that:

                            The Government’s continued focus on spending restraint has contributed to the 
                            budget returning to surplus. Compared with the 2-19018 Budget, total nominal 
                            payments estimates are lower in each year of the forward estimates and $21 .b2illion 
                            lower in total over the four years from 2019-20. The payments-to-GDP ratio is expected 
                            to be 24.6 per cent in 2019-20, falling to 24.5 per cent from 20212-2, below the 30y  ear 
                            average of 24.7 per cent. As a result of decisions to control growth in government 
                            spending, average annual real growth in payments over the four years from 2019-20 is 
                            expected to be 1.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent over the period since the Government was 
                            elected in 2013 – the lowest of any Commonwealth government in 50 years. 
                            Since the 2016 election, the Government has implemented around $62 billion of budget 
                            repair measures that have strengthened the budget position. These structural savings 
                                                                            3-9

                           continue to improve the spending growth trajectory over time, which is making room 
                           for new spending priorities and is keeping taxes to the minimum necessary to deliver 
                           essential government services while maintaining surpluses. 
                           The Government is continuing to pursue savings to ensre tu he Budget remains on a 
                           sustainable trajectory for the future. Taking into account reductions in payments aa s 
                           result of non-economic parameters and other variations, the net impact of decisions in 
                           the 2019-20 Budget on payments is a reduction of $982 million over the four years from 
                           2019-20. This is consistent with the Government’s fiscal strategy that new spending 
                           measures will be more than offset by reductions in spending elsewhere in twithhe 
                           budget.

                           The Government is committed to continuing to work with the Parliament to secure the 
                           successful passage of unlegislated measures that contribute to the task of budget 
                           repair. The estimated impact over the forward estimates of remaining budget repair 
                           measures, announced prior to the 2-2001 B9 udget and after taking account of 
                           parameter changes, is now positive $5 .bi7 llion. This comprises around $ 5billion of 
                           receipt increases and around $0.7 billion of payment saves.  
                           Forecast tax receipts have been revised down by $1 8b.i2llion over the four years to 
                           2022-23. The revisions have been driven by parameter and other variations and policy 
                           decisions, including the Government’s measure  Lowtaxees fr                       or ha-wrdorking 
                           Australians: Building on the Personal Income Tax Plan. 
                           Policy decisions are expected to reduce tax receipts by $3.2 billion over the four years 
                           to 2022-23. This includes the impact of the Government’s decision to ovpidre 
                           additional tax relief, partly offset by the decision to extend and expand the Australian 
                           Taxation Office’s Tax Avoidance Taskforce. 
                           Excluding policy decisions, tax receipts have been revised down by $15 billion over the 
                           four years to 2022-23, as revisions to the outlook for household consumption, dwelling 
                           investment and average wages weigh on the forecasts. In the near term, however, this 
                           impact will be more than offset by an increase in company tax collections in 2-01918 
                           and 2019-20, reflecting the recent observed strength in commodity prices.

                       the benefit provided through the low and middle income tax offset (LMITO) from the 
                       year it is removed. The benefit of theth  reshold change will be received by taxpayers 
                       throughout the 2022-23 income year (and later years). In addition, low-  and 
                       middle-income taxpayers will receive their final LMITO in 2022-23 after they lodge 
                       their tax returns for the 2021-22 income year. This results in a larger cash impact in 
                       2022-23.  
                       Projections of the underlying cash balance over the medim teu  rm reflect additional 
                       personal income tax relief in the Budget, including the reduction in the 32.5 per cent 
                       rate to 30 per cent for incomes between $45,000 and $200,000 in 202425- (as shown in 
                       Table 4). This is partially offset by lower payments, which drive an improvement in the 
                       underlying cash balance by the end of the medium term. Lower payment projections 
                       have been driven by lower than expected payments across a range of programs in the 
                       forward estimates flowing through to the medium term. These include lower income 
                       support payments as recipients take advantage of stronger labour market conditions, 
                       reducing their dependence on government programs. It also includes the benefits from 
                                                              3-11

                              Box 2: Impact of lower personal income taxes in the medium term 
                              The Government will lower taxes for hard-working Australians by building on its 
                              legislated Personal Income Tax Plan. 
                              The legislated Personal Income Tax Plan and these changes are fiscally affordable over 
                              the forward estimates and medium-term, with the underlying cash balance returning 
                              to surplus in 2019-20 and sustained surpluses projected over the medium term.  
                              The projections for the medium-term tax receipts take into account all Government 
                              policy, including the additional personal income tax relief in this year’s Budg. Thet e 
                              Government is to deliver additional personal income tax relief, which is expected to 
                              reduce tax receipts by $158 billion over the medium term.

                           The face value of AGS on issue (gross debt) is projected to rise from56 $0 billion in 
                           2019-20 to $569 billion by the end of the forward estimat eAs.s a percentage of the 
                           economy, gross debt peaked at 28.8 per cent of GDP($ 531.9 billion) in 2017-18 and is 
                           expected to fall in 201920-  to 27.9 per cent ($560 billion) and continue falling across 
                           every year of the forward estimates to 25 per cent ($569 billion) in 2022-23. Gross debt 
                           is then projected to continue to fall to around 12.8 per cent of GDP ($41 6b.il8lion) by 
                           2029-30, below the 30 year average.   
                           The projected fall in gross debt is largely driven by the improvement in the underlying 
                           cash balance. 
                           Gross debt levels over the medium term also reflect the Government’s decision not to 
                           draw  down on the Future Fund’s earnings to meet unfunded superannuation 
                           liabilities.

                           Net financial worth is an indicator of fiscal sustainability. It provides a broader 
                           measure of the Government’s assets and liabilities as it includes both the assets of the 
                           Future Fund and the public sector superannuation liability that the Future Fund seeks 
                           to finance. 
                           Net financial worth is expected to improve in every year over the forward estimates. 
                           Net financial worth is estimated to be $-488 billion (-24.3 per cent of GDP) in 2019-20, 
                           $20.9 billion lower than estimated at the 201198- MYEFO.  Compared with the 
                           2018-19 MYEFO, net financial worth has decreasoedver t              he forward estimates to 
                           2022-23. This primarily reflects a rise in the market value of AGS due to lower yields.

                          in the underyling cash balance since the 280-119 MYEFO and the 2018-19 Budget.  
                          Since the 2018-19 Budget, the underlying cash balance has improved in every year in 
                          the forward estimates and medium term. 
                          Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, policy decisions have reduced the underlying cashb alance 
                          by $10.4 billion in the four years from 2019-20 to 2022-23. 
                          Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, the effect of parameter and other variations has resulted in a

                                  Receipts estimates 
                                  Total receipts are expected to be 497$  million lower in 2019-20 than estimated at the 
                                  2018-19 MYEFO, with tax receipts250 $  million  lower  and nonta-xation receipts 
                                  $248 million lower. 
                                  Policy decisions 
                                  Policy decisions since the 20-1189 MYEFO are expected to reduce tax receipts by 
                                  $1 billion in 201-920 and $3.2 billion over the fo yeaurrs to 2022-23. Significant 
                                  measures include: 
                                  •    Lower taxes for hard-working Australians: Building on the Personal Income Tax Plan. This 
                                       measure, which will provide additional tax relief of $19.5 billion over the four years 
                                       to 2022-23, reduces tax receipts by $5.7 billion, owing to the inclusion of a provision 
                                       in the 2018-19 MYEFO. 
                                  •    ATO Tax Avoidance Taskforce – funding of $1 billion will extend the Taskforce’s 
                                       operation until 30 June 2023 and expand its activities.T he Taskforce will target the 
                                       tax affairs of multinationals, large public and private groups, trusts, high wealth 
                                       individuals and other high tax risk sector. sThis measure is estimated to increase 
                                       tax receipts by $3.1 billion over the forward estimates period.

                                  Parameter and other variations 
                                  Parameter and other variations are expectedt o reduce tax receipts by $1 5billion over 
                                  the four years to 20222-3. Expected GST receipts have been revised down since the 
                                  2018-19 MYEFO in line with downward revisions to the forecasts for gro  wth in
                                  consumption and dwelling investment. The revisions to the outlook for average wages 
                                  and nonfar-m gross mixed income have also weighed on forecast receipts for 
                                  individuals and other withholding taxes. In the near term, however, this impact will 
                                  be more than offset by an increase in company tax collections in 201-819 and 2019-20, 
                                  reflecting the recent observed strength in commodity prices.

                      Payment estimates 
                      Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, total cash payments have decreased by $4 billion in 2019-20 
                      and decreased by $20 billion over the four years to 2022-23. 
                      Policy decisions 
                      The overall net impact of payment related decisions (after taking account of reductions 
                      as a result of nonec- onomic parameter and other variations) has decreased total cash 
                      payments by $982 million over the four years to 2022-23.  
                      Major increases in payments as a result of policy decisions since the 20-1189 MYEFO 
                      include: 
                      •  funding to strengthen priamry care and improve frontline health services for 
                         Australians, including the reintroduction of indexation to all remaining General

                         increase payments by $146 million in 201920- ($995 million over the four years to 
                         2022-23);

                         and Exploitation of People with Disability, which is expected to increase payments by 
                         $191 million in 2019-20 ($521 million over the four years to 2022-23);

                         each week for children attending preschool in 2020, which is expected to increase 
                         payments by $136 million in 2019-20 ($454 million over the two years to 2020-21).

                                       expected to decrease by $1.8 billion in 201-920 ($7.3 billion over the three years to 
                                       2021-22), consistent with a reduction in GST receipts;

                                       expected to decrease in net term bsy $1.6 billion in 201-920 ($1.6 billion over the 
                                       four  years to 202223-), largely reflecting the slower than expected transition of 
                                       participants into the NDIS. This includes a decrease in receipts in relation to State 
                                       and Territory contributions to the NDIS and increases in other Australian 
                                       Government disability programs, as the Australian Government ensures clients yet

                                       largely reflecting continued reductions in recipient numbers as a result of 
                                       previously announced Government policies aimed at improving the targeting of 
                                       payments to those most in need, including the ongoing impact of the prevslioy u

                                       largely reflecting the lower-than-expected cost of servicing Australian Government

                                       reflecting lower-than-expected recipient numbers and higher recipient earnings 
                                       reducing average payment rates, resulting from more students moving into work.

                                  Revenue estimates 
                                  Changes in accrual revenue are generally driven by the same factors as cash receipts, 
                                  though differences arise where revenue raised in aen g yievar is not received in 
                                  that year. 
                                  Expense estimates 
                                  Movements in expenses over the forward estimates are broadly similar to the 
                                  movements in cash payments. The key exceptions include: 
                                  •    superannuation benefits, where there is a timing difference with the expense 
                                       accruing during employment and cash payments occurring during retirement; and 
                                  •    purchases of non-financial assets, which are included in cash payments but not in 
                                       accrual expenses. The expense estimates include depreciation o-ffin naonncial 
                                       assets rather than recognising the impact at the time of purchase. 
                                  Detailed information on expenses can be found in Statement  5: Expenses and 
                                  Net Capital Investment. 
                                  Headline cash balance estimates 
                                  The headline cash balance consists of the underlying cash balance, net cash flows from 
                                  investments in financial assets for policy purposes (for example, the equity funding of 
                                  the Australian Rail Track Corporation) and net Future Fund earnings. Table 9 provides 
                                  further detail of differences between the underlying and headline cash balance 
                                  estimates of the Australian Government general government sector. 
                                  The headline cash balance f2or01 9-20  is  estimated to be a deficit of $ 4b.ill4 ion, 
                                  compared with a deficit of $7.2 billion at the 2018-19 MYEFO. The improvement in the 
                                  headline cash balance since the 28-190 1MYEFO  is  primarily driven by  the 
                                  improvement in the underlying cash balance.

                             Structural budget balance estimates 
                             The structural budget balance estimates seek to remove cyclical economic factors that 
                             can have a temporary impact on revenues and expenditures, such as the extent to 
                             which economic output deviates from its potential level and fluctuations in commodity 
                             prices, asset prices and the rate of unemployment.   
                             Considered in conjunction with other measures, estimates of the structural budget 
                             balance can provide broad insights into the sustainability of current fiscal settings. 
                             Over the last decade and within the forward estimates period, estimates of the 
                             structural budget balance are generally lower than the underlying cash balance. This is 
                             because commodity prices have generally been higher than their estimated lo-nrugn 
                             levels and have outweighed the measured effect of other cyclical factors.    
                             The structural budget balance improves over the forward estimates and medium term, 
                             as shown in Chart 8.

                             In 2017-18, net cash flows from recurrent activities were in surplus for the first time 
                             since the Global Financial Crisis, and are expected to remain positive over the forward 
                             estimates. As the budget returns to surplus in 202190, t- he positive cash flow from 
                             recurrent activities will increasingly contribute to funding capital spending, reducing 
                             the Government’s borrowing requirement. From 2020-21 onwards, the surplus from

                         Compared with the 201189- MYEFO, the 2019-20 Budget forecasts for tax receipts 
                         have been revised dow nby $18.2 billion  over the four years  to 2022-23.  The 
                         revisions have been driven by parameter and other variations, and policy decisions, 
                         including the Government’s measure  Lower taxes for hard-working Australians: 
                         Building on the Personal Income Tax Plan. 
                         Parameter and other variations are expected to reduce tax receipts by1 $5.0 billion 
                         over the four years to 20-2322, asr evisions to theou tlook for household 
                         consumption, dwelling investment and average wages weigh on the foreca.s Ints  
                         the near term, however, this impcat will be more than offset by an increase in 
                         company tax collections in 2-019 an18    d 201920- , reflecting the recent observed 
                         strength in commodity prices. 
                         Expected GST receipts have been revised down since the 2018-19 MYEFO, including 
                         by $1.8  billion in 2190 -20,  in line with downward revisions ttho e  forecasts for 
                         growth in consumption and dwelling investment. Relative to the 201819-  MYEFO, 
                         lower forecasts for average wages and non-farm gross mixed income have also 
                         weighed on forecast receipts for individuals and other withholding taxes. 
                         Policy decisions taken since the 2018-19 MYEFO are expected to reduce tax receipts 
                         by $3.2  billion over thef our years  to 2022-23.  This includes the impact of the 
                         Government’s  measure  Lower  taxes for har-dworking Australians: Building on the 
                         Personal Income Tax Plan. This measure, which will provide additional tax relief o f
                         $19.5 billion over the four years to 202223- , reduces tax receipts by $5.7 billion over 
                         the four years to 202223,-  owing  to the inclusion of a provision in the 
                         2018-19 MYEFO. The Government’s decision to extend and expand the Australian 
                         Taxation Office’s Tax Avoidance Taskforce increases tax receipts.  
                         In 2019-20, tax receipts as a share of GDP are expected to be 233. per cent, similar to 
                         the 2018-19 MYEFO estimate. Tax receipts as a share of GDP are expected to remain 
                         below the Government’s 23.9 per cent tax-to-GDP cap until 2029-30.

                          OVERVIEW 
                          Since the 2018-19  MYEFO, expected tax receipts, including new policy, have been 
                          revised up by $1.2 billion in 2018-19, but have been revised down by 25$ 0 million in 
                          2019-20 and by $18.2 billion over the four years to 2022-23. 
                          Excluding GST, tax receipts including new policy have been revised up by $2.2 billion 
                          in 2018-19 and $1.6 billion in 2019-20, but have been revised down by $8.0 billion over 
                          the four years to 2022-23. As GST receipts flow through to the States, tax receipts 
                          excluding GST represent the tax receipts available to the Austr aGliovanernment to 
                          meet its own spending needs. 
                          Including new policy, total tax receipts are forecast to grow by 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 
                          and 3.9pe  r cent in 201290,-  and by 4.2 per cent on average over the four years to 
                          2022-23 (Table 1). The growth in tax receipts is in line with growth prospects for the 
                          Australian economy, with the continued absorption ofa sre cp apacity in the labour 
                          market supporting a pick-up in average wage growth. 
                          Total tax receipts as a share of GDP are expected to increase from3  2p3.er cent in 
                          2019-20  to  23.7 per cent  in  2021-22,  before  temporarily dipping in 2022-23 to 
                          23.3 per cent.  Tax receipts as a share of GDP are texhepn ected to rise over the 
                          medium-term period, but remain below the 23.9 per cent tax cap until 2029-30.

                               and the 2018-19 MYEFO estimates. Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, tax receipt shave been 
                               revised up by $1.2 billion in 2018-19. This revision was driven by parameter and other 
                               variations, which include revisions due to recent economic conditions, the updated 
                               economic outlook, ye-ator-date tax collections and other non-policy factors. Tax 
                               receipts have been revised down by $250 million in 2019-20 as the reduction in receipts 
                               due to policy decisions more than offsest the increase in receipts from parameter and 
                               other variations.

           revised up by $900 million in 201-819, reflecting stronger-than-expected collections 
           relating to prior income years and lthowaner-e-xpected deduc,t sionsuch as 
           work-related expenses.  From 2019-20,  the  revisions to the outlook for growth  in
           average wages and non-farm gross mixed income contribute to a downward revision 
           to individuals and other withholding taxation receipts of 80$0 million in 2019-20 and 
           $8.1 billion over the four years to 2022-23.  
           The Government’s measure Lower taxes for hard-working Australians: Building on the 
           Personal Income Tax Plna, which will provide an additional $19.5 billion in persnoal 
           income tax relief over the four years to 202-223, will reduce individuals and other 
           withholding taxation receipts by a total of $5.7 billion over the four years to 202223- , 
           due to the inclusion of a provision in the 201-819 MYEFO. The measure will provide 
           additional tax relief to individuals, supporting consumption growth and easing cost of 
           living pressures. Further information on themea  sure  Lower taxes for har-dworking 
           Australians: Building on the Personal Income Tax Pl can ban e found in Budget Paper 
           No. 2, Budget Measures 2019-20. 
           Fringe benefits tax 
           Receipts from fringe benefits tax are forecast to fallby   3.9 per cent in 2018-19 but to 
           grow by 4.5 per cent in 2019-20. Relative to the 2018-19 MYEFO, receipts are expected 
           to be $60 million lower in 2018-19, $70 million lower in 2019-20 and $300 million lower 
           over the four years to 2022-23, reflecting a declining share of total compensation of 
           employees expected to be provided as fringe benefits. 
           Company tax 
           Compared with the 2801-19 MYEFO,  company tax receipts are expected to be 
           $1.2 billion higher in 2018-19, $3.4 billion higher in 2019-20 and $8.0 billion higher over 
           the four years to 2022-23. The large upward revision in 2019-20 reflects expected gains 
           in 2018-19 mining profits flowing into 2019-20 as a result of the delays between when 
           profit is accrued and when company tax is paid. In addition, while commodity prices 
           are assumed to decline over 2019-20, the continued period of elevated prices relative to 
           the 2018-19 MYEFO further improves mining profits and company tax in that year. 
                             4-11 
                      Statement 4: Revenue 
                      The Government’s decision to extend and expand the Australian Taxation Office’s Tax 
                      Avoidance Taskforce  will also increase tax receip, pts articularly in20  21-22 and 
                      2022-23.  
                      The strength in company tax receipts, which are forecast to grow by 10.8 per cent in 
                      2018-19 and 5.5 per cent in 2019-20, largely reflects strength in expected mining profits. 
                      However,  these  profits  are  not  anticipated  to fully flow through to company tax 
                      receipts over the forward estimates. This is in part because several LNG companies 
                      have accumulated a large stock o flosses from previous investments, which can be 
                      used to reduce tax payable in the coming years (see Box 2, Budget Statement 5, Budget 
                      Paper No. 1 of the 2017-18 Budget for a discussion of losses and company tax timing).  
                      The outlook for commodity prices is a source of significant uncertainty for the 
                      forecasts of company tax receFiputrts.he r information on the2 019-20 Budget 
                      assumptions for commodity prices is available in Budget Statement 2(p ages 2-20 and 
                      2-21), and details on the impact of changes in tashesu mptions on tax receipts are 
                      discussed in Box 4, Budget Statement 2. 
                      Superannuation fund taxes 
                      Tax receipts from superannuation funds are expected to grow b pyer c 5.1 ent in 
                      2018-19 but fall by 14.5 per cent in 2019-20. The forecast fall in 2019-20 mainly reflects 
                      the impact of recent off-market share buybacks.  
                      Compared with the 2018-19 MYEFO, receipts are expected to be around $650 million 
                      higher in 2018-19, $800 million  higher in 2019-20  and  $2.1  billion higher over the 
                      four years  to 202-223. Higher receipts my ainlreflect  stronger outcomes from 
                      superannuation funds relating to the 2017-18 income year. Gains in equity markets 
                      since the 2018-19 MYEFO have also contributed to the upward revisions to expected 
                      tax receipts.  
                      Petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT)    
                           1
                      PRRT  receipts are forecast to grow by 3 .pe1 r cent in 2018-19 and 21.7 per cent in 
                      2019-20. Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, receipts are expected to be $200 million lower in 
                      2018-19, $100 million lower in 2019-20 and $450 million lower over the four years to 
                      2022-23,  consistent with weak-ethran-expected  collections.  These revisions are 
                      unrelated to the measures announced in the Governm’ens rt esponse to the 2017 
                      Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Review.  
                                                                                 
                      1   PRRT estimates include an amount of Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) receipts which 
                         has not been separately disclosed owing to taxpayer confidentiality. 
                                                           4-12 
                                         Statement 4: Revenue 
           Goods and services tax (GST) 
           Receipts from GST are forecast to grow  by  4.0  per cent  in 201-819  (equivalent to 
           $2.5 billion), and by 2.4 per cent (equivalent to $1.6 billion) in 2019-20. Compared with 
           the 2018-19 MYEFO, receipts are expected to be around 1$.0 billion lower in 2018-19, 
           $1.8 billion lower in 2019-20 and $10.3 billion lower over the four years to 2022-23. The 
           downward revisions reflect weathkaner--expected  collections, and the downward 
           revisions to forecasts for growth in consumption and dwelling investment.  
           Nonetheless, GST receipts are expected to grow by 4.2 per cent on average over the four 
           years to 2022-23 and are projected to be $14.3 billion higher in 2022-23 than in 2017-18. 
           Excise and customs duty 
           Excise and customs duty receipts are forecast to grow by  3p.7er cent in 2018-19 and 
           14.9 per cent in 2019-20. The strong growth in 2019-20 partly reflects the commencement 
           of the 2018-19 Budget measure Black Economy Package — combatting illicit tobacco. 
           Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, excise and customs duty receipts have been revised down by 
           $340 million in 2018-19, $420 million in 2019-20 and $2.6 billion over the four years to 
           2022-23. The downward revision in 201-819 reflects weaker-than-expected collections. 
           The downward revisions beyond 2-01918 reflect lower forecasts for household 
           consumption growth and crude oil excise. 
           Other sales taxes 
           Other sales taxes include the luxury car tax (LCT) and the wine equalisation tax (WET).  
           LCT receipts are forecast to decline by 7.9 per cent i-n1 29, a01n8d remain flat in 
           2019-20. This is consistent with a decline in the sales of vehicles subject to LCT as well as 
           a decline in the average prices of these vehicles. Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, LCT receipts 
           have been revised down by $360 million over the four years to 2022-23.  
           WET receipts are forecast to grow by 13.0 per cent in 2081-19 and 6.9 per cent in 
           2019-20. Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, forecast WET receipts have been revised down by 
           $100 million over the four years to 2022-23. 
           Other taxes 
           Compared with the 2018-19 MYEFO, major bank levy receipts are expected to be 
           unchanged in 2018-19, but around $200 million lower over the four years to 20-223,2 
           consistent with lower-than-expected growth in eligible bank liabilities. Nonetheless, 
           major bank levy receipts are forecast to increase from $1.6 billion i-n1 29 to018 
           $1.9 billion in 2022-23.  
           Other  taxes are forecast to grow by 21.4 per cent in 2018-19  and  by  2.5 per cent in 
           2019-20.  Since the 2081-19 MYEFO, other taxes are around  $110 million  higher  in 
           2018-19, $180 million lower in 2019-20 and $420 million lower over the four years to 
           2022-23.  
                             4-13 
           Statement 4: Revenue 
           Another component of other taxes is the Skilling Australians Fund levy. Since the 
           2018-19 MYEFO, Skilling Australians Fund levy receipts are forecast to be $126 million 
           lower over the four years to 202-223. This reflects lower-than-expected demand for 
           employer nominated visas.  
           Non-taxation receipts 
           Since the 2018-19 MYEFO, non-taxation receipts have been revised up by $1.9 billion in 
           2018-19, largely reflecting upward revisions in Future Fund earnings. N-taoxnation 
           receipts have been revised down by $247.9 million in 2019-20, largely reflecting lower 
           than expected State and Territory contributions to the National Disability Insurance 
           Scheme (NDIS) and lower than expected recei pfrotsm the Pharmaceutical Benefist 
           Scheme. 
           Non-taxation receipts (including Future Fund earninsg) are expected to grow by 
           26.0 per cent in 201-189, primarily due to increased Future Fund earnings and the 
           growth in State and Territory contributions to the INSD, reflecting the progressive 
           implementation of the NDIS. Ntaonxa-tion receipts are expected to grow by 
           7.6 per cent in 2019-20, largely reflecting higher Unclaimed Super Monies receipts due 
           to the commencement of the Protecting Your Super Package. 
           The changes in the individual heads of revenue relative to t201he 8-19 MYEFO are 
           shown in Table 5 and Table 6, for 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively. Table 7 shows the

                            VARIATIONS IN REVENUE ESTIMATES 
                            The revenue estimates are the accrual accounting equivalent of the cash-based receipts 
                            estimates. Changes in revenue are generally driven by the same factors as receipts. 
                            Revenue amounts are usually higher than the cash equivalents because the amounts 
                            are generally recognised when they are owed rather than when they are paid. The 
                            differences between the accrual and cash amounts therefore generally reflect timing 
                            differences. Table 8 provides a reconciliation of the 2019-20 Budget’s revenue estimates 
                            with those at the 2018-19 MYEFO.

                               APPENDIX A: TAX BENCHMARKS AND VARIATIONS 
                                                         STATEMENT 
                       This appendix contains an overview of Australian Government tax benchmarks and 
                       variations, as required by Section 12 of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (CBHA). 
                       Tax benchmarks represent a standard taxation treatment that appliesim tiloa sr 
                       taxpayers or types of activities. Policy approaches can apply a taxation treatment 
                       different from a standard approach and the resulting variations can give rise to 
                       positive or negative variations. 
                       The choice of benchmark unavoidably involves judgment and may therefore be 
                       contentious in some cases. 
                       Benchmark variation estimates should be interpreted with caution as they do not 
                       indicate the revenue gain or loss to the budget if they were to be abolished by a change 
                       of policy. In addition, the characterisation of a provision of the tax law that gives rise 
                       to a benchmark variation does not indicate a view on how an activity or class of 
                       taxpayer ought to be taxed. 
                       Consistent with most OECD countries, estimates of a benchmark variation reflect the 
                       extent to  which a variation is utilised, similar tod buget estimates of outlays on 
                       demand-driven expenditure programs. 
                       This is known as therev ‘enue forgone ’approach which, in practice, involves 
                       estimating the difference in revenue between the actual and benchmark tax treatments 
                       but, importantly, assuming taxpayer behaviour is the same in each circumstance. 
                       Revenue forgone estimates therefore do not indicate the revenue gain to the Australian 
                       Government Budget if specific benchmark variations were abolished throug pholicy 
                       change, as there may be significant changes in taxpayer behaviour were the variations 
                       removed. 
                       Care needs to be taken when comparing benchmark variations with direct 
                       expenditures as they may measure different things. In addition, estimates from 
                       different editions of previously released Tax Expenditures Statements (TES) are 
                       generally not comparable, because of changes or modifications to fo—r ex    ample — 
                       benchmarks, individual benchmark variations, data used or modelling methodology. 
                       The CBHA also requires the publication of an annual report. The 2018 Tax Benchmarks 
                       and Variations Statement was published in January 2019 and provides a detailed 
                       description of Australian Government benchmarks and benchmark variations and, 
                       where possible, the estimated vluea, or order of magnitude, of each benchmark 
                       variation. 
                                                               4-21 
           Statement 4: Revenue 
           The information in Table A1 is derived from the 2018T ax Benchmarks and Variations 
           Statement and does not include the impact of decisions in this Budget on benchmark 
           variations. Further information on benchmarks and variations from them will be 
           available in future Tax Benchmark and Variations reports.

                                                                                  INVESTMENT 
                                    Statement  5  presents estimates of general government sector expenses and net 
                                    capital investment, allocated according to the various functions of government, on a 
                                    fiscal balance basis. These functions are based on an international standard 
                                    classification of functions of government that is incorporated into the Government 
                                    Finance Statistics (GFS) reporting framework. 
                                    The first part of this statement provides information on trends in estimated 
                                    expenses and the second part presents trends in net capital inevstment estimates. 
                                    Estimates are on an Australian Government general government sector basis. 
                                    Statement 5 focuses on short to medium term trends in estimated expenses and 
                                    their underlying drivers. Consistent with this emphasis, much of Statem ent 5
                                    explains year on year changes across the forward estimates period. 
                                    The main trends are: 
                                    •   in 2019-20  the social security and welfare, health, defence and education 
                                        functions account for nearly two thirds of total expenses, with social security and 
                                        welfare accounting for slightly more than one third of total expenses; 
                                    •   in real terms, the strongest growth across the budget and forward estimates is 
                                        expected to occur in the education and the social security and welfare functions; 
                                        and 
                                    •   net capital investment in 2019-20  largely reflects continued investment in 
                                        defence capital projects.

                          OVERVIEW 
                          Australian Government general government sector (GGS) accrual expenses are 
                          expected to increase by 0.7 per cent in real terms in 2901-20, with the growth rate 
                          remaining stable  in 2020-2021. This reflects slower growth across a range of 
                          Government programs, partially offset by growth in education and social security and 
                          welfare programs. Reflecting the Government’s continued focus on fal riessctraint, 
                          total expenses are expected to decline as a percentage of GDP from0 2 pe5r. cent in 
                          2019-20  to 24.6 per cent in 2022-23. The decline in total expense over the forward 
                          estimates compares with significant growth in total expenses during tiheod  per
                          2007-08 to 201314- when expenses rose from 28 pe3.r cent of GDP in 200-708 to 
                          25.9 per cent of GDP in 2013-14.

                          As set out in Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlooko f Budget Paper No. 1, the 
                          Government also reports spending on an underlying cash basis. In cash terms, 
                          Government spending is forecast to grow by an average of 1.3 per cent per annum in 
                          real terms over the four years to 2022-23 and total payments are expected to decline as 
                          a percentage of GDP from 24.6 per cent in 2019-20 to 24.5 per cent in 2022-23.

                          •   general public services — the decrease in expenses between 201-819 and 2019-20 
                              largely reflects the use of different discount rates applied to superannuation 
                              expenses; 
                          •   defence — the increase in expenses from 2019-20 to 20222-3 reflects the funding 
                              required to deliver the plans set out in the 2016 Defence White Paper; 
                          •   education — the increase in expenses from 201-920 to 2022-23 largely reflects the 
                              school funding arrangements implemented under the Quality School spackage and 
                              increased funding for non-government schools under the 2018-19 MYEFO measure 
                             Response to the Review of the Socio-Economic Status Score Methodology; 
                          •   health — the increase in expenses from 20-1209  to 20222-3 is largely driven by 
                              growth in the assistance to the States for public hospita lsand medical services 
                              and benefits sub-functions. The increase in payments for public hospitals reflects 
                             higher growth in activity, and the growth in expenditure  mforedical services 
                             reflects the growth in use of high value items as well as the introduction of 
                             measures to strengthen primary care, including a new chronic disease care funding 
                             model and increased funding for diagnostic imaging services;  
                                                                       5-7

                                       largely reflects the impact of an ageing population accessing the Aged Pension and 
                                       residential and home care, the transition to the full National Disability Insurance 
                                       Scheme to support people with a significant and permanent disability, and growth 
                                       in child care support for families; 
                                  •    housing and community amenities — the decrease in expenses from 280-119 to 
                                       2019-20 and the decrease from 20-1290 to 2022-23 largely reflects the scheduled 
                                       completion of payments to the tastes and territories under National Partnership 
                                       Agreements and the completion of urban and regional development projects;  
                                  •    transport and communication — the increased profile of expenses from 2019-20 to 
                                       2022-23  largely reflects new adn existing commitments to major infrastructure 
                                       projects within the road and rail transport sub-functions; and 
                                  •    other purposes — the increase in expenses from 2018-19 to 2022-23 largely reflects 
                                       growing general revenue assistance payments (largely GST) to be made to the states 
                                       and territories and the conservative bias allowance component of the Contingency 
                                       Reserve. 
                                  Government expenses are strongly influenced by underlying trends in spending in the 
                                  social security and welfare, health and education functions (see Box 1). Together, these 
                                  functions account for 59.6  per cent of all government expenses in 290-120. Further 
                                  details of spending trends against all functions, including movements in expenses 
                                  from 2018-19 to 2019-20, are set out under individual function headings.

                                Box 1: Where does government spending go in 2019-20? 
                                Government spending provides a wide range of services to the community. The 
                                most significant component of government spending relates to social security and 
                                welfare, with around one third of ttaol expenses providing support to the aged, 
                                families with children, people with disabilities, veterans, carers and unemployed 
                                people. 
                                Another one sixth of government expenses occur in health, including Medicare 
                                Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Bneefits Scheme (PBS) payments. 
                                A similar amount is also transferred to the states and territories in general revenue 
                                assistance under the other purposes function. 
                                The Government also provides significant investment under the education function, 
                                supporting government and nong-overnment schools, as well as higher education 
                                and vocational education and training. The remainder is spent on defence and a 
                                range of other public services.

                              proportion of the top 20 expense programs provide financial assistance or services to 
                              the aged, families, people with a disability, students, carers and the unemployed.

                          The increase in expenses from 201-819 to 2019-20 and the decrease over the period 
                          2019-20 to 20222-3 reflects the payment cycles of Australia’s contributions under the 
                          multi-year funding arrangements for multilateral funds such as the Asian

                          Total expenses under this sub-function are expected to increase by 2.7 per cent in real

                          The increase in expenses for this sub-function primarily relates to the 2019-20 Budget

                          The fall in expenses from 2018-19 to 20-1920 in the government superannuation 
                          benefits sub-function reflects the use of different discount rates. In accordance with 
                          accounting standards, the superannuation expenses for 2018-19 were calculated using 
                          the long-term government bond rate as at 1 July 2018 that best matched each 
                          individual scheme’s liability duration. These ra  twesere broadly between 2.7 and 
                          3.1 per cent per annum. Forward years are estimated based on the discount rate 
                          recommended by the superannuation scheme actuaries in preparing the latest 
                          Long Term Cost Reports (5 per cent).

                          terms between 2019-20 and 2022-23. The forecast decline in expenses over the forward 
                          estimates relates to downward revisions to expected claims by universities for 
                          superannuation payments and the 201-819 MYEFO measure Research Block Grants — 
                          growth adjustment.

                          11.1 per cent in real terms from 201920-  to 2022-23. The change in expenses over the 
                          forward estimates primarily reflects the revised funding profile of the National 
                          Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development. The expected decrease in expenses 
                          in 2022-23 primarily reflects the conclusion of the Skilling Australians Fund National 
                          Partnership Agreement on 3 0June 2022.  The Government is providing additional 
                          funding to vocational education and training in the 2019-20 Budget measure Skills 
                          Package — Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow which is reflected in the vocational

                       2022-23. The increase in expenses over the forward years is primarily due to the school 
                       funding arrangements implemented under the Quality School spackage and increased 
                       funding for nong-overnment schools under the 2018-19 MYEFO measureR  esponse to 
                       the Review of the Socio-Economic Status Score Methodology.

                       81.1 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The increase in expenses in 2019-20 
                       is primarily due to the 202190 B- udget measure Local School Community Fu. ndThe 
                       decrease in expenses over the forward years primarily reflects the conclusion of the

                               expenses for 2019-20. Growth in Medicare expenses is the major driver of growth in

                          2019-20 to 2022-23, as a result of ongoing growth in the use of medical services and the

                          is around 53.9 per cent, providing a high level of access to private health services and 
                          taking pressure off the public system.

                          by 18.6 per cent in real terms over the period 201-920 to 2023-23. This largely reflects 
                          the improved payments administration announced in the 2-190 B18 udget which 
                          reduces PBS revenues and expenses by a corresponding amount fcoros t high-

                          deliver hospital services in the home and emergency department services. Expenditure 
                          for this sub-function is expected to increase by 1.7 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 
                          to 2019-20, largely reflecting higher anticipated growth in the volume of services. 
                          Expenditure also reflects the impact of the National Efficient Price 201 det9 ermination. 
                          Expenditure is expected to increase by 8 pe.3r cent in real terms over the period 
                          2019-20 to 20222-3, reflecting the Government’s agreement withta stes and territories

                       The  hospital services sub-function consists mainly of payments to ttheate ss and 
                       territories to deliver veterans’ hospital services. Expenditure for this s-funubction is 
                       expected to decrease by 8.2 per cent in real terms between 2018-19 and 2019-20, and by 
                       17.5 per cent in real terms over the period 2019-20 to 2022-23. The decrease in expenses 
                       reflects an expected reduction in the number of veterans requiring treatment and 
                       efficiencies achieved in the pricing arrangements. 
                       Expenses in the health services sub-function include Australian Government expenses 
                       associated with the delivery of population health, medical research, mental health, 
                       blood and blood products, other allied health services, health infrastructure and 
                       disbursement from the Medical Research Future Fund.  
                       Health services  expenditure is expected to decrease by  p3er.8 cent in real terms 
                       between 2018-19 and 2019-20, largely reflecting the schedule of payments made under 
                       the National Partnership Agreements for the National Health Innovation Fund and for 
                       the  Community Health and Hospitals Program, and the schedule of payments for the 
                       Proton Beam Facilit, ay  s well as reduced expenditure on health infrastructure. 
                       Expenses for this sub-function are expected to increase by .14 per cent in real terms 
                       between 2019-20 and 2022-23, largely reflecting projected expenditure on blood and 
                       blood products under the National Supply Plan and Budget agreed with the states and 
                       territories.

                       administrative costs, investment in health workforce measures and support for rural 
                       health initiatives. Expenditure for this- sfunubction is expected to decrease by 
                       6.6 per cent in real terms between 2081-19 and 2019-20 largely as a result of revised 
                       payment arrangements to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and de crease by
                       7.0 per cent over the period 201-209  to 20222-3 as a result of the conclusion of the

                          The most significant driv ersof this growth are the assistance to the aged and

                          sub-function is expected to grow by 1. 9per cent in real terms between 2018-19 and 
                          2019-20, and by 6.6 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The assistance to 
                          people with disabilities sub-function is expected to grow by 4.5 per cent in real terms 
                          from 20181-9 to 2019-20, and by 10.0 per cent in real terms from 201-920 to 2022-23

                          (NDIS). This sub-function includes Commonwealth as well as State and Territory 
                          contributions to the NDIS.  
                          The principal driver of growth over the forward estimates for the assistance to the 
                          aged  sub-function  is Income Support for Seniors, which is estimated to grow by 
                          1.2 per cent in real terms from 201189 to-      2019-20, and by 5.7 per cent in real terms 
                          from 201920 to-      202223-. Growth in these years is moderated by a reduction in 
                          expenses associated with incremental increases in the Age Pension age. Contributing to 
                          growth from 2019-20 to 2022-23 is an increase of 11.2 per cent in real terms in expenses 
                          associated with the Aged Care Services program, largely reflecting demographic 
                          factors and the impact of the 2018-19 Budget measure More Choices for a Longer Life—

                          arrangements with the states and territories. Growth in NDIS expenses will stabilise in 
                          the latter part of the forward estimates, with the NDIS scheduled to achieve national 
                          coverage. Of the total $88.1 billion in NDIS expenses from 2019-20 to 2022-23, the 
                          Commonwealth is contributing funding of $54.7 billion, with the states and territories 
                          contributing the remaining funding.  
                          Subject to negotiations, the Commonwealth will provide payments to thtaete ss and 
                          territories  of $5.4 billion from the DisabilityCare Australia Fund  over the forward 
                          estimates. The timing of these payments w riellsult in DisabilityCare Australia Fun d

                          The reduction in the Assistance to the States for Disability Services component reflects 
                          the progressive withdrawal of the National Disability Specific Purpose Payment 
                          (ND SPP) once existing clients in each State or Territory have transitioned to the NDIS. 
                          As ND SPP payments terminate for each State or Territory, equivalent funding will be 
                                                                       5-23

                          redirected to the NDIS. Prior to the ND SPP ceasing, tshetate s and territories will 
                          repay part of their ND SPP payments to the Commonwealth to meet NDIS costs. These 
                          arrangements will temporarily increase total Commonwealth payments, as part of the 
                          ND SPP funding will be expensed twice – when the payment is made to the states and 
                          territories, and when the returned funds are expensed on the NDIS.  
                          Expenses for the Income Support for People with Disability program, which primarily 
                          consists of Disability Support Pension (DSP), are estimated to increase b y0.1 per cent 
                          in real terms from 201819-  to 2019-20, and decrease by 2.3 per cent in real terms from 
                          2019-20 to 2022-23. This is driven by the ongoing impact of a range of measures, which 
                          have better targeted DSP eligibility and assessment processes to ensure those in need 
                          receive the support they need.  
                          Expenses for the Income for Carers component are estimated to increase by 2.9 per cent 
                          in real terms from 201819- to 2019-20, and 6.8 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 
                          2022-23. Recipient numbers for the largest component of this, Carer Payment, continue 
                          to increase but are expected to moderate once the 201-189 Budget measure, Integrated 
                          Carer Support Services, is fully implemented.

                          Expenses for the assistance to families with childr esun b-function are expected to 
                          increase by 25.  per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and decrease by 
                          1.7 per cent in real terms from 201920-  to 2022-23, with the decrease driven primarily 
                          by reduced expenditure on the Family Tax Benefit (FTB). FTB expenses are expected to 
                          increase by 0.1 per cent in real terms from 2-1901 8to 2019-20, and decrease by 
                          5.1 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The decrease in expenses to 2022-23 
                          is driven by the cumulative impact of policy amendments to target payment eligibility
                                                                                                                       .

                        The assistance to families with children sub-function profile includes an increase in 
                        Child Care Fee Assistance expenses of 4.8 per cent in real terms fro-19 tm 20o1 8
                        2019-20, and by 8.7 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The increase reflects 
                        continued growth in the usage of child care by families and also reflects expected 
                        increases in fees charged by child care providers. 
                        Families and Children expenses are expected to increase by 165.3 per cent in real terms 
                        from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and decreae bs   y 35.3 per cent in real terms from 20-1209 to 
                        2022-23. Both the initial increase and the subsequent decrease in expensesref  lect the 
                        expected profiles for payments from the National Redress Scheme that commenced on 
                        1 July 2018. Excluding the impact of the Scheme, Families and Children expenses are 
                        broadly stable over the forward estimates. 
                        Expenses for Paid Parental Leave (PPL) are estimated to increase by 1.3 per cent in real 
                        terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and increase by 2.2 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 
                        to 2022-23. These changes from 2018-19 to 2022-23 are largely due to the projected 
                        increase in the number of PPL recipients and the 20-1189 MYEFO measure Women’s 
                        Economic Security Package, which provided primary carers of children with better access 
                        to PPL and more flexibility in how it is used.

                          increase by 9.6 per cent in real terms from 2-01819 to 202019,-  and decrease by 
                          24.8 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The decrease is primarily driven by 
                          reduced expenses for theurba       n and regional developmensut b-function reflecting 
                          completion of projects under key programs. 
                          The housing sub-function includes the Australian Government’s contribution to the 
                          National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, the provision of housing for the 
                          general public and people with special needs and DHA expenses. The expenses for this 
                          sub-function are estimated to increase by 0. 9per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 
                          2019-20, and decrease by 8.2 per cent in real terms from 201-920 to 2022-23, reflecting 
                          decreasing payments under the National Rental Affordability Scheme which is now closed 
                          to new applicants and a forecast reduction in the construction and acquisition of DHA 
                          properties in 2020-21. The Government also provides housing support through the 
                          National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, which is not reflected in this 
                          sub-function.     
                          The urban and regional developmentsu  b-function comprises of City and Regional 
                          Deals, services to territories and regional development programs, including 
                          Community Development Grants and the Building Better Regions Fun. dExpenses are 
                          estimated to increase by 34.9 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20 reflecting a 
                          number of 2019-20 Budget measures including Community Development Grants 
                          Programme — additional projects, Building Better Regions Fun—d  round four, Stronger 
                          Communities Programme — round five, and Implementing Sport 2030, and projects under 
                          various City Deals. Expenses are expected to reduce by 70.0 per cent in real terms from 
                          2019-20 to 20222-3, largely reflecting the expected completion of projects under key 
                          programs, such as the Building Better Regions Fund, the National Stronger Regions Fund, 
                          the Regional Jobs and Investment packages, the Regional Growth Fund, and various City 
                          Deals.

           Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment 
           The environment protection sub-function includes expenses for a variety of initiatives, 
           including the protection and conservation of the environment, water and waste 
           management, pollution abatement and environmental research. Expenses are 
           estimated to increase by 3.5 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and increase 
           by  3.5  per cent from 201-920 to 2022-23. The increase from 20-1189 to 2019-20  is 
           primarily due to additional funding provided through the 20-2109 Budget measure 
           Practical Environment Restoration and re-profiling of funding within the Reef Trust.

                          and recreation activities, as well as the management and protection of national parks 
                          and other world heritage areas. This function also includes expenses relating to the 
                          protection and preservation of historic sites and buildings, including war graves.

                          Total expenses under the recreation and culture function are estimated to decrease by 
                          5.4 per cent in real terms from 201819 to-      2019-20, and by 10.5 per cent in real terms 
                          over the period 2019-2020 to 2022-23. 
                          Expenses under the broadcasting sub-function are expected to decrease by 2.9 per cent 
                          in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and by 5.3 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 
                          2022-23. This reflects the Government’s decision to maintain the Australian 
                          Broadcasting Corporation’s (ABC) operational funding at 2018-19 levels from 2019-20 
                          to 2021-22, which has no impact on funding for transmission and distribution, and the 
                          impact of previous efficiency measures applied to the ABC and the Special 
                          Broadcasting Corporation (SBS). This indexation pause is partially offset by additional 
                          funding announced in the 2019-20 Budget measure Guaranteeing Austraal’is  Public 
                          Broadcasters — funding for the ABC and SBS and the 2018-19 Budget measure Funding for

           Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment 
           Expenses under the arts and cultural heritage sub-function are estimated to decrease 
           by 3.3 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and by 10.5 per cent in real terms 
           from 2019-20 to 2022-23. This sub-function includes funding for the arts and cultural 
           institutions. The estimated decreases reflect fewer produc taiopnpslying for and 
           receiving taxation rebates through the Australian Screen Production Incentive and the 
           effect of implementation of efficiencies in previous economic updates. These decreases 
           are partially offset by the 2018-19 Budget measure Location Incentive Funding Program 
           which provides funding to encourage large-budget international productions to film in 
           Australia, and the 2019-20 Budget measures Bundanon Trust Art Centre; National Library 
           of Australia — Digitisation Fund;a nd  National Collecting Institutions  —  capital works 
           funding, which provide funding to support agencies in transitioning to more modern, 
           sustainable and productive operating models.  
           Expenses under the sport and recreation sub-function are estimated to decreas eby 
           18.1 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and decrease by 37.2 per cent in real 
           terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The decrease in 2019-20 primarily reflects a reduction in 
           sport related infrastructure expenditure. The reduction in expenditure from 2019-20 to 
           2022-23  largely reflects the expected completion of grant funding for-te srm hort
           community-led projects to increase participation in sport and physical activity, and the 
           completion of elements of the national sport plan, Sport 2030. This decrease in expenses 
           is partially offset by additional funding provided through the 2019-20 Budget measure 
           Implementing Sport 2030, noting that the majority of that fundingw  ill occur in 2019-20 
           and 2020-21.  
           Expenses under the national estate and parks sub-function are estimated to decrease 
           by 4.3 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and increase by 1.3 per cent in 
           real terms from 2019-20 to 20222-3. The decrease from 20-1198  to 2019-20 reflects a 
           range of small short-term programs finalising in 2018-19. The increase from 2019-20 to 
           2022-23 reflects increased funding for the Australian Antarctic Progr,a inm cluding 
           $473.3  million over 11  years from 2081-19  provided through the 201-209  Budget

                          It also includes expenses related to improving Australia’s energy efficiency, resource

                          Expenses under the Resources and Energy component are estimated to decrease by 
                          12.5 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20, and decrease by 48.4 per cent in real 
                          terms from 2019-20 to 202223-. This reflects a number of terminating measures, 
                          including the cessation of funding for the development of a detailed business case for 
                          the National Radioactive Waste Management Facility and Carbon Capture and Storage 
                          Flagships programs in 2018-19, the cessation of the Coal Mining Abatement

                          Development of New Onshore Gas Supply program in 2-02210. The decrease in 
                          expenses is partly offset by th e2018-19 MYEFO measure Action Plan to Reduce Power 
                          Prices and the 2019-20 Budget measure Supporting Reliable Energy Infrastructure and also

           The overall decrease in expenses under the renewable energy component from 2019-20 
           to 2022-23 reflects the decrease in grants expenses for the Australian Renewable

                          2019-20 to 202223-   mainly  relates to the profile of expenses for concessional loans

                          reflects the reduced demand for Government assistance in the manufacturing secto r,

           The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) was established on 1 July 2016. 
           The NAIF offers concessional finance of up to $5 billion to encourage and complement 
           private sector investment in infrastructure that benefits northern Australia. The change 
           in expenses reflects the accounting treatment of concessional loans expected to be 
           provided as part of the NAIF’s operations.  
           Expenses under the Other component are expected to decrease by 0.2 per cent in real 
           terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20. The decrease by 20.8 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 
           to 2022-23 is partially driven by the completion of the Junior Minerals Exploration 
           Incentive program, which was extended in the 2017-18 MYEFO.

                          Total expenses under this function are estimated toc rinease by 9.3 per cent in real 
                          terms between 2018-19 and 2019-20, and by 15.0 per cent in real terms over the period 
                          2019-20 to 2022-23. 
                          The estimated expenses for the communication sub-function relate to communication 
                          activities and support for the digital economy through the Department of 
                          Communications and the Arts and the Australian Communications and Media 
                          Authority. Total expenses under this s-fuunctb ion are estimated to increase by 
                          49.0 per cent in real terms between 2018-19 and 2019-20, and decrease by 14.8 per cent 
                          in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The increase primarily reflects commencement in 
                          2019-20 of the Regional Broadband Scheme, which provides funding for regional fixed 
                          wireless and satellite connections through the National Broadband Network. The 
                          expected decrease in expenses from 2-200 to19              202232-  reflects the anticipated 
                          completion of projects, phased funding for the Digital Transformation Agency and the 
                          conclusion of the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund in 2020-21. 
                          The expenses under the rail trans psuortb-function primarily consist of grants 
                          provided under the Infrastructure Investment Program. Expenses are estimated to 
                          decrease by 13.5 per cent in real terms between 201-819 and 2019-20, but increase by 
                          69.3 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The initial decrease in expenditure 
                          largely reflects the expected completion of rail p  irno 20jects18-19  including the 
                          Ballarat Rail Line Upgrade and rail projects under the Infrastructure Growth Package – 
                          Asset Recycling Fund. The subsequent significant increase in expenditure from 2019-20 
                          to 2022-23 reflects the Government’s commitments to major rail projects, including the 
                          Melbourne Airport Rail Link and funding provided for the Western Sydney North 
                          South Rail Link in the 201-290 Budget measure Infrstaructure Investment Program — 
                          New South Wales infrastructure investments. In addition to expenditure on rail transport, 
                          the Government is providing an equity investment of $9.0 billion for the delivery of 
                          Inland Rail, which is not reflected in this sub-function. 
                                                                       5-37 
                          Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment 
                          The estimated expenses for the air transport and sea transport sub-functions primarily 
                          relate to activities of the safety regulators —th  e Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the 
                          Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the Australian Transp oSratfety 
                          Bureau (ATSB). Total expenses under the air transport sub-functions are estimated to 
                          decrease by 3.6 per cent in real terms between 201-189 and 2019-20, primarily due to 
                          expenditure associated with a on-ofef grant to Avalon Airport in 2-1901.8 Total 
                          expenses under the sub-function are expected to decrease by 26.2 per cent in real terms 
                          from 20120 to9-      202223- as the Western Sydney Airport preparatory works are 
                          completed. In addition ,the Government is providing an equity investment of up to 
                          $5.3 billion in WSA Co to complete the construction of the, w ahiirpchor it s not 
                          reflected in this sub-function. Total expenses under the sea transport sub-function are 
                          estimated to decrease by 0. 5per cent in real terms between 201-819 and 2019-20, and 
                          decrease by 0.4 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23 due to slower growth in 
                          the forecast demand for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. 
                          The expenses under the road transposurtb -function primarily consist of grants 
                          provided under the Infrastructure  Investment Program. Expenses are estimated to 
                          increase by 9.1 per cent in real terms between 20-119 an8        d 2019-20, and increase by 
                          17.3 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The increase in expenditure largely 
                          reflects continued investment in road transport infrastructure under the $4 .b0illion 
                          Urban Congestion Fund, the $4.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importan cine itiative, funding 
                          for the Bruce Highway aPnadci  fic Motorway and  the $1.b1ill  ion investment in

                          estimated to decrease by 6.0 per cent in real terms between 201-819 and 2019-20 and 
                          increase by 0.5 per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 2022-23. The decrease in expenses 
                          primarily reflects the decrease in program support for the Infrastructure, Regional 
                          Development and Cities portfolio associtaed with the expected completion of the 
                          Government’s preparatory works for the Western Sydney Airport.

                     decrease by 6.0 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 2019-20. Expenses are expected to 
                     decrease by 108. per cent in real terms from 2019-20 to 20222-3, largely driven b ya 
                     number of measures that terminate during the forward estimates. These include new 
                     2019-20 Budget measures such as Expanding Questacon’s Education Outreach and 
                     Implementing Sport 2030, where funding will occur between 2019-20 and 2021-22.  
                     Expenses for the Bureau of Meteorology (the Bureau) are projected to decrease by 
                     17.4 per cent in real terms from 201-920 to 2022-23. The decrease in expenses reflects 
                     the expected completion of information and communications technology (ICT) 
                     projects, including the fsitr and second tranche of investment to strengthen the 
                     Bureau’s ICT security and resilience and observations network announced in the

                          Expenses under the public debt interest sub-function are expected to decrease by 
                          2.7 per cent in real terms from 2018-19 to 20192-0 and decrease by 13.9 per cent from 
                          2019-20 to 20222-3. The decrease in expenses reflects a drop in expected iuancess  of

                          Budget Paper No. 1 provide further information on Government debt, including

                          Government’s annual borrowing task. Expenses under the nominal superannuation 
                          interest sub-function are projected to increase by 1.5 per cent from 2019-20 to 2022-23, 
                          reflecting the growth in the Australian Government’s superannuation liability. Further

                                                                       5-42

                          expected to grow by 8.0 per cent from 2019-20 to 2022-23. Nearly all of the expenses 
                          under this sub-function relate to general revenue assistance paid to state and territory 
                          governments, which comprise payments of GST entitlements provided on an ‘untied’ 
                          basis. Payments to state and territory governments tied to specific purposes are 
                          reported under the relevant sections in this statement. Further information on general 
                          revenue assistance to the states and territories can be found in Budget Paper No. 3,

                          Expenses under local government assistance relate to financial assistance grants made 
                          to the tas tes and territories and consist of a general purpose component and an 
                          identified local road component, both of which are untied, allowing councils to direct 
                          the grants to local priorities. The expenses are expected to decrease by 15.3 per cent in 
                          real terms from 201819 t-   o 20192-0, reflecting half of the expected 2019-20 Financial 
                          Assistance Grants being brought forward to enable the immediate use of these funds in 
                          2018-19, particularly in areas affected by severe or unexpected weather events .Further 
                          information on Australian Government assistance to local governments can be found

                          The  natural disaster relief sub-function reflects financial support provided by the 
                          Australian Government to affectedst ates and territories under the Natural Disaster 
                          Relief and Recovery Arrangements and, since November 2018, the Disaster Recovery 
                          Funding Arrangements. The profile over the forward estimates reflects the 
                          requirement under accounting standards to recognise the majority of expen sfeosr a 
                          disaster in the year in which it occurs. No provision is made for future disasters. 
                          Actual (cash) payments expected to be made tost ates and territories are outlined in 
                          Budget Paper No. 3. 
                          The contingency reserve sub-function comprises the Contingency Reserve, which is an 
                          allowance that principally reflects anticipated events that cannot be assigned to 
                          individual programs in the preparation of the Australian Government budget 
                          estimates. It is used to ensure that the estimates are based on the bfesortm iantion 
                          available at the time of the Budget. It is not a general policy reserve and is not 
                          appropriated.  
                          Allowances that are included in the Contingency Reserve can only be drawn upon 
                          once they have been appropriated by Parliament. These allowances are allocated to 
                          specific entities for appropriation closer to the time when the associated events occur. 
                          The  contingency reservesu  b-function in the 201-920 Budget reduces expenses by 
                          $216 million in 2019-20, and increases expenses by $2.1 billion in 2020-21, $4.3 billion in 
                          2021-22 and $9.0 billion in 2022-23. The largest component of this is the conservative 
                          bias allowance (CBA), which makes provision for the tendency for the estimate of 
                          expenses for existing Government policy to be revised upwards in the frwoard years. 
                          The 2019-20 Budget includes a provision of: 
                          •  zero in the Budget year 2019-20; 
                                                                     5-43 
                                  Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment 
                                  •    ½ of a percentage point of total general government sector expenses (excluding GST 
                                       payments to the States) in the first forward year 2020-21 ($2.2 billion); 
                                  •    1 per cent of expenses in the second forward year 2021-22 ($4.6 billion); and 
                                  •    2 per cent of expenses in the third forward year 2022-23 ($9.5 billion). 
                                  The drawdown of the CBA reduced expenses by 1$.1 billion in 2019-20; $1.0 billion in 
                                  2020-21 and $2.2 billion in 2021-22. This is consistent with long standing practice and 
                                  does not represent a saving. 
                                  The Contingency Reserve includes a provision of $13 m8 illion over four years from 
                                  2019-20 for the continuation of some expiring National Partnerships and possible 
                                  by-election costs for the Australian Electoral Commission. A provision is also included 
                                  for the effects of economic parameter revisions received too late in the process for 
                                  inclusion in entity estimates, and an underspends provision in 2018-19 that reflects the 
                                  tendency for budgeted expenses for some entities or functions not to be met. 
                                  The Contingency Reserve also includes estimates for measures that have been 
                                  announced but cannot yet be included in entity estimates, usually due to some 
                                  uncertainty as to their final cost and/or outcomes, or are subject to negotiations. 
                                  •    Significant expenditure itme s include a provision for the Indigenous Recognition

                          General government net capital investment  
                          Net capital investment is broadly defined as the sale and acquisition of nonfin-ancial 
                          assets less depreciation expenses. It provides a measure of the overall growth in capital 
                          assets (including buildings and infrastructure, specialist military equipment and 
                          computer software) after taking into account depreciation and amortisation as 
                          previously acquired assets age. 
                          Government capital spending involves acquisition of physical assets, financial assets 
                          and provision of grants and subsidies to others (primarily state and territory 
                          government), which they use to acquire assets.  
                          Australian Government general government sector net capital investment is expected 
                          to be $47 .billion in 2019-20,  $1.7 billion  lower  than the net capital investment in 
                          2018-19. This change is largely due to the auction by the Australian Communications 
                          and Media Authority of sptecrum licences in the 3  G.6Hz bands. Overall, the 
                          Government’s investment in capital assets is expected to continue to increase over the 
                          forward estimates.

                                  OVERVIEW 
                                  This statement provides information on current and projected Government debt and 
                                  the major assets and liabilities on the Government balance sheet. 
                                  Net debt in 2019-20 is expected to be $361 billion, representing 18 per cent of GDP. By 
                                  2022-23, net debt is expected to decline to $6.13 2billion (14.4 per cent of GDP). Net 
                                  debt is then projected to be eliminated over the medium term (2029-30). 
                                  The end-of-year face value of Australian Government Securit ies(AGS)1
                                                                                                                                                  on issue 
                                  subject to the Treasurers’ Direction is expected to be around $560 billion in 2019-20, 
                                  increasing  to  around  $569  billion in 2022-23. Total AGS on issue declines to 
                                  $416.8 billion by the end of the medium term (2029-30).  
                                  The Government’s total assets are estimated to be $611 billion in 2019-20, increasing to 
                                  $699.7 billion by the end of the forward estimates. Total liabilities are estimated to be 
                                  $944.3  billion in 2019-20  increasing  to  $967.2  billion by teh end of the forward 
                                  estimates. 
                                  DEBT STATEMENT 
                                  The Debt Statement provides information on estimated and projected Government net 
                                  debt, current and projected debt on issue and details of climate spending, including the 
                                  extent to which this spending has contributed to debt. 
                                  Australian Government Securities issuance 
                                  The Government finances its activities either through receipts orb y borrowing. When 
                                  receipts fall short of payments, the Government borrows by issuing AGS to investors. 
                                  The Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is responsible for issuing 
                                  AGS and managing the Government’s financing activities. The AOFM currently issues 
                                  three types of securities: 
                                  •    Treasury Bonds: medium-term to long-term securities with a fixed annual rate of 
                                       interest payable every six months; 
                                                                                             
                                  1   Previously referred to as Commonwealth Government Securities. 
                                                                                              6-3 
                                  Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
                                  •    Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs: m)                     edium-term to long-term securities for which 
                                       the capital value of the security is adjusted for movements in the consumer price 
                                       index (CPI). Interest on TIBs is paid quarterly, at a fixed rate, on the adjusted capital 
                                       value; and 
                                  •    Treasury Notes: short-term securities generally maturing within six months of 
                                       issuance. The volume of Treasury Notes on issue will vary over the course of the 
                                       year, depending on the size and profile of the within-year funding flows. 
                                  Within these three broad categories of AGS, issuance is undertaken into a limited 
                                  number of maturities (known as lines). Each of these lines has a fixed maturity date 
                                  (the date on which the Government repays the principal it has borrowed) and, for 
                                  Treasury Bonds and TIBs, a coupon rate (the annual fixed interest rate paid on 
                                  the security). 
                                  Concentrating  AGS  issuance into a limited number of lines (rather than issuing 
                                  securities with a specific time value, such as 10 years) ensures each line is sufficiently 
                                  large that it can be more readily traded in the secondary market. Strong liquidity in the 
                                  secondary market is attractive to investor sand intermediaries, promotes demand for 
                                  AGS and assists in lowering borrowing co stAs.ll AGS issuance is undertaken in 
                                  Australian dollars. 
                                  The AOFM exercises operational independence in the execution of its duties. Its 
                                  announced issuance program for each year is therefore determined on the basis of 
                                  maturing  AGS, net new issunce arequired to fund the Budg etand  operational 
                                  considerations. 
                                  Operational considerations often mean that the annual issuance program may not be 
                                  equivalent to the financing task for a particular year. For example, the AOFM may 
                                  decide there is merit in partially pfruen-ding the following yea’s fr                                   inancing task. 
                                  Alternatively, the AOFM might choose to smooth issuance across several financial 
                                  years in order to minimise changes in AGS supply from one financial year to the next. 
                                  The AOFM conducts regular buyback tenders for Treasury Bonds shorter than those 
                                  comprising the primary three year Treasury Bond futures contract. The buybacks are 
                                  funded by issuance of a corresponding fa vcealue amount of longe-rdated Treasury 
                                  Bonds. This operation assists the AOFM in its cash management task ahead of bond 
                                  maturities and contributes to an orderly and efficient Treasury Bond market. 
                                  In recent years, the AOFM has taken the opportunity to lengthen the AGS yield curve 
                                  to include a 30-year benchmark. This has provided for a lower risk profile of maturing 
                                  debt, further broadened the investor base,an d has been achieved during a period 
                                  when borrowing costs have been low by historical standards. 
                                                                                              6-4 
                                                                                           Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
                                  At times when AGS issuance is not required to finance te Gh overnment’s activities, 
                                  successive Governments have continued to issue AGS for policy purposes such as to 
                                  maintain a liquid AGS market. 
                                  The Government remains committed tmo aintaining a wel-lfunctioning and liquid 
                                  AGS  market. In particular, the Government will focus on ensuring a market of 
                                  sufficient size to maintain liquidity across the longer yield curve and to support the 
                                  Treasury Bond futures market and other important benchmarks. 
                                  A wel-lfunctioning and liquid AGS market also supports the development of state 
                                  government and corporate bond markets by providing a risk-free benchmark. 
                                  Estimates and projections of key debt aggregates 
                                  The level of current and projected Government debt on issue is commonly expressed 
                                  in one of two ways: gross or net debt. 
                                  Gross debt measures the face value of AGS on issue at a point in time. While gross 
                                  debt is measured in face value terms, estimates and projections of AGS on issue are 
                                  published in both face value and market value terms in this Statement. 
                                  •    The face value of AGS on issue is the amount that the Government pays back to 
                                                                                                                                        2
                                       investors at maturity, independent of fluctuations in market prices.
                                                                                                                                          The total face 
                                       value of AGS on issue changes when new securities are issued, or when securities 
                                       are repurchased or reach maturity. 
                                  •    The  market value  of  AGS  represents the value of securities as traded on the 
                                       secondary market, which changes continuously with movements in market prices. 
                                       Consistent with external reporting standards, the market value of AGS on issue is 
                                       reported on the Australian Government general government sector balance sheet. 
                                  Net debt is equal to the sum of deposits held, government securities (at market value), 
                                  loans and other borrowing, minus the sum of cash and deposits, advances paid and 
                                  investments, loans and placements. As net debt incorporates both selected financial 
                                  assets and liabilities at their fair value, it provides a broader measure of the financial 
                                  obligations of the Commonwealth than gross debt. 
                                  Not all government assets or liabilities are included in the measurement of net debt. 
                                  For example the Government’s unfunded superannuation liability is not accounted for 
                                  in net debt. 
                                                                                             
                                  2   For TIBs, the final repayment amount paid to investors includes an additional amount owing 
                                       to inflation growth over the life of the security. This amount is not included in the calculation 
                                       of face value. 
                                                                                              6-5

                          In 2019-20, net debt is expected to b36e $1 billion (18 per cent of GDP) and is then 
                          projected to decline to $326.1 billion (14.4 per cent of GDP) in 2022-23.

                          Table 2 shows the drivers of the change in net debt between the 201-819 MYEFO and 
                          the 2019-20 Budget. 
                          Consistent with the 201-19 MY8         EFO, net debt is expected  to  decrease across the 
                          forward estimates but is higher than at MYEFO reflecting a rise in the market value of 
                          AGS due to lower yields.

                             Net debt is projected to declinef rom 19.2 per cent of GDP ($373.5 billion) in 2018-19 to 
                             0 per cent of GDP (-$1.2 billion) by the end of the medium term (2029-30) (Chart 1). Net 
                             debt is projected to be 2.1  per cent of GDP (6$3.9 billion) in 2028-29,  higher  than 
                             projected net debt of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2028-29 at the 2018-19 MYEFO. The change 
                             in net debt since the 2018-19 MYEFO is primarily due to a rise in the market value of 
                             AGS due to lower yields.

                             the market value (end-of-year) of AGS on issue. 
                             The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 (CIS Act) requires the Treasurer to issue a 
                                                                                                                                      4
                             direction stipulating the maximum face value of relevant AGS that may be on issue.
                                                                                                                                        
                             As required by the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998, Table 3 reports projections of 
                             AGS on issue subject to the Treasurer’s Direction. 
                             When considering these projections, it is important to note that the AOFM publishes 
                             an issuance program for the budget year only. Projections beyond the budget year are 
                             based on a set of technical assumptions and will vary with changes to these 
                             assumptions and budget estimates and projections. 
                                                                                        
                             3   End-of-year values are estimates or projections of AGS on issue at 30 June for the particular 
                                 year. The precise timing and level of wit-yheainr peaks of AG  Son issue cannot be 
                                 determined with accuracy. The timing of the within-year peak is therefore reported to th e
                                 given month in the particular year. 
                             4   On 9 May 2017, the Treasurer directed that the maximum face value of AGS that can be on 
                                 issue is $600 billion. 
                                                                                6-7

                           The total face value of AGS on issue (gross debt) is projected to fall from 28.1 per cent 
                           of GDP ($546b illion) in 201-819 to 12.8 per cent of GDP ($416.8 billion) by 2029-30 
                           (Chart 2). The face value of AGS on issue is projected to reach 15.1 per cent of GDP 
                           ($469.4 billion)  by 202-289,  higher  than the 14.6pe  r cent of GD  pProjected at the 
                           2018-19 MYEFO. The increase in the total face value of AGS across the medium term is 
                           largely due to movements in the projected underlying cash balance.

                               Interest on AGS 
                               The interest costs related to AGS are presented in these statements in both cash and 
                               accrual accounting terms. The difference between the cash interest payments and 
                               accrual interest expense generally relates to the timing of when the interest cost is 
                               recognised. 
                               •    Interest payments are recognised in the period when they are paid during the life 
                                    of the security. 
                               •    Interest expense is recognised in the period in which an expense is incurred during 
                                    the life of the security, rather when it is actually paid. 
                               Estimates of the interest payments and expense of AGS on issue include the cost of 
                               AGS already on issue and future AGS issuance. The cost of: 
                               •   AGS already on issue uses the actual interest rates incurred at the time of issuance; 
                                   and 
                               •   the expected future issuance of AGS is based on the prevailing market rates across 
                                   the yield curve at the time of a budget estimates update. 
                               The assumed market yields for the 2019-20 Budget result in a weighted average cost of 
                               borrowing of around 1.9 per cent for future issuance of Treasury Bonds in the forward 
                               estimates period, compared with around 2.5 per cent at the 2018-19 MYEFO.

                      The Government’s interest payments and expense over the forward estimates mostly 
                      relate to the cost of servicing the stock of AGS on issue. 
                      The Government’s total interest payments in 2019-20 are estimated to be $16.6 billion, 
                      of which $16.4 billion relates to AGS on issue (Table 9).

                          (a)  Spending in this table is on a headline cash balance basis — that is, payments and net cash flows from 
                              investments in financial assets for policy purposes, as well as estimated interest receipts associated with 
                              Clean Energy Finance Corporation investments. 
                          (b)  These figures do not include expected repayments from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation  over the 
                              forward estimates. 
                           
                          The key components of climate spending are: 
                          •   the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which invests in renewable energy, energy 
                              efficiency and low emissions technologies; 
                          •   the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which supports research and 
                              development of renewable energy and related technologies; and 
                          •   the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers legislation to reduce carbon 
                              emissions and increase the use of clean energy. 
                          The above figures incorporate the Government’s decision to provide $3.5 billion over 
                          15 years from 2018-19 for a Climate Solutions package, which provides incentives to 
                          support abatement activities across the economy. 
                                                                       6-15 
                          Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
                          Impact of climate spending on debt 
                          Climate spending is financed through either receipts or debt. This Statement assumes 
                          that the proportion of climate spending being financed through new debt (as opposed 
                          to receipts) is equivalent to the proportion of taol spt    ending financed by debt. This is 
                          shown in Table 12.

                                                         an acceptable, but not excessive, level of risk for the FutureF und, measured in terms

                        To date, $9 billion has been credited to the MRFF. Remaining credits to the MRFF will 
                        consist of the estimated value of health savings published in the-1 25 B014udget, 
                        adjusted for the effect o fany subsequent associated Government decisions, until the 
                        capital value of the MRFF reaches $20 billion. The MRFF is expected to reach a balance

                        Earnings available for drawdown from the MRFF are determined by the Future Fund 
                        Board of Guardians (the Board) taking into account the requirement to maintain the 
                        value of credits to the Fund over the long term. Payments met from drawdowns will 
                        be determined through the annual budget process. 
                        The MRFF is managed by the Board. The Treasurer and Mniister for Finance and the 
                        Public Service have set an Investment Mandate for the MRFF, which provides broad

                        DisabilityCare Australia Fund 
                        The DisabilityCare Australia Fund (DCAF) was established on 1 July 2014 to assist the 
                        Commonwealth and the State and Territory governments with spending directly 
                        related to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). This is consistent with the 
                        commitment by governments to roll out the NDIS across Australia. 
                        The DCAF is funded by revenue raised from the increase in the Medicare levy of half a 
                        percentage point to 2 per cent that was implemented on 1 July 2014.                            As at
                        31 December 2018, the DCAF has received credits totalling $14.3 billion. 
                        The investments of the DCAF are managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians 
                        (the Board). The Treasurer and Minister for Financea nd the Public Service have set an 
                        Investment Mandate for the DCA, Fwhich came into effect from  1July 2014 and 
                        provides guidance to the Board in relation to its investment strategy for the DCAF. The 
                        DCAF Investment Mandate sets a benchmark return on theDC  AF of the Australian 
                        three-month bank bill swap rate plus 0.3 per cent per annum calculated on a rolling 
                        12-month basis (net of fees). In achieving its objectives, the Board must invest in such a 
                        way as to minimise the probability of capital losses over a 12-month horizon. 
                        For the 12 month period ending 31 December 2018, the DCAF’s return was 2.2 per cent 
                        against the benchmark of 2 .2per  cent. The DCAF was valued at $14.4 billi on at
                        31 December 2018. 
                                                                6-18 
                                                                 Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
                        As at 31 December2018,      payments totalling $551m  illion were made to reimburse 
                        those States and Territories that had signed the National Partnership on DisabilityCare 
                        Australian Fund Payments: Initial Payment. All State and Territory governments will be 
                        able to draw down from the DCAF when they meet key conditions, such as agreeing to 
                        fully roll out the NDIS and milestones relating to the participation in the scheme of 
                        people with significant and premanent disability. The balance of the DCAF, after 
                        taking into account allocations to the States and Territories, will be available to the 
                        Commonwealth to assist with meeting the Commonwealth’s contribution to the NDIS. 
                        Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund 
                        The Government established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea 
                        Future Fund (ATSILSFF) on 1 February 2019 to support payments to the Indigenous 
                        Land and Sea Corporation (ILSC). 
                        The ATSILSFF was seeded with the capital of the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
                        Islander Land Account (Land Account) — approximately $2 billion. The Land Account 
                        was abolished on the establishment of the ATSILSFF. 
                        The  investments of the  ATSILSFF  are  managed by the Future Fund Board of 
                        Guardians (the Board). Following consultation with the Minister for Indigenous 
                        Affairs and the Board, the Treasurer and the Minister for Fin aannced the Public 
                        Service  issued  an Investment Mandate for the ATSILFF,S  which sets a lotnermg-  
                        benchmark return of CPI + 2.0 to 3.0 per cent per annum, net of costs. 
                        Future Drought Fund 
                        The Government will establish the Future Drought Fund (FDF) on 1 July 2019 to fund 
                        initiatives that enhance future drought resilience, pprearedness and response across 
                        Australia. 
                        The FDF will be seeded with the uncommitted balance of the Building Australia Fund 
                        (BAF) — approximately $3.9 billion. The BAF will be abolished on the establishment of 
                        the FDF. By 2028-29, the FDF is expecetd to grow to approximately $5 billion through 
                        reinvestment of net earnings.T  he Fund will provide disbursements of $100 million 
                        per annum from 1 July 2020. 
                        The investments of the FDF will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians 
                        (the Board). Following consultation with the Board, the Treasurer and the Minister for 
                        Finance  and the Public Service will set an Investment Mandate for the FDF. The 
                        Investment Mandate will provide strategic guidance to the Board on the Government’s 
                        expectations for the investmenoft  the FDF, including the level of risk that the 
                        Government is prepared to accept in pursuit of target returns. 
                        Emergency Response Fund 
                        The Government will establish the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) on 1 October 2019 
                        to fund initiative swhich enhance future national disaster response and recovery 
                        efforts across Australia. 
                                                                  6-19 
           Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
           The ERF will be seeded with the uncommitted balance of the Education Investment 
           Fund (EIF) – approximately $3.9 billion. The EIF will be abolished on establishment of 
           the ERF. Potential disbursements from the ERF will be up to $150 million from 2019-20 
           to 20232-4 following a significanta nd catastrophic natural disaster in Australia. The 
           ERF will only be drawn down in this way where the Government determines there is a 
           need for additionasul pport in parallel with existing national disaster response 
           programs. From 20232-4, the maximum potential disbursements from the ERF would 
           be restricted to the average value of the annual net realised earnings of the Fund over 
           the previous five years. 
           The investments of the ERF will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians 
           (the Board). Following consultation with the Board, the Treasurer and the Minster for 
           Finance and the Public Service will set an investment mandate for the ERF. The 
           investment mandate will provide strategic direction to the Board on the Government’s 
           expectations for investment of the ERF, including the level of risk the Government is 
           prepared to accept in pursuit of target returns. 
           National Broadband Network 
           The National Broadband Network (NBN) will deliver fast and affordable broadband to 
           all Australians. The Government has instructed NBN Co Limited (NBN  Co)  to 
           complete the NBN using the technology best matched to each area of Australia to 
           ensure that the NBN is delivered as soon as possible and at least cost to taxpayers. 
           The Government provided the final $2 billion of its $29.5 billion equity contribution to 
           NBN Co in 2017-18. 
           The Government has agreed to provide a loan of up to $19.5 billion to NBCoN  on 
           commercial terms. The Government has agreed to extend the duration of its loan by 
           three years (from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2024) and to allow NBN Co to access up to 
           $2 billion of private sector debt. The expected drawdown by NBN Co on the 
           Government loan is $5.7 billion in 2019-20. 
           Higher Education Loan Programme 
           The Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) comprises concessional loans to 
           students that enable them to defer payment of fees for diploma level ande  abov
           courses, which are paid back once the loan recipient is earninn ig ancome above a 
           certain level. 
           The fair value of HELP is estimated to be around $46.1 billion at 30 June 2019, which 
           is $0.3 billion lower than projected in the 20181-9 MYEFO. The fair value of HELP is 
           projected to grow to around $53.2 billion by 30 June 2022, which is $1.9 billion lower 
           than estimated in the 2081-19 MYEFO, and to reach $55.3 billion by the end of the 
           forward estimates. 
                              6-20 
                             Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
           The lower than expected growth in the fair value of HELP to 30 June 2019 is largely a 
           result of higher than expected loan repayments. 
           From 1 January 2020, a combined HELP loan limit will replace the FEE-HELP limit and 
           will include FEE-HELP, VET Student Loans, VET FEE-HELP and HECS-HELP. 
           Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
           The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) was established as a Commonwealth 
           Authority in August 2012 through the Clean Energy Finance Cortipoonra Act 2012 
           (CEFC Act). 
           Under the CEFC Act the CEFC has been provided $10 billion to invest in renewable 
           energy, low emissions technology and energy efficiency projects. 
           The CEFC continues to invest funds and manage its investments. Investment decisions 
           are made by an independent board consistent with the CEFC Act and the C’s EFC
           investment mandate. 
           Liabilities 
           The Government’s total liabilities are estimated to be $922.6 billion at 30 June 2019, 
           increasing to $944.3 billion in 2019-20 and $967.2 billion by the end of the forward 
           estimates. 
           The Government’s major liabilities are AGS  on issue and public sector employee 
           superannuation liabilities. 
           Public sector employee superannuation liabilities 
           Public sector employee superannuation entitlements relating to past and present 
           civilian employees and military personnel are a financial liability on the Government’s 
           balance sheet. The Government’s superannuation liabilities are estimated to be around 
           $224 billion at 30 June 2019 and approximately $316 billion at 30 June 2050. 
           These liabilities represent the present value of future unfunded superannuation 
           benefits and are based on an actuarially determined discount rate. Th-te ermlon g
           nature of the unfunded superannuation liabilities requires the use of a discount rate 
           that best matches the duration of the liabilities. The use of a long-term discount rate for 
           budget purposes avoids the volatility that would occur by using current market yields 
           on Government bonds, which continually change. The value recorded on the balance 
           sheet is highly sensitive to the discount rate used. 
           Consistent with the latest Long Term Cost Reports for the civilian and military 
           schemes, the discount rate currently applied is 5 per cent per annum. 
                              6-21 
           Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities 
           The Australian Government has never fully funded its superannuation liabilities in 
           relation to defined benefit schemes. However, the Future Fund was established in 2006 
           to help finance the Government’s unfunded superannuation liabilities. 
           For civilian employees, the major defined benefit schemes are the Commonwealth 
           Superannuation Scheme (CSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS). 
           These schemes were closed to new members in 1990 and 2005 respectively. The Public 
           Sector Superannuation accumulation plan (PSSap) was introduced on 
           1 July 2005 and provides fully funded accumulation benefits for new civilian 
           employees from that date. 
           For military personnel, the defined benefit schemes are the Defence Force Retirement 
           and Death Benefits Scheme (DFRDB), the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme 
           (DFRB) and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). Following the 
           closure of the MSBS on 30 June 2016, all defined benefit military schemes are now 
           closed to new members. A new military superannuation accumulation scheme, ADF 
           Super, commenced on 1 July 2016. ADF Super is accompanied by a statutory death and 
           disability arrangement ADF cover. 
           While there have not been any new members to the public service and military defined 
           benefit schemes since closure in 2005 and 2016 respectively, the value of the 
           Government’s unfunded superannuation liabilities is projected to continue growing (in 
           nominal terms) into the immediate future —a lthough it is projected to decrease as a 
           proportion of GDP. It is forecast to reach $51 2billion by the end of the forward 
           estimates. The increase in the liabilities partly results from the time value of money 
           which recognises future benefits being closer to maturity each year. It also results from 
           the accruing entitlements to current members of the civilian and military defined 
           benefit schemes, and members covered by the statutory death and disability 
           arrangement ADF cover. 
           As the superannuation liabilities are included in the Governmen’ts net worth and net 
           financial worth aggregates, revaluations of the liabilities have an impact on these 
           aggregates (see Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statem efnorts 
           further information about budget aggregation).

                                    The economic and fiscal estimates presented in the 2019-20  Budget incorporate 
                                    assumptions and judgments based on information avaailat thble e time of

                                    This Statement provides details of the historical performance of Budget forecasts for 
                                    the macroeconomic aggregates of real and nominal GDP as well as for estimates of 
                                    government receipts. The Statement also presents a number of scenarios seeking to 
                                    illustrate the sensitivity of budget aggregates to changes in ecnoo mic forecasts and 
                                    projections and some underlying assumptions.

                       STATEMENT 7: FORECASTING PERFORMANCE AND 
                                         SCENARIO ANALYSIS 
                   OVERVIEW 
                   Macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts are important for government policy and decision 
                   making.  The macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts in the Budget are based on 
                   information available at the time o fpreparation, which also informs assumptions and 
                   judgments. Better forecasting and a better understanding of the uncertainties around 
                   the forecasts contribute to better policy and decision making. 
                   This Statement assesses the historical performance of budget forecasts and estimates of 
                   uncertainty around these forecasts. This assessment is consistent with the practice of 
                   many other international fiscal agencies to improve forecasting performance and, more 
                   importantly, to raise awareness of the uncertainties inherent in forecasting. 
                   The fiscal estimates presented in the Budget are underpinned by sho-rtterm economic 
                   forecasts for the current financial year, the budget year and the subsequent financial 
                   year, and economic projections for the following two years. These five years are 
                   followed by medium-term projections for a further seven years to provide an 
                   indication of the longe-rterm fiscal trajectory. The economic projections, which are 
                   generated by retruning economic activity to its potential level over an adjustment 
                   period, underpin the medium-term fiscal projections (Chart 1).

           Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Scenario Analysis 
           FORECASTING PERFORMANCE 
           Macroeconomic forecasting performance 
           The Government’s macroeconomic forecasts are prepared using a range of modelling 
           techniques including macroeconometric models, spreadsheet analysis and accounting 
           frameworks. These are augmentedb y survey data, business liaison, professional 
           opinion and judgment. 
           Forecasts are subject to inherent uncertainties. Generally, these uncertainties tend to 
           increase as the forecast horizon lengthens. Forecast errors (the differ enbetcewseen 
           forecasts and outcomes) can arise for a range of reas o—n sfor example, differences 
           between the assumed path of key variables and outcomes, changes in the relationships 
           between different parts of the economy and unexpected events. 
           Confidence intervals seek to illustrate that there is a range of plausible outcomes 
           around any forecast. Confidence intervals are based on observed historical patterns of 
           forecast errors. They are a guide to the degree of uncertainty around a forecast andca  n 
           span a wide range of outcomes. 
           Real GDP forecasts 
           Real  GDP forecasts factor in a number of assumption sin, cluding exchange rates, 
           interest rates and commodity prices. The forecasts also incorporate judgments about 
           how developments in one part of the economy affect other parts and how the domestic 
           economy is affected by events in the internatilona economy. The accuracy of the 
           forecasts  is  influenced  by  the extent to which the assumptions and judgments 
           underpinning them prove to be correct —an d also the reliability of the economic 
           relationships embodied in the macroeconomic models used to produce the  Fmor. 
           example, an exchange rate that is lower than assumed would be expected to result in 
           higher-than-forecast GDP growth.  
           Forecast errors for real GDP can also result from unexpected shifts in the pace or 
           nature of economic activity during tsth pe ferioorecd. a For exampl e, a
           faster-than-expected  pick-up in Australia’s economic growth in 201920 -could be 
           driven by stronger consumer spending, underpinned by fastertha- n-expected growth 
           in employment and wages. Faster economic growth could also be driven by 
           stronger-than-expected major trading partner growth, which could boost exports and, 
           in turn, stimulate incomes and demand throughout the economy.

                        Over the past 20 years, the Budget forecasts of real GDP growth have exhibited little 
                        evidence of bias, with the mean absolute forecast error being insignificantly different 
                        from zero. While forecasts of real GDP growth were less accurate in the years during 
                        and immediately after the global financial crisis (GFC), forecast errors have been 
                        smaller in recent years (Chart 2).

                        Chart 3 shows that the average annualised growth rate of real GDP in the two years 
                        to 2019-20  is expected to be around ½2  per cent, with the 70 per cent ciodnefnce 
                        interval ranging from 1¾ per cent to 3¼ per cent. In other words, if forecast errors are 
                        similar to those made over recent years, there is a 70 per cent probability that the 
                        growth rate will lie in this range.

                           Nominal GDP forecasts 
                           Compared with real GDP forecasts, nominal GDP forecasts are subject to additional 
                           sources of uncertainty from the evolon utiof domestic prices and wage, ps rices of 
                           imported goods and world prices for Australia’s exports, including commodities. 
                           Since  the early 2000s, nominal GDP forecast errors have reflected the greater 
                           difficulties in predicting movements in global commodity pCrichaes (rt  4).  From 
                           2011-12  to 2015-16,  as key commodity prices were falling from their record h, ighs
                           larger-than-expected falls in the terms of trade meant that nominal GDPg rowth was 
                           overestimated.  However, the outcomes for nominal GDP growth in 2-17 an016 d 
                           2017-18 were higher than were forecast in the Budgets for those yea.r Ts his primarily

                            forecasts and projections, as well as estimates of the impact of governmentsp  ending 
                            and revenue measures. Changes to the economic or demographic  forecasts and 
                            projections underlying the estimates will affect forecasts for receipts and payments. As 
                            such, this will have a direct impact on the profile of the underlying cash balance and 
                            government debt. Even small movements in economic forecandsts p arojections or 
                            outcomes that differ from the forecasts and projections can result in large changes to 
                            the budget aggregates. 
                            Receipts 
                            Tax receipts estimates are generally prepared using a b‘ase plus growth’ methodology. 
                            The last known outcome (2017-18 for the 2019-20 Budget) is used as the base to which 
                            estimated growth rates are applied, resulting in tax receipts estimates for the current 
                            and future years. Estimates for the current year also incorporate recent trends in tax 
                            collections. 
                            Most of the indirect heads of revenue, such as GST and fuel excise, are forecast by 
                            mapping the growth rate of an appropriate economic parameter directly to the tax 
                            growth rate in the relevant head of revenue. A number of income taxes also involve 
                            determining whether this tax will be paid in the year the income is earned, such as for 
                            pay-as-you-go withholding tax, or in future years, such as for individuals’ refunds.

                             The forecast for 2018-19 tax receipts (excluding CGT) in the 2018-19 Budget is expected 
                             to be an underestimate of around 1.3 percentage points, compared with an 
                             underestimate of around 1.6 percentage points for nominal non-farm GDP growth. 
                             The largest contributor to the expected forecast error for 2018-19 is company tax, which 
                             is estimated to be $4.6 billion (5.2 per cent) higher than expected in the 2018-19 Budget. 
                             This is primarily driven by higher-than-expected company profits, including upward 
                             revisions to profits in 2-18 an017               d 20119. Gr8-     oss income tax withholding is

                             Payments 
                             The Government’s payments estimates are predominantly prepared by agencies that 
                             comprise the Australian Government general government sector. An assessment of 
                             payments forecasting performance is not included in this Statement. However, 
                             historical errors have been incorporated in estimated confidence intervals. 
                             Chart 9 shows confidence intervals around payments forecasts (excluding GST). As 
                             with receipts estimates, historical variations caused by subsequent policy decisions are

                             decisions and a provision for contingencies.3

                                 impact of natural disasters or changes to the timing of projects announced in previous 
                                 updates. These decisions will contribute to historical forecast errors and therefore increase 
                                 the size of the confidence intervals around payments. 
                             3   The impacts of past policy decisions on historical public debt interest through time cannot be 
                                 readily identified or estimated. For this reason, no adjustment has been made to exclude

                             Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Scenario Analysis 
                             The chart shows that there is moderate uncertainty around payments forecasts. In 
                             2019-20, the width of the 70 per cent confidence interval for the20  B2019udg-et 
                             payments forecast is approximately   p0e.8r cent of GDP (16 $billion) and the 
                             90 per cent confidence interval is approximately 1.3 per cent of GDP ($25.3 billion). 
                             Payments outcomes can differ from forecasts for a number of reasons. Demanddri- ven 
                             programs, such as payments to individuals for social welfare, form the bulk of 
                             government expenditure. Forecasts of payments associated with a number of these 
                             government programs depend on forecasts of economic conditions. For example, 
                             higher than forecast unemployment levels will mean that expenditure for related social 
                             services payments, including allowances, will be higher than forecast. 
                             Underlying cash balance 
                             The underlying cash balance estimates are sensitive to the same forecastrr eors that 
                             affect estimates of receipts and payments. Confidence interval analysis shows that 
                             there is considerable uncertainty around the underlying ch bas alance forecasts 
                             (Chart 10). 
                             In 2019-20, the width of the 70 per cent confidence interval for the 202019 B- udget 
                             underlying cash balance forecast is approximately 2 .1per cent of GDP ($41.1 billion) 
                             and the 90 per cent confidence interval is approximately 3.3  per cent of GDP 
                             ($65.2 billion). In line with receipts forecasts, uncertainty increases over  the
                             estimates period.

                      Small movements in economic forecasts or projections can improve or worsen the 
                      underlying cash balance, depending on their impacts on payments and receipts. This 
                      in turn can drive changes in gross and net debt. Consiedration of particular scenarios 
                      and sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of these changes. The 
                      analysis presented considers the impact of changes to the economic outlook over the 
                      forecast years to 2020-21 and the projections beyond that. 
                      Scenarios 1 and 2 explore the sensitivity of fiscal aggregates to alternative paths for the 
                      terms of trade and consumption growth. 
                      Scenarios  3  and  4  illustrate the sensitivity of fiscal aggregates to changes in 
                      assumptions underpinning the medium-term economic projections. 
                      Scenario 5 illustrates the sensitivity of fiscal aggregates to changes in market yields. 
                      Sensitivity analysis over the forecast period 
                      The following two scenarios  provide  an  indication of the sensitiv itoyf receipts, 
                      payments and the underlying cash balance to changes in the economic outlook over 
                      the forecast period to 2020-21.

                      contained in Budget Statement 2: Economic Outlook. 
                      Scenario 1: Alternative paths for the terms of trade 
                      This scenario considers the consequences of a permanent 1 pe0r cent movement in 
                      world prices of norurna-l commodity exports through 2-2001 rel9     ative to the 
                      2019-20 Budget forecast levels. The scenario assumes that there is no change in the 
                      exchange rate or interest rates. Under a floating exchange rate, however, a change in 
                      the terms of trade would be expected to lead to a movement of the exchange rate in the 
                      same direction. This would mitigate the effects on real GDP, meaning the impact on 
                      the fiscal position would be smaller than presented below. 
                      Such a price rise (fall) is consistent with a rise (fall) in the terms of trade of 5¼ per cent 
                      and an increase (decrease) in nominal GDP of 1¼ per cent by 2020-21. The change in 
                      the terms of trade from a 10 per cent movement in non-rural commodity exports varies 
                      over time in line with the share of those exports in total exports. The setnsy itivi
                      analysis shows the flow-on effects to GDP, the labour market and prices. The impacts 
                      in Table 1 are stylised and refer to percentage deviations from the Budget forecast 
                      levels due to a permanent rise in n-rounral commodity prices. The impacts on the 
                      economy of a permanent fall in these prices of the same magnitude would be broadly 
                      symmetric.

                              Under this scenario, which assumes no change in exchange rates or interest rates, the 
                              increase in export prices leads directly to higher overall output prices (as measured by 
                              the GDP deflator) and higher domestic incomes compared with Budget levels. Higher 
                              domestic incomes cause both consumpton ai               nd investment to rise, resulting in higher 
                              real GDP and employment and an increase in wages. The rise in aggregate demand 
                              puts upward pressure on domestic prices. 
                              On the receipts side, an increase in nominal GDP increases tax collections. The largest 
                              impact is on company tax receipts as the increase in export income increases company 
                              profits. The impact on company tax is larger in 202021-, partly owing to lags in tax 
                              collections and a larger impact on company profits in the second year of the scenario. 
                              On the payments side, a significant proportion of government expenditure is partially 
                              indexed to movements in costs (as reflected in various price and wage indicators). 
                              Many forms of expenditure, in particular income support payments, are also driven by 
                              the number of beneficiaries. 
                              The overall estimated expenditure on income support payments (including pensions, 
                              unemployment benefits and other allowances) decreases in both years, refngl aect i
                              lower number of unemployment benefit recipients. The fall in spending on 
                              unemployment benefits is partially offset by increased expenditure on pensions and 
                              allowances reflecting stronger growth in benefit payment rates, resulting from slightly 
                              higher inflation. At the same time other payments linked to inflation are also higher in 
                              line with the stronger growth in prices. 
                              Given these assumptions, the overall impact of the increasei n the terms of trade is an 
                              improvement in the underlying cash balance of around2 $.3 billion in 201920-  and 
                              around $6.7  billion in 202021-   (see Table 2).  Broadly  opposite impacts would be 
                              expected for a fall in the terms of trade of the same magnitude.

                          The specific impact of a US$10 per tonne free-on-board (FOB) higher or lower iron ore 
                          price is outlined in Box 1. 
                           Box 1: Sensitivity analysis of iron ore price movements 
                           The impacts of a US$10 per tonne FOB movement in iron ore prices over the course 
                           of a year is set out in Table A. This is based on the sensitivity analysis presented in 
                           Scenario 1, and is calibrated to take into account the share of iron ore in the value of 
                           total exports, which can change over time. An increase of US$10 per tonne FOB in the 
                           iron ore price results in an increase in nominal GDP of around $6.3 billion in 2019-20 
                           and over $13 billion in 2020-21. Similarly, a decrease of US$10 per tonne FOB in the 
                           iron ore price results in a decrease in nominal GDP of an equivalent amount.

                          This scenario considers the economic and fiscal impacts of a change in household 
                          consumption growth in 20-1209 , consistent with a shift in household saving 
                          preferences. The scenario is a t-sidwedo sensitivity analysis, where the low 
                          consumption growth analysis illustrates the consequences of households shifting their

                              occur if, for example,ho       useholds reduce consumption in response to lower housing 
                              prices. The high consumption growth analysis illustrates the consequences of 
                              households reducing their rate of saving by more than forste cain the Budget, for

                              consumption growth has exceeded household income growth for several years, 
                              resulting in a decline in the household saving ratio4 f  preorm c 8.ent in the 
                              June quarter 2014 to 2.5 per cent in the December quarter 2018. At the same time, 
                              year-average growth in household consumption remains below it20s -year average 
                              rate, which is also true on a per capita basis. The Budget forecasts assume that the 
                              household saving ratio will be broadly flat over the forecast period. 
                              For the scenario, household consumption growth in 2019-20 has been adjusted so that, 
                              by the end of 2019-20, the level of consumption is either 1 per cent lower or higher than 
                                                                                    5

                              would be implied by the direct effect of the fall in consumption as imports also fall. As

                           On the receipts side, the reduction in consumption immediately affects indirect taxes, 
                           particularly goods and services tax. Business income falls in both years but the impact 
                           on company tax receipts is larger in the second year, owing to lags in tax collections. 
                           Lower employment and wages lead to lower tax receipts from individuals’ salary and 
                           wage withholding taxes. 
                           On the payments side, overall estimated expenditure on income support payments is 
                           higher in both years due to a higher number of unemployment benefit recipients. The 
                           increase in spending on unemployment benefits is partially offset by decreased 
                           expenditure on pensions and allowances reflecting slightly lower inflation in 20-2201. 
                           In addition, other payments linked to inflation are also lower in line with the weaker 
                           growth in prices. 
                           The overal limpact of the low-tehar n-anticipated picku-p in consumption is a 
                           deterioration  in  the underlying cash balance of around $0.8 billion in 201920-   and 
                           around $2.8  billion in2020    -21  (see Table 4). A highe-trhan-anticipated pick-up in 
                           consumption would havea  broadly opposite effec ton the underlying cash balance

                           Sensitivity analysis over the medium term 
                           The medium-term fiscal projection period is the seven years after the Budget forward 
                           estimates.  These fiscal  projections are underpinned by economic projectionosf  key 
                           economic variables. 
                                                                        7-17 
                      Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Scenario Analysis 
                      A distinction is drawn between economic forecasts and economic projections. The 
                      forecasts are based on a range of sh-rourtn forecasting methodologies informed by 
                      professional opinion, information from business liaison and broader judgment. By 
                      contrast, the economic projections are based on a medium-term methodology which 
                      returns economic activity to its potential level over and ajustment period. An 
                      important assumption underpinning the economic projections is that specific 
                      government policies do not change. 
                      Economic projections framework 
                      Treasury’s medium-term economic projection methodology assumes that any spare 
                      capacity remaining in the economy at the end of the forecast period will be absorbed 
                      over the following five years (the adjustment period). Over this period, productivity 
                      and labour force variables, including employment and the participation rate, are 
                      assumed to converge to their potential levels as real GDP returns to its estimated 
                      potential level. Treasury continues to review the methodology. 
                      Potential GDP is estimated based on analysis of underlying trends for population, 
                      productivity and participation. The Budget forecasts imply that the level of real GDP 
                      will be lower than potential GDP at the end of the forecast period —th  at is, there will 
                      be a negative output gap. To close the estimated output gap and absorb forecast spare 
                      capacity in the economy, real GDP is projceted to grow faster than potential over the 
                      adjustment period (over the five years from 2021-22). By the end of the adjustment 
                      period, the output gap is assumed to have closed completely and real GDP grows at its 
                      potential rate thereafter. 
                      Fiscal projections framework 
                      Treasury’s medium-term fiscal projections use the Budget forward estimates as a base. 
                      They are therefore subject to similar risks and uncertainties that affect the fiscal 
                      aggregates discussed earlier in this Statement, but the longer timeframes mean these 
                      risks and uncertainties can be amplified. 
                      Beyond the forward estimates, a range of simplifying assumptions are used to project 
                      government receipts and payments. The main drivers are movements in economic 
                      growth, the size and structure of the popul aatinod pn,   rices. The medium-term 
                      economic projections are a driver of the fiscal projections. For payments, a key 
                      parameter is expected per person costs (in each age bracket) of major government 
                      programs based on current policy. The projections assume current policy does not 
                      change. 
                      Changes to the assumptions underpinning Treasury’s estimate of Australia’s potential 
                      GDP — as well as the pace of adjustment back to potential —c an have large impacts 
                      on the fiscal procjetions. The following section illustrates the sensitivity of fiscal 
                      aggregates to these assumptions over the medium-term projection period. 
                                                            7-18 
                                                             Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Scenario Analysis 
                           Potential growth scenarios 
                           Scenarios 3 and 4: Alternative pathways for potential GDP 
                           As noted above, the estimate of potential GDP underpins projections of real GDP in 
                           the medium-term economic projection methodology. The Budget projections are based 
                           on an estimate of the growth rate of potential GDP of 2¾ per cent over the next few 
                           years. Variations in productivity, population or participation could lead to a lower or 
                           higher estimate of potential GDP growth. Indeed, a number of the components are 
                           currently some way from their estimated potential levels, which increases the 
                           uncertainty around the estimates. In light of this, Scenarios 3 and 4 examine the 
                           impacts of higher and lower potential GDP. 
                           Scenario 3 assumes potential GDP grows at 3 per cent, which is ¼ of a percentage point 
                           higher than the Budget projections in the medium term (Chart 11). This change could 
                           come from one or a combination of the components that make up potential growth. 
                           The numbers presented below are calculated off a change in productivity growth, as 
                           that has the greatest fiscal impact. The Budget projections a  thssuat pme otential 
                           productivity growth is 1.5 per cent in the long run, in line with its 3-y0ear average. 
                           This scenario assumes long-run productivity growth is ¼ of a percentage point higher.   
                           By the end of the projection period in 2-3002,9 the level of rea  GlDP is around 
                           2¼ per cent higher compared with the Budget projections. Higher labour productivity 
                           growth flows through to higher wages. Nominal GDP rises in line with real GDP as 
                           there is only a small effect on wages per unit of output (nominal unit labour costs) and, 
                           in turn, prices.

           Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Scenario Analysis 
           The higher level of nominal GDP means higher projected tax receipts over the 1-0year 
           period to 202930- .  Payments are projected to be lower overall drivenl boweyr  
           projected unemployment which reduces unemployment benefit recipient numbers. 
           Overall, the higher potential grow tihn Scenario 3  has a positive impact on the 
           underlying cash balance (Chart 12). In this scenario, the underlying csh ba alance is 
           0.4 percentage points of GDP higher at the end of the medium term, compared with 
           the baseline projection. 
           The variation in the underlying cash balance would have implications for the level of 
           government debt. Under Scenario, g 3 ross deb, mt easured by the face value of 
           Australian Government Securities (AGS) on issue ,would be lower, reflecting lower 
           government  borrowing associated with the strongeru dbget position. Public debt 
           interest payments would also be lower, further contributing to the improvement in the 
           underlying cash balance. 
           Scenario 4 assumes potential GDP grows at 2½ pe rcent, which is a ¼ of a percentage 
           point lower than the Budget projections. This is calculated off a potential productivity 
           assumption that is ¼ of a percentage point lower than the  1per.5 cent used in the 
           medium-term projections framework. This has broadly opposite effects on the 
           economy compared with Scenario 3. 
           The lower potential growth in Scenario 4 has a negative impact on the underlying cash 
           balance (Chart 12). Receipts are lower across the period and payments higher overall. 
           In this scenario, the underlying cash balance is0.5   percentage points of GDP lower 
           than baseline at the end of the medium term. Gross debt and public debt interest 
           payments would be higher than in the baseline scenario.

                             Output gap scenarios 
                             The assumption that the economy will absorb spare capacity over five years affects the 
                             economic and fiscal projections. In 201819 B-             udget Paper 1, Statement 8 Forecasting 
                             Performance and Scenario Analysis, the impact of shortening and lengthening this period 
                             was examined. The broad conclusions remain unchanged. 
                              
                             Scenario 5: Alternative yield assumption 
                             Over the forward estimates period, yields on Australian Government Securities (AGS) 
                             are assumed to remain fixed at the levels observed immediately prior to the Budget 
                             update, before converging to a long-run assumed yield curve over the medium term. 
                             The long-run curve is based on a 10-year AGS yield of 5 per cent. This is consistent 
                             with the 2017 Long-Term Cost Report released by the Australian Government Actuary. 
                             The observed yield curve converges to the long-run curve in the medium term. 
                             Scenario 5 examines the consequences of a 100 basis point steepening of the yield curve 
                             between the cash rate and the 10-year bond rate (Chart 13). Yields remain higher until 
                             the end of the forward estimates, after which yields converge to the assumed lon-grun 
                             yield curve, consistent with the baseline assumption.

                       Yields on AGS affect both government income and expenses. Yields affect the amount of 
                       public debt interest (PDI) the Government has to pay on its borrowings, but also have an 
                       impact on projections of the receipts the Government earns on its investments.  
                       As shown in Table 6 of Budget Statement 6: Debt Statement, Assets and Liabilities, the 
                       Government borrows a large proportion of its debt in medium and long-dated debt. 
                       Conversely, many government investments are held in sho-rtdated assets. As such, a 
                       steepening of the yield curve affects government debt more than assets. 
                       Compared with the Budget projections, a steeper-than-assumed yield curve results in a 
                       small deterioration to the underlying cash balance over the forward estimates, and a net 
                       deterioration in the projected underlying cash balance of around 0.1 percentage points of 
                       GDP by 2029-30 (Chart 14).

                             The increase in gross debt results in a similar increase in net deb t(Chart 15). However, 
                             this is offset over the forward estimates by lower market values ofGS A from higher 
                             yields. As a result, compared to baseline, net debt decreases by 1.3 percentage points of 
                             GDP in 2019-20, and remains 0.5 percentage points of GDP lower by 2022-23. Over the 
                             medium term, as the baseline yields converge to their longr-un rates, the impact of the 
                             yield shock is unwound. The combination of increased gross debt and unwinding the

                                  The forward estimates of revenue and expenses in t0h19e 2-20 Budget incorporate 
                                  assumptions and judgments based on the best information available at the time of 
                                  publication. A range of factors may influence the actual budget outcome in future 
                                  years. The disclosure of these factors in this Statement increases the transparency of the 
                                  fiscal projections. 
                                  Events that could affect fiscal outcomes include: 
                                  •    changes in economic and other parameters, particularly global economic 
                                       developments; 
                                  •    matters not included in the fiscal forecasts because of uncertainty abouirt  the
                                       timing, magnitude or likelihood; and 
                                  •    the realisation of contingent liabilities or assets. 
                                  RISKS TO THE BUDGET — OVERVIEW 
                                  The revenue and expense estimates and projections published in the 2019-20 Budget 
                                  Papers are based on a range of economic and other parameters. If the economic 
                                  outlook were to differ from that presented in the Budget, the revenue and expense 
                                  estimates and projections would also change. The sensitivity of budget estimates to 
                                  changes in economic assumptions is discussed in Statement 7: Forecasting Performance 
                                  and Scenario Analysis. 
                                  To the extent that unanticipated changes in economic conditions occur, their impact 
                                  will flow through to government expense and revenue forecasts. For example, over the 
                                  past year stronger than expected commodity prices have been reflected in stronger 
                                  forecasts for company tax revenue. 
                                  In addition, revenue forecasting relies on the observed historical relationships between 
                                  the economy, tax bases and tax revenues. Such relationships may shift as conditions 
                                  change  and present a further risk to the estimates. For example, private sector 
                                  company losses, including those resulting from larg-sce ale investments, have posed 
                                  particular challenges in estimating both the quantum and timing of loss utilisation. 
                                  Revenue forecasts also incorporate costings for new policies, which also typically have 
                                  a margin of uncertainty. 
                                  The Budget is subject to a number of contingent liabilities. A large number of these 
                                  contingent liabilities reflect indemnities, including those relating to the Department of 
                                  Defence, the Future Fund Management Agency and Future Fund Board of Guardians, 
                                  and the Reserve Bank of Australia. 
                                                                                              8-3 
                                Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
                                The Australian Government has also issued a number of guarantees, such as those 
                                relating to guarantee schemes for the banking and financial sector, payments by the 
                                Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and the superannuation liabilities of the 
                                Commonwealth Bank prior to its sale to the private sector. 
                                Other significant contingent liabilities relate to uncalled capital subscriptions and 
                                credit facilities to international financial institutions and legal cases concerning the 
                                Australian Government. The Government has robust and conservative strategies in 
                                place to reduce its potential exposure to these contingent liabilities. 
                                There have been several changes to both the quantifiable and unquantifiable risks since 
                                the 2018-19 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEF. GO) eneral revaluations of 
                                securities and deposits have led to certain risks such as the Guarantee of State and 
                                Territory Borrowings and the Financial Claims Scheme being modified. Several new 
                                risk items have also arisen since the MYEFO. 
                                Contingent liabilities, contingent assets and other fiscal risks with a possible impact on

                         FISCAL RISKS 
                         Fiscal risks comprise general developments or specific events that may affect the fiscal 
                         outlook. Some developments or events raise the possibility of a fiscal impact. In other 
                         cases, the likelihood of a fiscal impact may be reasonably certain, but will not be 
                         included in the forward estimates because the timing or magnitude is not known. 
                         There are measures which impact on the Budget aggregates that remain subject to the 
                         legislative process. If legislation is not passed by Parliament as proposed, this may 
                         affect the estimates and projections of the Budget. 
                         Specific fiscal risks to the Budget and forward estimates are detailed below. 
                         Agriculture and Water Resources 
                         Murray Darling Basin Reform — risk assignment 
                         The Australian Government has committed to bridge the gap between the Baseline 
                         Diversion Limit and the Sustainable Diversion Limits in the Basin Plan through water 
                         recovery by  30  June  2019. If water recovery is ifnfsicuient to bridge the gap, 
                         the Water Act 2007 provides a risk assignment framework whereby entitlement holders 
                         with reductions in water allocations, or changes in the reliability of water allocations, 
                         may be eligible for payment from the Commonwealth. 
                         The total cost (if any) of the operation of the risk assignment framework will depend 
                         on water recoveries, and the status of water resource plan accreditation. While any 
                         remaining gap at 30J une 2019 is expected to be sma,l tl he total cost is not able to be 
                         quantified, and remains a fiscal risk, until the Sustainable Diversion Limits in the 
                         Basin Plan come into effect on 1 July 2019. 
                         Defence 
                         Major operations of the Australian Defence Force in 2019-20 
                         The  2019-20  estimates for the Department of Defence include the cost of major 
                         operations of the Australian Defence Force in 201920-  in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and 
                         the broader Middle Eas regt  ion, as well as the protection of Australia’s borders and 
                         offshore maritime interests. Funding for major Defence operations is considered and 
                         provisioned on a yea-rby-year basis.  The  forward estimates at the 201920 -Budget 
                         include additional funding for these major operations in the 201-20 y9    ear but do not 
                         provide for further extensions. The Department of Defence will likely have additional 
                         funding requirements for major operations beyond 30 June 2020. 
                                                                   8-10 
                                                                               Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
                       Education and Training 
                       Recovery of inappropriately claimed VET FEE-HELP payments from VET 
                       providers, a remedy for students and interim tuition assurance arrangements 
                       The Australian Government is undertaking compliance action, including court action, 
                       to recover VET FEEH-ELP payments from VET providers where loans were issued 
                       inappropriately to students by providers. The Government has legited asla   remedy, 
                       which commenced 1 January 2019, for VET FEEHE– LP students who incurred debts 
                       under the VET FEEH-ELP loan scheme following inappropriate conduct by VET 
                       providers. The Government will undertake recovery activities against VET providers 
                       in cases where the student was ineligible for a VET FEE-HELP loan. 
                       There are potential financial risks to the Commonwealth in the event that it is unable 
                       to recover payments from VET providers where they have closed or entered into 
                       administration or liquidation. 
                       There is also a financial risk to the Commonwealth that it will be unable to recover the 
                       cost of remitting student debts following VET provider closures, either while it 
                       administers interim tuition assurance arrangements or from tuition assurance 
                       operators for provider closures which occurred prior to 1 January 2018. 
                       The financial risk to the Commonwealth is currently unquantifiable as it depends on 
                       the receipt and assessment of applications from students, as well as outcomes from the 
                       Government’s investigations into VET providers’ conduct.

                       Snowy Hydro Limited — Snowy 2.0 
                       The Australian Government has committed up to $1.38 billion in additional equity to 
                       Snowy Hydro Limited to support the delivery of the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project, 
                       subject to Snowy Hydro achieving financial close and issuing the Notice to Proceed for 
                       the main project works. Snowy 2.0 will improve the security and reliability of the 
                       National Electricity Market by providing reliable, dispatchable power and large-scale 
                       energy storage. Project costs will not be finalised until all planning and environmental 
                       approvals are completed. Project risks include construction delays, cost pressures, and 
                       cash flow forecasts. These pressures are being mitigated through close management of 
                       the delivery program and engagement with key stakeholders.

                       Export Finance and Insurance Corporation — National Interest Account 
                       The Government will establish an Australian Infrastructure Finance Facility for the 
                       Pacific (AIFFP) from 1 July 2019, which will provide up t o$1.5 billion in longt-erm 
                       loans to support high priority infrastructure development in Pacific countries and 
                       Timor-Leste. The facility will have no financial implications until drawn on. 
                                                               8-11 
                 Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
                 The Government has established a  Defence Export Facility. The Facility has a 
                 maximum aggregate exposure of US$3.0 billion. The Facility has no financial 
                 implications until drawn on. As at 25 February 2019, three loans under the Facility had 
                 been agreed for a total maximum value of $213 million. These are reflected in the 
                 Budget estimates.

                 Risks to External Revenue 
                 Estimates for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation 
                 (CSIRO) include revenue from the non-government sector for research undertaken as 
                 part of CSIRO’s role within the national innovation system. Changes to the economic 
                 climate, and the potential for cyb-aetrtacks to compromise CSIRO research, could 
                 reduce the value of scientific research and Intellectual Property and lead to lower 
                 levels of external revenue.

                 Inland Rail — Delivery 
                 The Australian Government has committed to deliver the Inland Rail project through 
                 the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) to provide a direct, high-performance 
                 freight rail corridor between Melbourne and Brisbane, as well as a new freight corridor 
                 between Brisbane and Perth (via Parkes). 
                 The ARTC will deliver Inland Rail using up to a $9 billion equity investment from the 
                 Commonwealth. A Public Private Partnersh wipill be established to design, build, 
                 finance and maintain the complex Toowoomba to Kagaru (Brisbane) section of the 
                 project, including major tunnelling works. 
                 Project costs will not be finalised untrefil erence design, planning, environmental 
                 approvals,  and procurements are completed. Project risks include securing 
                 jurisdictional support, construction delays, cost pressures, and revenues realised. 
                 These pressures are being mitigated through close management of the delivery 
                 program and engagement with key stakeholders and jurisdictions.

           Departure of the ACT Government from the Comcare workers’ compensation 
           scheme 
           On 1 March 2019 the ACT Government departed the Comcare premium scheme 
           following the decision by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to 
           grant the ACT Government a licence to self-insure its workers’ compensation liabilities 
           under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. 
           The licence conditions transfer all workers’ compensation liabilities for 
           ACT Government employees, with a date of injury on or after 1 July 1989, from the 
           Commonwealth to the ACT Government. Fund iwngill be transferred to the 
           ACT Government for outstanding costs relating to claims with a date of injury before 
           1 March 2019 pending an exit valuation of claims liabilities. The payment will have an 
           impact on the underlying cash balance. 
           The Commonwealth has made an initial payment of $76.2 million in 201819,-  which 
           has been included in the estimates, but the total costs of these arrangements are yet to 
           be determined. 
           CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND ASSETS 
           Contingent liabilities and contingent assets of the Australian Government are listed 
           below by portfolio. These contingent liabilities and assets are a specific category of 
           fiscal risks. Broadly, they represent possiostbsle or c  gains to the 
           Australian Government arising from past events or decisions which will be confirmed 
           or otherwise by the outcome of future events that are noitt whin the Government’s 
           control. 
           Contingencies reported in this Statement include loan guarantees, noloan-n 
           guarantees, warranties, indemnities, uncalled capital and letters of comfort, together 
           with those contingencies considered remote. These contingencies are in addition to the 
           liabilities and assets already recognised in the consolidated financial statements of the 
           Australian Government general government sector in Statement 9. 
           In general, information on contingent liabilities and assets is based on information 
           provided by Australian Government departments andn etities and is current to 
           25 February 2019. In some cases, other dates are used and those are noted in the 
           relevant section.

                                  The Australian Government has entered into anu Eity Fq unding Agreement with 
                                  NBN Co Limited (NBN Co). Although this agreement will end in 2019, the 
                                  Commonwealth retains obligations to meet NBN Co’s costs arising from a termination 
                                  of the roll-out. As at 31 January 2019, NBN Co’s termination liabilities were estimated 
                                  at $19.8 billion. 
                                  Optus Financial Guarantee 
                                  The Australian Government has provided a guarantee in respect of NBN Co’s financial 
                                  obligations to Optus Networks Pty Ltd, Optus Internet Pty Limited, OVpisituos n 
                                  Media Pty Limited and SingTel Optus Pty Ltd (collectively, Optus) under the 
                                  Optus HFC Subscriber Agreement  (the Agreement).  An amended version of the 
                                  Agreement came into effect on 22 January 2019. The Guarantee continues to apply to 
                                  that Agreement. The Agreement extends fother   period of the National Broadband 
                                  Network roll-out in Optus Hybrid Fibre Coaxial areas. The Australian Government is 
                                  only liable in the event NBN Co does not pay an amount when due under the 
                                  Optus Agreement. As at 31 January 2019, NBN Co had generated liabilitiesc overed by 
                                  the Optus Agreement which are estimated at an amount less than $160.0 million. There 
                                  is a low risk that a claim would be made under the Guarantee. The Guarantee will 
                                  terminate in 2021. 
                                  Telstra Financial Guarantee 
                                  The Australian Government has provided to Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra) a 
                                  guarantee in respect of NBN Co financial obligations under the Definitive Agreements. 
                                  The Agreements were amended on 14 December 2014. The Guarantee was not 
                                  amended at that time and it continue sin force in accordance with its terms in respect 
                                  of the amended Definitive Agreements. The liabilities under the Definitive Agreements 
                                  between Telstra and NBN Co arise progressively during the roloul- t of the National 
                                  Broadband Network as Telstra’s infrastructure is accessed and Telstra’s customers are 
                                  disconnected from its copper and Hybrid Fibre Coaxial cable networks. The Australian 
                                  Government is only liable in the event NBN Co does not pay an amount when due 
                                  under the Definitive Agreements. As at 31 January 2019, NBCo haN d generated 
                                  liabilities covered by the Guarantee estimated a8.t $8  billion. The Guarantee will 
                                  terminate when NBN Co achieves specified credit ratings for a period of two 
                                  continuous years and either: 
                                  •    the company is capitalised by the Commonwealth to the agreed amount; or 
                                  •    the Minister for Communications declares, under the National Broadband Network 
                                       Companies Act 2011, that, in his or her opinion, the National Broadband Network

           Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund 
           In February 2016, the Commonwealth agreed to assume onteh-ird of the default risk 
           associated with a $320 million New South WalesNS (W)  Government loan to the 
           Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund (AICF), contingent on all states and territories 
           agreeing to assume the remaining default risk. States and territories agreed to assume 
           the remaining default risk in the period following the publication of the 
           2016-17 Budget. 
           The AICF provides compensation to Australian asbestos disease related claims against 
           former subsidiaries of the James Hardie Group, and is funded on an ongoing basis 
           through contributions from the James Hardie Group. NSW provided a $320 million 
           loan facility in 2010 to enable AICF to continue to pay compensation as lump sums, 
           rather than on an instalment basis.

           state and territory will receive funding that is at least the cumulative better of the 
           current distribution system or the updated distribution system over that period. 
           This will be achieved by providing additional financial assistance to a state or territory 
           for a payment year if, for a particular payment year occurring during the period 
           2021-22 to 2026-27 (inclusive), a state’s or a territory’s cumulative grant entitlements 
           under the updated distribution system, calculated from the beginning of the transition 
           period, are less than the cumulative entitlements they would have received underhe t 
           current distribution system. 
           There is currently no expected liability under the guarantee.

           Financial Claims Scheme 
           The Financial Claims Scheme provides depositors of authorised- dtakinepgo sit
           institutions (ADIs) and claimants of general insurers with timely access to their funds 
           in the event of a financial institution failure. 
           Under the Banking Act 1959 t,he scheme provides a mechanism for making payments 
           to depositors under the Government’s guarantee of deposits in ADIs. Payments are 
           capped at $250,000 per account holder per ADI. As at 31 Dec 2018,ember deposits 
           eligible for coverage underth e Financial Claims Scheme were estimated to be 
           $920 billion, compared to an estimated $895 billion as at 30 June 2018, reflecting overall 
           deposit growth in the financial system. 
           Under the Insurance Act 1973, the scheme provides a mechanism for making payments 
           to eligible beneficiaries with a valid claim against a failed general insurer. It is not 
           possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be required in 
           relation to general insurance claims. 
           In the very unlikely event of an ADI or general insurer failure, any payments made 
           under the Financial Claims Scheme would be recovered through the liquidation of the 
           failed institution. If there was a shortfall in the amount recovered through the 
           liquidation of the failed institution, a levy could be applied to the relevant industry to 
           recover the difference between the amount expended and the amount recovered in the 
           liquidation. 
           The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is responsible for 
           administration of the Financial Claims Scheme. Under the Financial Claims Scheme, 
           any payments to account holders with eligible protected accounts or eligible claimants 
           would be made from APRA’s Financial Claims Scheme Special Account. Under the 
           legislation, upon activation, up to $20 billion per institution would be available to meet 
           Financial Claims Scheme payments and up to $100 million for administration costs 
           per institution. 
           Guarantee for the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation 
           The Australian Government guarantees hte due payment of money payable by the 
           National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) to anybody other 
           than the Government. 
           The NHFIC Board must not allow NHFIC to enter into a transaction that would result 
           in the total guaranteed liabilities of the NHFIC ,and any outstanding amount which 
           NHFIC has borrowed from the Government, to exceed $2 billion unless approved by 
           the Government.

           Guarantee of state and territory borrowing 
           The Australian Government announced on 25 March 2009 that a voluntary, temporary 
           guarantee would be put in place over state and territory borrowing. The Guarantee of 
           state and territory borrowing commenced on 24 July 2009 and closed on 
           31 December 2010. New South Wales and Queensland were the only states who chose 
           to participate in the Guarantee. 
           Securities covered by the Guarantee will continue to be guaranteed until these 
           securities either mature or are bought back and extinguished by the issuer. 
           The expected liability under the Guarantee is remote and unquantifiable. Australian 
           Government expenditure would arise under the Guarantee ony l in the unlikely event 
           that a state failed to meet its obligations with respect to a commitment that was subject 
           to the Guarantee and the Guarantee was called upon. In such a case, the Government 
           would likely be able to recover any such expenditurehr tough a claim on the relevant 
           state at a future date. The impact on the Government’s budget would depend upon the 
           extent of the default and the state’s ability to meet the Government’s claim. 
           As at 31 January 2019, the face value of state and territory borrowings covered by the 
           Guarantee was $3.5 billion, down from $3.6 billion at 30 September 2018. 
           Guarantees under the 
                      Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995 
           Under the terms of the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 199,5 the Australian Government 
           has guaranteed various superannuation and other liabilities: $141.millio9n  is 
           attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as at 
           31 December 2018; and $4.4 billion is attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth 
           Bank Officers’ Superannuation Corporation, as at 31 December 2018. 
           Reserve Bank of Australia — Guarantee 
           The Australian Government guarantees the liabilities of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 
           measured as the Bank’s total liabilities excluding cap  resital,erves, and Australian 
           Government deposits. The major component of the Bank’s liabilities is Australian 
           banknotes on issue. Banknotes on issue amount to $80.2 billion as at 20 February 2019, 
           and the total Guarantee is $114.2 billion.

           Agriculture and Water Resources 
           Commonwealth liabilities in respect of matching payments to industries for 
           research and development contributions 
           Under several Acts, the Commonwealth provides matching contributions to encourage 
           expenditure on research and development (R&D) and to increase the competitiveness 
           and sustainability of industries within Australia. Matching contributions on eligible 
           R&D are subject to an annual limit that is calculated based on the determined gross 
           value of production (GVP cap) for the industries. There will be an R&D excess, which 
           can be claimable in future years, where the cumulative R&D expenditure is more than 
           the GVP cap. The Commonwealth’s future liability in respect of the matching 
           contributions is contingent on the GVP cap and is therefore unquantifiable. 
           Emergency pest and disease response arrangements 
           National emergency response arrangements for animal, plant and environmental pest 
           and disease incursions are largely funded through cost sharing agreenmtse between 
           Australian governments and, where relevant, agricultural industry bodies. Under the 
           terms of the emergency response agreements, the Australian Government is typically 
           liable for 50 per cent of the total government funding for a nationally agreed response 
           to a disease or pest incursion. Funding is provided in the forward estimates for the 
           Australian Government’s contribution under the emergency response agreemen ts,
           which is paid to the relevant state or territory government. This funding is unlikely to 
           be sufficient to meet the costs of a large-scale pest or disease incursion or additional 
           and multiple responses (noting there are currently 14 national co-ssthared emergency 
           responses and,  until 202627–, more than half of this funding is allocated to an 
           eradication program for red imported fire ants in Queensland). All Australian 
           governments have agreed to consider new response deeds for aquatic emergency 
           animal diseases and exotic production weeds. Should these be agreed, potential 
           liabilities for the Australian Government will be increased. 
           The Australian Government may provide financial assistance to an industry party by 
           funding its share of an emergency response. These contributions are recovered from 
           the industry over a period of up to 10 years, usually through an emergency response 
           levy. The Australian Government may also contribute bilaterally in situations where 
           an incursion is not covered by a cost-sharing agreement or where the affected industry 
           body/bodies are not party to an emergency response agreement, depending on the 
           circumstances of the incursion.

                          Australian Government’s liability cannot be quantified owing to uncertainty about the 
                          number and effect of compensable acts and the value of Native Title affected by 
                          those acts.

                          The Australian Government has provided Directors of NBN Co with an indemnity 
                          against liability should the Government fail to meet its funding obligations to NBN Co. 
                          The liabilities covered by this indemnity would be no greater than those covered by

           Snowy Hydro Limited — water releases 
           On 29 June 2018, Snowy Hydro Limited became a wholly Commonwealth owned 
           company following the Commonwealth’s acquisition of the New South Wales (NSW) 
           and Victorian Governments’ shares. At the time of corporatisatin oof Snowy Hydro 
           Limited, on 28 June 2002, the Australian, NSW and Victorian Governments, as the then 
           owners, indemnified the company for liabilities arising from water releases in the 
           Snowy River below Jindabyne Dam, where these releases are in accordance with the 
           Snowy Water Licence and related regulatory arrangements agreed between the 
           three governments, including the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed 
           (SWIOID) 2002. The indemnity applies to liabilities for which a claim is notified within 
           20 years from 28 June 2002. 
           As the sole owner, the Commonwealth is now wholly liable for the indemnity. 
           However, NSW must pay 100 per cent of the amount claimable where the liability is a 
           result of the Snowy Water Licence being inconsistent with the SWIOID or with a 
           direction from NSW that is inconsistent with principles for managing water releases 
           from Jindabyne Dam, as agreed by the Australian, NSW and Victorian governments. 
           Liability for costs incurred in a national liquid fuel emergency 
           The Australian Government has responsibility for the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act 1984 
           (the Act). In addition, the Australian Government and state and territory governments 
           have entered into an inter-governmental agreement in relation to a national liquid fuel 
           emergency (IGA 2006). Under the IGA, the Australian Government agrees to consult 
           IGA parties on a likely shortage and, if necessary after those consultations, to advise 
           the Governor General to declare a national emergency under the Act. 
           The IGA also contains three areas where the Australian Government may incur 
           expenses in the unlikely event of a national liquid fuel emergency. These relate to the 
           direct costs of managing a liquid fuel emergency and include the possibility of the 
           Australian Government reimbursing the state aned trritory governments for costs 
           arising from their responses, and potential compensation for industry arising from 
           Australian Government directions under the Act.

           ASC provided an indemnity in favour of ASC Shipbuilding prior to ASC Shipbuilding

                             On 4 September 2008,50 a 1-year lease for Googong Dam was signed between the 
                             Australian Government and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government. The 
                             Australian Government is liable to pay just terms compensation if the terms of the 
                             lease are breached by introducing new legislation or changing tCahneb erra Water 
                             Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 in a way that impacts on the rights of the ACT. The 
                             lease includes a requirement for the Australian Government to undertake rectification 
                             of easements or any defects in title in relation to Googong Dam, and remediation of 
                             any contamination it may have caused to the site. It also gives an indemnity in relation 
                             to acts or omissions by the Australian Government. 
                             Indemnities for the Reserve Bank of Australia and private sector banks 
                             In accordance with Government entities’ contracts for transactional banking services, 
                             the Australian Government has indemnified the Reserve Bank of Australia and 
                             contracted private sector banks against loss and damage arising from error or fraud by 
                             the entity, or transactions made by the bank with the authority of the entity. 
                             Indemnities relating to other former asset sales, privatisations and information 
                             technology outsourcing projects 
                             Ongoing indemnities have been given in respect of a range of asset sales, privatisations 
                             and information technology (IT) outsourcing projects that have been conducted by the 
                             Department of Finance (Finance), and the former Office of Asset Sales and Commercial 
                             Support and its predecessors. The probability of an action being made under one of 
                             these indemnities diminishes over time. Details of indemnities in respect of the other 
                             asset sales and privatisations have been provided in preuvsio Budget and MYEFO 
                             papers, and previous annual reports of Finance and the Office of Asset Sales and 
                             Commercial Support. 
                             Indemnities are listed below. Apart from instances noted elsewhere, Finance does not 
                             currently expect any other action to be taken in respect of these indemnities.

                               from approximately 90 reported at the 2-01918  Budget  due to the ongoing 
                               implementation of the measure Smaller Government — Surplus Commonwealth Properties

                               identified, which are currently the subject of further investigation. Except fheo r t
                               properties at Lucas Heights, New South Wales and Cox Peninsula, Northern Territory, 
                               none of the remaining properties with potential remediation issues has had a provision 
                               recognised, as neither the conditions for legal nor constructive obligations have been 
                               met, nor is a reliable estimate of the obligation currently possible.

                               liabilities are subject to large potential revisions as the ultimate outcome of claims is 
                               subject to events that have not yet occurred. 
                               Finance takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information 
                               regarding  its claims exposures, with estimates and judgements regularly updated 
                               based on historical experience and other factors.

                        The Accommodation Payment Guarantee Scheme (the Guarantee Scheme) guarantees 
                        the repayment of aged care residents’ refundable accommodation payments (including 
                        refundable deposits and accommodation bonds) if the approved provider becomes 
                        insolvent or bankrupt and defaults on its refund obligations. In return for the payment, 
                        the rights that the resident had to recover the amount from their approved provider 
                        are transferred to the Australian Government so it can pursue the approved provider 
                        for the funds. In cases where the funds are unable to be recovered, the Australian 
                        Government may levy all approved providers holding bonds, entry contributions and 
                        refundable accommodation deposits to meet any shortfall.

                        the principal sites, and only within a certain scope. All indemnities are also subject to

                        other available mitigation or cover is not available. Under certain conditions, the

                        claim costs, the Jurisdictional Blood Committee will consider a report provided by the 
                        National Funds Manager to determine the lev  aelddi otifonal funds required.

                       Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas Payment 
                       The  Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) 
                       Act 2012 inserted Part 2.24AA into the Social Security Act 1991 to create a scheme for 
                       providing financial assistance to Australian residents who are victims of an overseas 
                       terrorist act that has been declared by the Prime Minister. The scheme commenced on 
                       22 January 2013. Undert he scheme, Australian residents harmed (primary victims) or 
                       whose close family members die as a direct result of a declared terrorist act 
                       (secondary victims) are eligible to claim one-off payments of up to $75,000. As acts of 
                       terrorism are unpredictable,a nd the declaration of overseas terrorists acts 
                       discretionary, the cost of the scheme is unquantifiable. 
                       Disaster recovery 
                       The Australian Government provides funding to states and territories through the 
                       Australian Government Cost Sharing Arrangements (tNuaral Disaster Relief and 
                       Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) and the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements 
                       (DRFA) 2018) to assist with natural disar relste    ief and recovery costs. Atate o s r 
                       territory may claim NDRRA/DRFA funding if a natural disaster occurs and state or 
                       territory relief and recovery expenditure for that event meets the requirements set out 
                       in the arrangements. For major disasters, the Australian Government may approve 
                       payments to individuals under the Social Security Act 1991. These include the Disaster 
                       Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery Allowance. As disasters and their impacts 
                       are unpredictable, the cost relating to these payments from future disasters is 
                       unquantifiable and therefore not included in the forward estimates. 
                       The current forward estimates for the NDRRA/ DRFA include preliminary estimates 
                       for past events, based on the best information available at the time of preparation. 
                       Preliminary estimates of the cost of a disaster and the timing of expenditure are subject 
                       to change. The total cost of relief and recovery from these past events may not be 
                       completely realised for some yea rEs.stimates of the Commonwealth’s share of the 
                       costs of restoration or replacement of essential public assets stemming from the recent 
                       North Queensland flood disaster were not available at the time of preparation and 
                       have not been included in the Budget estimates. 
                       In this Budget the Government has also established an Emergency Response Fund 
                       (ERF) which will provide a sustainable source of additional funding for recovery from 
                       natural disasters. Consistent with the treatment of NDRRA and DRFA, and reflecting 
                       the unpredictability of disasters and their impacts, the cost of any payments from the 
                       ERF are unquantifiable and not reflected in Budget estimates. Disbursements from the 
                       ERF will be capped at $150 million annually over the 201-290 to 2023-24 period and 
                       from 2023-24 will be restricted to the value of average annual net earnings of the fund 
                       over the preceding five years.

                        asbestos in a number of buildings and potentially in soil surrounding these buildings. 
                        Although there  is potential for claims being made in relation to asbestos related 
                        diseases, the potential costs have not been assessed and are unquantifiable

                        place until April 2026.

                        The Australian and Western Australian  (WAGov)  ernments have provided an 
                        indemnity to the Gorgon Joint Venture Partners (GJV) against independent third-party 
                        claims (relating to stored carbon dioxide) under common law following closure of the 
                        carbon dioxide sequestration project. The claims are subject to conditions equivalent to 
                        those set out in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. 
                        The WA Government has indemnified the GJV, and the Australian Government has 
                        indemnified the WA Government for 80 per cent of any amount determined to be 
                        payable under that indemnity.

                        The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)  has
                        made a financial provision for the estimated costs in restoring and decontaminating 
                        land where a legal or constructive obligation has arisen. For cases where there is no 
                        legal or constructive obligation, the potential costs have not been assessed and are 
                        unquantifiable contingencies.

                       services in the JBT. The indemnity covers the same period of time for which NSW RFS 
                       is engaged to provide the fire management services. The likelihood of an event 
                       occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian Government is assessed as 
                       remote. The risk of a liability is mitigated through a range of risk management 
                       measures, including NSW RFS staff training and professional qualifications. 
                       Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited — Board Members’ Indemnity 
                       The Australian Government has provided certain indemnities for the Directors and 
                       Officers of the Moorebank Intermodal Company Limited to protect them against civil 
                       claims relating to their employment and conduct. The indemnities apply to the period 
                       of appointment as Directors or Officers of the company. Until the indemnity 
                       agreements are varied or brought to an end, they will remain as contingent and 
                       unquantifiable liabilities. 
                       Moorebank Intermodal Project — Georges River rail crossing 
                       The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to cover costs and liabilities 
                       that may be incurred by the tSate of New South Wales arising under the Native Title 
                       Act 1993 (Cth) associated with the construction of a rail bridge over the George sRiver 
                       to the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal. The likelihood of costs being incurred is 
                       considered remote and potential costs are unquantifiable.

                       the Cocos (Keeling) Islands) btyhe   Western Australian (WA) Government under 
                       Service Delivery Arrangements (SDAs) agreed with the Australian Government. There 
                       are 45 SDAs in place with WA Government agencies fors ervices to the Indian Ocean 
                       Territories. 
                       The Australian Government has provided certain indemnities for the 
                       WA Government, their respective officers, agents, contractors and employees against 
                       civil claims relating to their employment and conduct as officers.

           Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
           From 1 July 2016, the New South Wales (NSW) Government has provided a range of 
           services to the Norfolk Island community through a Heads of Agreement. The NSW 
           Government also provides rural fire services to the Jervis Bay Territory under a Service 
           Delivery Agreement. The Australian Government provides certain indemnities for the 
           State of NSW and NSW authorities and officials in respect of the delivery of services to 
           Norfolk Island and the Jervis Bay Territory. 
           The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) provides a number of services to the Jervis Bay 
           Territory under Memorandums of Understanding. The Australian Government has 
           provided certain indemnities for the ACT Government authorities and officials in 
           respect of the delivery of services to the Jervis Bay Territory. 
           The likelihood of an event occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian 
           Government has been assessed as remote and the risks are currently mitigated through 
           the training and professional qualifications of the staff of these agencies. 
           Australian Maritime Safety Authority incident costs 
           In the normal course of operations, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) 
           is responsible for the provision of funds necessary to meet the clea-upn  costs arising 
           from ship-sourced marine pollution and, in all circumstances, is responsible for 
           making appropriate efforts to recover the costs of any such incidents. The Australian 
           Government meets costs that cannot be recovered from such incidents. It is not 
           possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be required in 
           relation to these incident costs. AMSA has established a pollution response financial 
           capability of  $50 million,  backed  by  liquid investment fundst, o provide funding 
           should the overall clean-up costs exceed the liability limit of the ship-owner. 
           Aviation rescue and firefighting potential per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances 
           contamination 
           Airservices Australia (Airservices) has identified a number of sites in Australia 
           potentially contaminated with per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) previously 
           contained in firefighting foams. 
           The identified contaminants do not naturally break down in the environment. 
           According to the Environmental Health Standing Committee (enHealth), a joint 
           Commonwealth-state standing committee of the Australian Health Protection 
           Principal Committee (AHPPC), which reports to the Australian Health Ministers 
           Advisory Council (AHMAC), there is currently no consistent evidence that exposure to 
           PFAS causes adverse human health effects. Airservices continues to implement its 
           national PFAS management program which included PFAS investigations at 20 airport 
           sites. Potential long-term management option costs cannot be quantified at this time. 
           Up to 36 airports sites are potentially contaminated with PFAS (19 federally leased 
           airports and 17 regional airports). 
                              8-34 
                                     Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
           For federally leased airports, Airport Lessee Companies are responsible for 
           environmental management of their airport sites. Airport leases indemnify the 
           Commonwealth in relation to damages or injury to the environment. Liability has not 
           yet been established for costs arising from PFAS contamination. 
           Currently, there are three class actions against the Commonwealth seeking damages 
           over the use of historical PFA-Scontaining firefighting foam by the Department of 
           Defence at Williamtown, Oakey and Katherine (Tindal), with potential implications for 
           the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities, and Airservices. 
           Brisbane Airport Corporation has also commenced legal proceedings in the 
           Queensland Supreme Court against Airservices in relation to legacy PFAS 
           contamination from Airservices’ firefighting activities at the airport.

           Terrorism insurance — commercial cover 
           The Terrorism Insurance Act 2003 established a scheme for terrorism insurance covering 
           damage to commercial property, including associated business interruption and public 
           liability (extended in 2017 to mix-eudse and highv-alue residential buildings). The 
           Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) uses reinsurance premiums paid by 
           insurers to meet its administrative expenses, to maintain a pool of funds and to 
           purchase reinsurance to help meet future claims. The AGuovstrearlnmeian  nt 
           guarantees to pay any liabilities of the ARPC, but the responsible Minister 
           (or delegate) must declare a reduced payout rate to insured entities if the 
           Government’s liability would otherwise exceed $10 billion.

           Defence 
           Non-remote contingent assets 
           As at 30 June 2018, the Depearnttm of Defence had five instances of unquantifiable

                         Defence 
                         Claims against the Department of Defence 
                         The Department of Defence (Defence) has six instances of n-oremn ote, quantifiable 
                         contingent liabilities in respect of claims on Defence valued at $53.8 million. The 
                         estimated figure is determined by conducting an objective analysis of the probable 
                         amount payable for all matters managed by firms engaged by Defence through the 
                         Attorney-General’s Legal Services Multi-Use List and those being handled in-house by 
                         Defence Legal Division. However, the exact amount payable under those claims is 
                         uncertain. Defence is defending the claims or is trying to resolve them by recourse to 
                         alternative dispute resolution measures.

                         The Australian Government has provided indemnities to directors and company 
                         officers of the former Low Carbon Australia Limited (LCAL). A total of 
                         seven indemnity deeds were executed in 2014. Each indemnity covers liability incurred 
                         by a director or officer arising from the implementation of the merger of LCAL with 
                         the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. An aggregate cap of $100 million to cover all 
                         claims has been established, and the indemniesit will operate for seven years from 
                         execution (to 2020).

                         Refunds are only allowed during the ‘allowable refund period’. This period stasrt the 
                         day after the liable entity lodges its large-scale generation shortfall statement for the 
                         year following the year the shortfall charge was paid and ends three years after the 
                         charge was paid.

                     any time become payable by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) to 
                     anybody other than the Government. The Government also has in place a $200 million 
                     callable capital facility available to EFIC on request to cover liabilities, losses and 
                     claims. The Government has agreed (but not yet legislated) to increase EFIC’s callable 
                     capital by $.01  billion to $1.2 billion and grant it a new overseas infrastructure 
                     financing power. As at 31 January 2019, the Government’s total contingent liability 
                     was $3.4 billion. The $34 . billion contingent liability comprises EFIC’s liabilities to 
                     third parties ($2.7  billion) and EFIC’s overseas investment insurance, contracts of 
                     insurance and guarantees ($0.7 billion). Of the total contingent liability, $3.b0 illion 
                     relates to EFIC’s Commercial Account and $0.4b illion relates to the National Interest 
                     Account.

                     despite the decision of the Victorian Government not to proceed with the project. 
                     To this end, the Australian Government will provide $3 billion to  the first
                     Victorian Government willing to build the East West Link and is therefore recording 
                     this commitment as a contingent liability in the Budget.

                      Leases for public housing in remote Northern Territory 
                      The Commonwealth has entered into lon-tegrm leases for public housing lots in 
                      remote Northern Territory communities foar p    eriod of 4–909 years. Under these 
                      leases, the Commonwealth enters into subleases with a third-party housing provider to 
                      deliver property and tenancy management on its behalf, or delivers these 
                      responsibilities itself. The Northern Territory Government currently has s-hortermt  
                      subleases for all communities where Commonwealth lontermg-  leases are in place. 
                      Should these arrangements not continue, the Commonwealth will become responsible 
                      for delivering landlord duties under the leases.

                      Australian Taxation Office — tax disputes 
                      At any point in time the Australian Taxation Office is involved in a range of dispute 
                      resolution processes, including litigation, relating to tax disputes. 
                      Details of the outcome of dispute resolution processes are uncertain until a court ruling 
                      is made and/or an agreement is reached with the taxpayer. As a result, in most cases it 
                      is not possible to estimate with any reliability the likely financial impact of current 
                      disputes. The estimated aggregate value of tax in dispute aat s 31 January 2019, for 
                      which a provision has not been made, is $5.6 billion. 
                      Outcomes of dispute resolution processes are included in the Commissioner of 
                      Taxation’s Annual Report each year. This may include disputes resolved through 
                      objections, settlements and court and tribunal decisions. It may also include amounts 
                      owed by taxpayers that are subject to dispute but not finalised.

                        The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the 
                        International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) since 1947. In 2018, the 
                        Australian Government agreed to participate in a capital increase package which will 
                        increase the uncalled capital subscription by US$0.8 billiomante (d vestialue 
                        A$1.1 billion as at 25 February 2019). Subject to enabling legislation being passed by 
                        Parliament, Australia’s uncalled capital subscription to the IBRD totals US$4.4 billion 
                        (estimated value A$6.1 billion as at 25 February 2019). 
                        The Australian Government has also held an uncalled capital subscription in the 
                        European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) since 1991. Australia’s 
                        uncalled capital subscription to the EBRD totals EUR237.5 million (estimated value 
                        A$377.0 million as at 25 February 2019). 
                        The Australian Government has further held an uncalled capital subscription in the 
                        Asian Development Bank (ADB) since 1966. Australia’s uncalled capital subscription to

                        Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of US$26.5 million (estimated value 
                        A$37.0 million as at 25 February 2019).

                        25 December 2015. The Australian Government has subscribed to shares in the AIIB, 
                        which includes an uncalled capital subscription. Australia’s uncalled capital 
                        subscription to the AIIB totals US$3.0 billion (estimated value A1  b$illio4.  n as at 
                        25 February 2019). 
                        None of these international financial institutions has ever drawn on Australia’s

                        International Monetary Fund 
                        Australia has made a line of credit available to the International Monetary Fund (MI F) 
                        under its New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) since 1998. This is a contingent loan to 
                        help ensure that the IMF has the resources available to maintain stability in the global 
                        economy. The value of Australia’s NAB credit arrangement now stands at 
                        Special Drawing Rights (SDR, the IMF’s unit of account) SDR2.2 billion (estimated 
                        value A$4.3 billion at 25 February 2019). On 4 November 2016, the IMF Executive 
                        Board agreed to renew the NAB for an add-yiteaior pnal fieriod tve                       o

           Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
           In addition, Asturalia has made available a SDR4.61 billion (approximately 
           A$9.0 billion at 25 February 2019) contingent bilateral loan to the IMF. This contingent 
           loan is on terms consistent with separate bilateral loan and note purchase agreements 
           between the IMF and other contributing countries. It will be drawn upon by the IMF 
           only if needed to supplement the IMF’s quota and NAB resources and any loans 
           would be repaid in full with interest. The Treasurer agreed to renew Australia’s loan 
           agreement with the IMF on 19 Dceember 2016. The renewed agreement extends 
           Australia’s existing funding commitment to December 2019, with the possibility of an 
           additional one-year extension with Australia’s consent. 
           GOVERNMENT LOANS 
           Loans are recorded as financial assets and accordingly the amounts advanced and 
           repaid do not normally affect the budget aggregates of fiscal balance and underlying 
           cash balance. Loans that are concessional (lower than market interest rate) or are 
           agreed to be written off may result in an impact on fncies ical bn saomlae 
           circumstances. 
           The Government makes loans for policy purposes. All loans contain some element of 
           credit risk that they will not be repaid in full, although in many cases this risk is small.

                      Higher Education Loan Program 
                      The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) is an incom-ceontingent loan program 
                      that assists eligible tertiary education students with the cost of their fees. As at 
                      30 June 2019, the fair value of debt outstanding is estimated to be $46.1 billion. The fair 
                      value takes into account the concessionality of HELP loans and makes an allowance for 
                      debt not expected to be repaid. 
                      Debts are indexed annually by the Consumer Price Index. The repayment term 
                      depends on individual circumsta,nc  incesluding the amount borrowed and each 
                      debtor’s income. There were 2,872,603 HELP debtors as at 30 June 2018. The repayment 
                      term of a HELP debt can only be determined for people who have fully repaid their 
                      debt. As at the end of June 2081, the average time taken to repay HELP debts was 
                      9.1 years. 
                      HELP comprises a number of programs, including the VET Student Loans program, 
                      which replaced VET FEE-HELP from 1 January 2017. 
                      NBN Co Loan 
                      In December 2016, the Austraan Gli   overnment provided a loan to NBN Co on 
                      commercial terms of up to $19.5 billion for the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2021, 
                      with drawings available on a monthly basis. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 
                      3.96 per cent per annum, with interest calculated daily and payable monthloyv  er the 
                      life of the facility. 
                      In August 2018, the Australian Government agreed to extend the term of this loan by 
                      three years (to 30 June 2024). The decision will be implemented by agreement, which 
                      will be subject to the approval of the Government. 
                      A Government loan on commercial terms continues to represent the most cost-effective 
                      way to raise necessary debt and secure funding to complete the rollout of this 
                      important national infrastructure project. A Government loan aistsss  in ensuring 
                      NBN Co can focus on the remaining rollout as it significantly scales up toward 
                      completion in 2020. 
                      Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
                      The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has developed a portfolio of loans and 
                      investments across the spectrum of clean energy technologies, as required by the 
                      Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 20.1 T2 his portfolio has an acceptable but not

           Statement 8: Statement of Risks 
           The CEFC’s loan portfolio consists of predominantly senio-rranking, secured loans, 
           and secured project finance facilities, typically secured against egneenergyra-ting 
           assets such as wind or solar farms or biogas facilities or energyeff iciency assets. The 
           CEFC has predominantly made loans as a co-financier either jointly or in consortiums 
           with private sector financial institutions. Interest rates vary with a current average 
           expected return of approximately 4.6 per cent. Loans haver iovusa  maturity dates, 
           typically in the range of– 515 years. As at 30 June loa2018ns c,  ontracted and 
           outstanding are expected to total $2.470 billion. 
           Commonwealth-State Financing Arrangements — Housing and Specific 
           Purpose Capital 
           From 1945 to 1989, tuhsetra Alian Government made concessional advances to the 
           state and Northern Territo ryGovernments under CommonwealthS–tate financing 
           arrangements for housing and for specific purpose capital. The advances are 
           concessional fixed-rate loans to be repaid over 53 years, with the last loans maturing in 
           2042. Annual payments, comprising both interest and princpial repayment, are made 
           by the states and the Northern Territory. As at 30 June 2091, the estimated amortised 
           value of the advances is $1.7 billion (and principal value of $1.9 billion). 
           The Australian Office of Financial Management manages the receipt of interest and 
           principal repayments from the state and Northern Territory Governments. 
           National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility 
           The National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility (the loan facility), available since 
           2016-17, addresses gaps in the capital market for water infrastructure projects, 
           stimulating and accelerating state and territory government investments in water 
           infrastructure in regional areas (including public/private partnerships). This includes, 
           but is not limited to, the construction of dams, pipelines and managed aquifer recharge 
           projects that are economically viable and will generate affordable water to grow 
           regional economies. 
           The loan faciltiy will make available $2 billion until 20–2256 in loans. Loans have a 
           maximum term of 30 years. The loans include a no repayment period of up to 5 years 
           during construction. During the construction period, interest will be capitalised, 
           becoming payable as part of the principal after the deferred repayment period. Loan 
           principal and interest are required to be repaid within 25 years of the completion of 
           construction. 
           Loans are for a minimum amount of $10 million. Total Commonwealth funding for a 
           water infrastructure project would not exceed 49 per cent of the total project cost (from 
           all sources). In practice, this means eligible projects would have a minimum cost of at 
           least $20.4 million. 
           The loan facility is administered by the Regional Investment Corporation.

                    accelerate Stage 2 of the WestConnex project. The ccessioonnal loan assisted in 
                    ensuring finance for the New M5, thereby accelerating delivery of Stage 2 and allowing 
                    Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the project to be built concurrently. Stage 2 comprises the 
                    King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade that is now complete and the New M5 that is 
                    currently under construction.

                    and revised in accordance with material changes in the five-year Commonwealth bond 
                    rate. Loans have a maximum term of five years, with an extenuating circumstances 
                    clause in some jurisdictions, which allows a maximum tw-oyear extension to the loan 
                    at commercial rates.

                         Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator 
                         The Australian Government, through the Treasury, has made available a line of credit 
                         for the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation’s (NHFIC) Affordable 
                         Housing Bond Aggregator (AHBA). The provision of funds will be in accordance with 
                         appropriations under the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Act 2018. 
                         The line of credit is ongoing and funds borrowed will be repaid with interest. The 
                         Treasury manages the receipt of interest and principal repayments from the NHFIC. 
                         International Monetary Fund New Arrangements to Borrow 
                         Australia has made a line of credit available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
                         under its New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) since 1998. On 4 November 2016, the 
                         IMF Executive Board agreed to renew the NAB for an additional five-year period to 
                         16 November 2022. The NAB is a contingent loan to help ensure that the IMF has the 
                         resources available to maintain stability and support recovery in the global economy. 
                         The funds are drawn upon by the IMF as needed to supplemen tthe IMF’s usual quota 
                         resources and will be repaid in full with interest. It is expected that the fair value of 
                         loans outstanding to Australia will be approximately A$310 million as at 30 June 2019.

                                  The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) requires that the Budget be based 
                                  on external reporting standards and that departures from applicable external reporting 
                                  standards be identified. 
                                  The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:

                                  The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis that complies with 
                                  both the ABS GFS and AAS, except for departures disclosed at Note 2. A more detailed 
                                  description of the AAS and the ABS GFS frameworks, in addition to definitions of key 
                                  terms used in these frameworks, can be found in Appendix A. Detailed accounting

                                  Fiscal reporting focuses on the general government sector (GGS). The GGS provides 
                                  public services that are mainly n-markonet in nature and for the collective 
                                  consumption of the community, or involve the transfer or redistribution of income. 
                                  These services are largely financed through taes ax                         nd other compulsory levie s.This 
                                  sector comprises all government departments, offices and some other bodies. In 
                                  preparing financial statements for the GGS, all material transactions and balances 
                                  between entities within the GGS have been eliminated. 
                                  The  Government’s key fiscal aggregates are based on tAheB S GFS concepts and 
                                  definitions, including the ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit and the derivation of the 
                                  underlying cash balance and net financial worth. AASB 1049 requires the disclosure of 
                                  other ABS GFS fiscal aggregates, including net operating balance, net 
                                  lending/borrowing (fiscal balance) and net worth. In addition to these ABS GFS 
                                  aggregates,  the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) requires disclosure of net 
                                  debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities. 
                                  AASB 1049 and the UPF also provide a basis for reporting of the public non-financial 
                                  corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors and the total 
                                  non-financial public sector (NFPS).

                         AASB 1049 requires disaggregated inrfomation, by ABS GFS function, for expenses 
                         and total assets to be disclosed where they are reliably attributable. TheAB    S GFS does 
                         not require total assets to be attributed to functions. In accordance with theAB  S GFS, 
                         disaggregated information for expenses and net acquisition of nonfin- ancial assets by 
                         function is disclosed in Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment. In accordance 
                         with the UPF, purchases of nonfin-ancial assets by function are also disclosed in 
                         Statement 5. 
                         AASB 1055 requires major variances between original budget estimates and outcomes 
                         to be explained in the financial statements. Explanations of variations in fiscal balance,

                         disclosed in Statemen t3:  Fiscal Strategy and Outlook, with decisions taken since the 
                         MYEFO disclosed in Budget Paper No. 2 Budget Measures 2019-20. All policy decisions 
                         taken between the 280-119  Budget and the 280-119  MYEFO are disclosed in 
                         Appendix A of the MYEFO.

                         Note 2: Departures from external reporting standards 
                         The Charter requires that departures from applicable external reporting standards be 
                         identified. The major  differences between AAS and  the  ABS GFS treatments of 
                         transactions are outlined in Table 13. 
                         AASB 1049 requires AAS measurement of items to be disclosed on the faocfe  the 
                         financial statements with reconciliation to theA  BS GFS measurement of key fiscal

                         AAS measurement of items outlined above and reconciliation have not been included 
                         as they would effectively create different measures of the same aggregate.

                          (a)  For budget reporting purposes, a  discount rate of 5 per cent used by actuaries in preparing the           
                              2017 Long-Term Cost Reports is used to value the superannuation liability. This reflects the average 
                              annual rate estimated to apply over the term of the liability and it reduces the volatility in reported 
                              liabilities that would occur from year to year if the spot rates on long-term government bonds were used. 
                              Consistent with AAS, the superannuation liability for the 201-178 Final Budget Outcome (FBO) was 
                              calculated using the spot rates on long-term government bond sas at 30 June 2018 that best matched

                             APPENDIX A: FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AND 
                                                     BUDGET CONCEPTS 
                        The Budget primarily focuses on the financial performance and position of the general 
                        government sector (GGS). The GGS provid  epsublic services that  are mainly 
                        non-market in nature and for the collective consumption of the community, or involve 
                        the transfer or redistribution of income. These services are largely financed through 
                        taxes and other compulsory levies. AASB 1049 recognises the GGS as a reporting 
                        entity. 
                        AASB 1049 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
                        AASB 1049 seeks to ‘harmonise’ the ABS GFS and AAS. 
                        The reporting framework for AASB 1049 requires the preparation of ac-cbruaseald 
                        general purpose financial reports, showing government assets, liabilities, revenue, 
                        expenses and cash flows. GGS reportnig under AASB 1049 aims to provide users with 
                        information about the stewardship of each government in relation to its GGS and 
                        accountability for the resources entrusted to it; information about the financial 
                        position, performance and cash flows of each government’s GGS; and information that 
                        facilitates assessments of the macroeconomic impact. While AASB 1049 provides a 
                        basis for whole of government  (including the PNFC and PFC sec, toreprs)orting 
                        focuses on the GGS. 
                        AASB 1049 has adopted the AAS conceptual framework and principles for the 
                        recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and their presentation, 
                        measurement and disclosure. In addition, AASB 1049 has broadly adopted the ABS 
                        GFS conceptual framework for presenting government financiaatlem sent ts. In 
                        particular, AASB 1049 requires the GGS to prepare a separate set of financial 
                        statements, overriding AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Stateme nAASBts.     1049 also 
                        follows  the  ABS GFS by requiring changes in net worth to be split into either 
                        transactions or ‘other economic flows’ and for this to be presented in a single operating 
                        statement. AASB 1049 is therefore broadly consistent with international statistical 
                        standards and the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Government Finance Statistics 
                        Manual 2014.1

                               All financial data presented in the financial statements are recorded as either stocks

                               flows’). Transactions result from a mutually agreed interaction betn eweeconomic 
                               entities. Despite their compulsory nature, taxes are transactions deemed to occur by 
                               mutual agreement between the government and the taxpayer. Transactions that 
                               increase or decrease net worth (assets less liabilities) are reported as revendu es an

                               A change to the value or volume of an asset or liability that does not result from a

                               market prices, most actuarial valuations and exchange rates, and changes in volumes 
                               from discoveries, depletion and destruction. All o‘ ther economic flows’ are reported in 
                               the operating statement. 
                               Consistent with the ABS GFS framework, and in general AAS, the financial statements 
                               record flows in the period in which they occur. As a result, prior period outcomes may 
                               be revised for classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have 
                               been expected to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods 
                               and can be reliably assigned to the relevant period(s). 
                               Operating statement 
                               The operating statement presents details of transactions in revenues, expenses, the net 
                               acquisition of non-financial assets (net capital investment) and other economic flows 
                               for an accounting period. 
                               Revenues arise from transactions that increase net worth and expenses arise from 
                               transactions that decrease net worth. Revenues less expenses gives the net operating 
                               balance. The net operating balance is similar to the National Accounts concept of 
                               government saving plus capital transfers. 
                               The net acquisition of nonf-inancial assets (net capital investment) equals gross fixed 
                               capital formation, less depreciation, plus changes (investment) in inventories, plus 
                               other transactions in non-financial assets. 
                               ‘Other economic flows’ are presented in the operating statement and outline changes 
                               in net worth that are driven by economic flows other than revenues and expenses. 
                               Revenues, expenses and o‘ther economic flows’ sum to the total change in net worth 
                               during a period. The majority of ‘other economic flows’ for the Australian Government 
                               GGS arise from price movements in its assets and liabilities. 
                                                                                          
                               2    Not all transactions impact on net worth. For example, transactions in financial assets and 
                                    liabilities do not impact on net worth as they represent the swapping of assets and liabilities 
                                    on the balance sheet. 
                                                                                     9-35 
                               Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
                               Net operating balance 
                               The net operating balance is the excess of revenue from transactions over exes pens
                               from transactions. The net operating balance excludes expenditure on the acquisition 
                               of capital assets, but includes n-cashon costs such as accruing superannuation 
                               entitlements and the consumption of capital (depreciation). By including all accruing 
                               costs, including depreciation, the net operating balance encompasses the full current 
                               cost of providing government services. This makes it a measure of the sustainability of 
                               the governmen’ts fiscal position over time and provides an indication of the 
                               sustainability of the existing level of government services. 
                               The net operating balance is a flow measure in the operating statement. 
                               Fiscal balance 
                               The fiscal balance (or net lending/borrowing) is the net operating balance less net 
                               capital investment. Thus, the fiscal balance includes the impact of net expenditure 
                               (effectively purchases less sales) on n-finaonncial assets rather than consumption 
                               (depreciation) of non-financial assets.3
                                                                                  
                               The fiscal balance measures the Australian Governmen’ts investment-saving balance. 
                               It measures in accrual terms the gap between government savings plus net capital 
                               transfers, and investment in nofinnan-cial assets. As such, it approximates the 
                               contribution of the Australian Government GGS to the balance on the current account 
                               in the balance of payments. 
                               Balance sheet 
                               The balance sheet shows stocks of assets, liabilities and net worth. In accordance with 
                               the UPF, net debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities are also reported in 
                               the balance sheet. 
                               Net worth 
                               The net worth of the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors is defined as assets less liabilities. 
                               This differs from the ABS GFS definition for the PNFC and PFC sectors where net 
                               worth is defined as assets less liabilities less shares and other contributed capital. 
                               Net worth is an economic measure of wealth, reflecting the Australian Governmen’s t
                               contribution to the wealth of Australia. 
                                
                                                                                          
                               3    The net operating balance includes consumption of non-financial assets because depreciation 
                                    is an expense. Depreciation is deducted in the calculation of net capital investment as the full 
                                    investment in non-financial assets is included in the calculation of fiscal balance.  
                                                                                     9-36 
                                                                 Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements 
                               Net financial worth 
                               Net financial worth measures a government’s net holdings of financial assets. It is 
                               calculated from the balance sheet as financial assets minus liabilities. This differs from 
                               the ABS GFS definition of net financial worth for the PNFC and PFC sectors, defined as 
                               financial assets, less liabilities, less shares and other contributed capital. Net financial 
                               worth is a broader measure than net debt, in that it incorporates provisions made (such 
                               as superannuation) as well as holdings of equity. Net financial worth includes all 
                               classes of financial assets and all liabilities, only some of which ae inr cluded in net 
                               debt. As non-financial assets are excluded from net financial worth, this is a narrower 
                               measure than net worth. However, it avoids the concerns inherent with the net worth 
                               measure relating to the valuation of non-financial assets and their availability to offset 
                               liabilities. 
                               Net financial liabilities 
                               Net financial liabilities comprises total liabilities less financial assets but excludes 
                               equity investments in the other sectors of the jurisdiction. Net financial liabilities is a 
                               more accurate indicator than net debt of a jurisdictions ’ fiscal position as it includes 
                               substantial non debt liabilities such as accrued superannuation and long service leave 
                               entitlements. Excluding the net worth of other sectors in government results in a purer 
                               measure of financial worth than net financial worth, as, in general, the net worth of 
                               other sectors of government, in particular the PNFC sector, is backed up by physical 
                               assets. 
                               Net debt 
                               Net debt is the sum of selected financial liabilities (deposits held, advances received, 
                               government securities, loans, and other borrowing) less the sum of selected financial 
                               assets4
                                          (cash and deposits, advances paid, and investments, loans and placements). 
                               This includes financial assets held by the Future Fund which are invested in these asset 
                               classes, including term deposits and investments in collective investment vehicles. Net 
                               debt does not include superannuation related liabilities. Net debt is a common 
                               measure of the strength of a governmen’ts financial position. High levels of net debt 
                               impose a call on future revenue flows to service that debt. 
                               The 2015 ABS GFS Manual presents debt in a matrix format, with no single net debt 
                               aggregate identified. The Commonwealth Government continues to report net debt in 
                               accordance with the UPF as described above. 
                                                                                          
                               4    Financial assets are defined as cash, an equity instrument of another entity, a contractual 
                                    right to receive cash or financial asset, and a contract that will or may be settled in the 
                                    entity’s own equity instruments. 
                                                                                     9-37 
                               Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
                               The new Austrailan Accounting Standard, AASB 16 Lea, asespplies to all Australian 
                               Government entities from 1 July 2019. The effect of AASB 16 is to introduce a single 
                               lease accounting framework. This is achieved by removing the current distinction 
                               between operating and finance leases. As a result, leases that were previously 
                               accounted for as operating expenses and payments will be included as additional 
                               assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. The new standard will have implications for 
                               a number of budget aggregates; in particular, there will be a worsening of net debt, net 
                               financial worth and the fiscal balance. It will not have a material impact on the 
                               underlying cash balance. The estimates will be updated to reflect the changed 
                               treatment of leases following finalisation of implementation arrangements. 
                               Cash flow statement 
                               The cash flow statement identifies how cash is generated and applied in a single 
                               accounting period. The cash flow statement reflects a cash basis of recording (rather 
                               than an accrual basis) where information is derived indirectly from underlying accrual 
                               transactions and movements in balances. This, in effect, means that transactions are 
                               captured when cash is received or when cash payments are made. Cash transactions 
                               are specifically identified because cash management is considered an integral function 
                               of accrual budgeting. 
                               Underlying cash balance 
                               The underlying cash balance plus net Future Fund earnings is the cash counterpart of 
                               the fiscal balance, reflecting the Australian Govern’s cmenatsh investmet-nsaving 
                               balance. 
                               For the GGS, the underlying cash balance is calculated as shown below: 
                                        Net cash flows from operating activities 
                                        plus 
                                        Net cash flows from investments in non-financial assets 
                                        equals 
                                        ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit 
                                        less 
                                        Net acquisitions of ats asse cquired under finance leases and similar 
                                        arrangements5
                                                            
                                        less 
                                        Net Future Fund cash earnings 
                                        equals 
                                        Underlying cash balance 
                                                                                          
                               5    The underlying cash balance treats the acquisition and disposal of non-financial assets in the 
                                    same manner regardless of whether they occur by purchase/sale or finance l— ease 
                                    acquisitions reduce the underlying cash balance and disposals increase the underlying cash 
                                    balance. However, finance leases don ot generate cash flows at the time of acquisition or 
                                    disposal equivalent to the value of the asset. As such, net acquisitions of assets under finance 
                                    leases are not shown in the body of the cash flow statement but are reported as a 
                                    supplementary item for the calculation of the underlying cash balance. 
                                                                                     9-38 
                                                                 Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements 
                               Under the Future Fund Act 2006, earnings are required to be reinvested to meet the 
                               Government’s future public sector superannua tiliaonbilities.  The Government 
                               excludes net Future Fund cash earnings from the calculation of the underlying cash 
                               balance between 2005-06 and 201920- . From 20202-1 onwards, net Future Fund cash 
                               earnings are included in the calculation of the underlying cash balance because the 
                               Future Fund becomes available to meet the Governmen’s sut                           perannuation liabilities

                                       onwards where applicable. 
                                  •    Cash data prior to 19992000 -                  are sourced from ABS data, which have been

                                  COMPARABILITY OF DATA ACROSS YEARS 
                                  The data set contains a number of structural breaks owing to accounting classification 
                                  differences and changes to the structure of the budget which cannot be eliminated 
                                  through back-casting because of data limitations. These breaks can affect the 
                                  comparability of data across years, especially when the analysis is taken over a large 
                                  number of years. Specific factors causing structural breaks include: 
                                  •    From 2005-06 onwards, underlying Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data are 
                                       provided by agencies in accordance with Australian Accounting Satndards (AAS), 
                                       which includes International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in 
                                       Australia. Prior to 200-506, underlying GFS data are based on data provided by 
                                       agencies applying AAS prior to the adoption of IFRS. 
                                                                                             10-3 
                                  Statement 10: Historical Australian Government Data 
                                  •    Most recent accounting classification changes that require revisions to the historical 
                                       series have been back-cast (where applicable) to 199899,- ensuring that data are 
                                       consistent across the accrual period from 1998-99 onwards. However, because of 
                                       data limitations, these changes have not been back-cast to earlier years. 
                                  •    Prior  to 19992000-, Australian Government general government sector debt 
                                       instruments are valued at historic cost, whereas from 199-92000 onwards they are 
                                       valued at market prices (consistent with accrual GFS standards). This affects net 
                                       debt and net interest payments. 
                                  •    Cash data up to and including 199798 ar-                         e calculated under a cash accounting 
                                       framework, while cash data from 199899 o- nwards are derived from an accrual 
                                       accounting framework.1 Although the major methodological differences associated 
                                       with the move to the accrual framework have been eliminated through 
                                       back-casting, comparisons across the break may still be affected by changes to some 
                                       data sources and collection methodologies. 
                                  •    Adjustments  in the coverage of agencies are included in the accounts of the 
                                       different sectors. These include the reclassification of Central Banking Authorities 
                                       from the general government to the public financial corporations sector in 199-899, 
                                       and subsequent back-casting to account for this change. 
                                  •    Changes  have been made  in arrangements for transfer payments, where tax 
                                       concessions or rebates are replaced by payments through the social security system. 
                                       This has the effect of increasing both cash receipts and payments, as compared with 
                                       earlier periods, but not changing cash balances. Changes in the opposite direction 
                                       reduce both cash payments and receipts. 
                                  •    Classification differences in the data relating to the period prior to 197-677 mean 
                                       that earlier data may not be entirely consistent with data for 1976-77 onwards. 
                                  REVISIONS TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED DATA 
                                  Under the accrual GFS framework and generally under AAS, flows are recorded in the 
                                  period in which they occurred. As a result, prior period outcomes may be revised for 
                                  classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have been expected 
                                  to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods, and can be 
                                  reliably assigned to the relevant period(s). 
                                  There have been no material classification changes that have resulted in back-casting in 
                                  this update. 
                                                                                             
                                  1    Prior to the 2008-09 Budget, cash data calculated under the cash accounting framework was 
                                       used up to and including 199-899. In the 2008-09 Budget, cash data prior to 1998-99 have 
                                       been replaced by ABS data derived from the accrual framework.
