               or policy has a suspected risk of causing severe harm to the public            of causing severe harm to the public domain (such as
               domain(affecting general health or the environment globally), the action       general health or the environment), and in the absence

               harm falls on those proposing an action, not those opposing it. PP is          proposing the action. It is meant to deal with effects of
               intended to deal with uncertainty and risk in cases where the absence
               of evidence and the incompleteness of scientiﬁc knowledge carries              absence of evidence and the incompleteness of scientiﬁc

                  This non-naive version of the PP allows us to avoid paranoia and            extreme situations: when the potential harm is systemic
               paralysis by conﬁning precaution to speciﬁc domains and problems.              (rather than localized) and the consequences can involve
               Here we formalize PP, placing it within the statistical and probabilistic      total irreversible ruin, such as the extinction of human
               structure of “ruin” problems, in which a system is at risk of total failure,

               policy option, do not apply, as outcomes may have inﬁnite costs. Even          properties of complex systems. Our aim is to allow
               high-beneﬁt, high-probability outcomes do not outweigh the existence           decision makers to discern which circumstances require
               of low probability, inﬁnite cost options—i.e. ruin. Uncertainties result in    the use of the PP and in which cases evoking the PP is
