                          How to Write a Paper 
                          6th Edition, February 2005 
         
                          Introduction 
         
         
                          This brief manual gives guidance in writing a paper about your 
         
                          research. Most of the advice applies equally to your thesis or to 
                          writing a research proposal. The content of the paper reflects the 
         
                          kind of work you have done: experimental, theoretical, 
                          computational. I have used, as a model, a typical Materials project: 
         
                          one combining experiment with modeling and computation to 
                          explain some aspect of material behaviour. 
         
                           
         
                          Sections 1 to 8 give guidelines for clear writing with brief 
                          examples.  The Appendix contains longer examples of effective 
         
                          and ineffective writing. The manual is prescriptive—it has to be, if it 
         
                          is to be short.  It is designed to help those struggling with their first 
                          paper, or those who have written several but find it difficult. Certain 
         
                          sections may seem to you to be elementary; they are there 
                          because, to others, they are not.   Section 8, on Style, is open-
         
                          ended, the starting point for more exciting things.

                       1  THE DESIGN  
        
        
                       Well-written papers are read, remembered, cited. Poorly written 
        
                       papers are not.   
        
                       To write well, you need a design. Like any design activity, there 
        
                       are a number of steps (Figure 1). I’ve used the language of 
                       engineering design here—it fits well. 
        
        
                       The Market Need. What is the purpose of the document?  Who 
                       will read it?  How will the reader use it?  The answers help you 
        
                       decide the length, the level of detail, the style. 
        
                       The Concept. Good writing starts with a plan.  Writers have 
        
                       different ways of developing plans. I find the concept-sheet 
                       (Section 3, below) is a good way to do it. 
        
        
                        
        
                        
        
        
                        
        
                        
        
        
                        
        
                        
        
        
                        
        
                       Figure 1. The Design Process. Designing a paper is like designing 
        
                       anything else: there are five essential steps.  
        
                       The Embodiment. The embodiment is the first draft. Get the facts 
        
                       down on paper without worrying about style; make drafts of each 
                       section; develop the calculations; sketch the figures; assemble

                     Detail. Now comes the crafting: clarity, balance, readability; in a 
        
                     word —style. 
        
                     The End-Product. Appearance is important: good layout, clear 
        
                     headings, well-designed figures. 
        
                     The Sections that follow expand on each of these in turn. 
        
        
                     2  THE MARKET—Who are your readers?
        
        
                     Your market is your readers. Put yourself in their shoes: what, if 
        
                     you were they, would you wish to find? 
        
                     The readers of your thesis are your examiners. They expect 
        
                     details of all relevant parts of your research: why you did it, its 
                     background, your thinking, what you did, your conclusions and 
                     your views on where it is going.  They don’t want the irrelevant 
                     parts—details of how standard equipment works, for instance. Find 
                     out as much as you can about content and format from your 
                     supervisor and other students, and look at some recent 
                     (successful) theses to get a feel for the product this market 
                     expects. 
                     A paper is read by one or more skilled referees, and, if accepted, 
                     by a scientifically-informed audience. This manual focuses on 
                     writing papers. The pages that follow explain how this market 
                     should be addressed. 
                     A research proposal usually addresses two markets. One is the 
                     funding agency: the EPSRC, the EU, another Government 
                     Agencies, or a Charity. They will look for a match between their 
                     priorities and yours. The other is the referees that the funding 
                     agency will use; they are charged with judging quality, promise

                               4        
                     and relevance.  
                     Hardest to write is a popular article, addressing an audience who 
                     is  intelligent—one should always assume that—but who may 
                     know nothing of your subject. Here style, always important, must 
                     be fine-tuned to meet their needs. More on style in Section 8. 
                     Make no mistake. Write poorly and you’ll bore, exasperate and 
                     ultimately lose your readers. Write well, and they’ll respond in the 
                     way you plan.

                     3  CONCEPT—Making a Concept-Sheet 
                     When you can’t write, it is because you don’t know what you want 
                     to say. The first job is to structure your thinking. Settle down 
                     comfortably with a cup of coffee (or better, beer) and an A3 sheet

                               5        
                                             of paper in Landscape orientation as in Figure 3. Devise a 
                                             tentative title for the paper and write it at the top. Then—in as 
                                             orderly way as you can, but disorder is OK too—jot down what 
                                             seem like sensible section headings, each in its own box. Sketch 
                                             in anything that occurs to you that belongs in a section—
                                             paragraph headings, figures, ideas. Think of things that might be 
                                             relevant to the section—a reference, a graph you might need, an 
                                             idea that requires further development. Put each in a bubble near 
                                             the box to which it applies, with an arrow showing where it fits in. 
                                             This is the time to de-focus, forget the detail and think both 
                                             longitudinally and laterally.

                                                                 6              
                  What should be in the paper? What else might be relevant? What 
                  else might you need to do the job—a copy of X, a figure of Y, the 
                  reference Z? Put it all down. You realise that you need an extra 
                  section—squeeze it in. You see that the order of sections is not 
                  good—add arrows indicating the new order. 
                  All this sounds like a child’s game, but it is not. Its value lies in the 
                  freedom of thought it permits. Your first real act of composition 
                  (this one) is to allow your thinking to range over the entire paper, 
                  exploring ways in which the pieces might fit together, recording the 
                  resources you will need and capturing ideas. That way, no matter 
                  which part you start drafting, you have an idea of the whole. Don’t 
                  yet think of style, neatness or anything else. Just add, at the 
                  appropriate place on the sheet, your thoughts. This can be the 
                  most satisfying step of writing a paper. Later steps can take time, 
                  be hard work, sometimes like squeezing water out of stone. But 
                  not this—it is the moment to be creative in whatever way your 
                  ideas may lead. You can add to the sheet at any time It becomes a 
                  road-map of where you are going. 
                  Figure 4 shows, unexpurgated, the concept sheet I made while 
                  thinking about this manual. Some bits were already planned; most 
                  developed in the hour I spent making the sheet; a few were added 
                  later, after some sections had been drafted. It is a mess, notes to 
                  oneself, but it guides the subsequent, more tedious, part of the 
                  journey. It is possible that this starting point may not work for you, 
                  but try it more than once before you abandon it. It is the best way I 
                  know to break writers-block and launch the real writing of the 
                  paper.

                                                 stages in writing a paper are set out in the boxes below. Papers 
                                                 are not drafted sequentially; do it in any order you wish. Get the 
                                                 scientific facts and technical details down, the ideas formulated,

                                                 ideas occur to you now, use them; but do not deflect effort from 
                                                 the key job of assembling the pieces, in whatever form them come.

                                                 •    Try for one sentence each on motive, method, key results, 
                                                      conclusions. 
                                                 •    Don’t exceed 3 sentences on any one. 
                                                 The reader of an Abstract has been lured by the title. He or she 
                                                 now want to know whether to read on. Tell them, in as few 
                                                 sentences as possible, what they will find. No waffle, no spurious 
                                                 details. Try not to exceed 100 words. Imagine that you are paying 
                                                 a 10p a word. See the Appendix for an example.

                                                 •    What is the problem and why is it interesting? 
                                                 •    Who are the main contributors? 
                                                 •    What did they do? 
                                                 •    What novel thing will you reveal? 
                                                 Outline the problem and why it was worth tackling. Review the 
                                                 literature, recording briefly the main contributors and summarising 
                                                 the status of the field when you started the research. Provide any 
                                                 specialised information that the reader might need if he is to 
                                                 understand what follows. State what you will do that has not been 
                                                 done before (new experimental approach? new data? new model? 
                                                 new interpretation?) Keep it as brief as you can whilst still doing all 
                                                 this. 
                                                 Start with a good first sentence—see Section 8 for examples.

                                                 •    Experimental paper: equipment, materials, method 
                                                      Modelling paper: assumptions, mathematical tools, 
                                                 method 
                                                      Computational paper: inputs, computational tools, method 
                                                 •    Explain what is especially different about your method. 
                                                 •    Give sufficient detail that the reader can reproduce what 
                                                      you did. 
                                                 •    Don’t mix Method with Results or Discussion—they come 
                                                      next. 
                                                 This should be an easy section to write: just say what you did, 
                                                 succinctly. Use “we” but do so sparingly: too many “we’s” sounds 
                                                 like a child’s day out: “first we did this, then we did that.”   
                                                 Build up a reference list as you go. See Section 4.10 for the way to 
                                                 deal with references. 
                                                 It is one of the principles of science that a paper should contain 
                                                 sufficient detail to allow the work to be repeated by someone else.  
                                                 Provide this but no more.  Keep the results for the next section.  
                                                   
                                                 4.6 RESULTS 
                                                 •    Present the output of the experiments, model or 
                                                      computation. 
                                                 •    Don’t mix Results with Discussion.  It belongs—all of it—in 
                                                      4.7.

                                                 This, too, should be an easy section to write.  Report your results 
                                                 simply, without opinion or interpretation at this stage.  Define all 
                                                 symbols and units.  Present data in a form other people can use.  
                                                 Give emphasis in the text the most important aspects of the tables, 
                                                 graphs or figures.  Give error-bars or confidence-limits for 
                                                 numerical or graphical data.  Statistics should be meaningful; 
                                                 avoid confidence-eroding statements such as  “33.3% of the

                                                 materials behave as they do, and this requires ideas about 
                                                 mechanisms, models and associated theory. The function of the

                                                 drawn up, micrographs printed and references assembled. Do not 
                                                 tinker with the text yet. It is a good idea to have a check-list like the 
                                                 one on the last page of this manual; it helps you see where you 
                                                 are.

                  …………Time has passed.  The draft has matured for 48 hours or 
                  more.  Now we must address the details. 
                   
                  5  DETAIL I:  Grammar 
                  Grammar tells the reader the function of words and their 
                  relationship.  Mess up the grammar and you confuse the reader. 
                  What follows is a brief summary of the simplest essentials of 
                  grammar.   
                   
                  5.1 The parts of speech 
                  Parts of speech are descriptors for the functions of words. There 
                  are eight. 
                    Nouns are the names of peoples or thing: Instron, metal, 
                  computer,  foam. 
                  Nouns can be used as adjectives.  When so used, they are 
                  generally hyphenated to the noun they qualify: table-tennis, metal-
                  foam, computer-power. 
                    Pronouns stand for nouns: he, she, it, they. 
                    Adjectives qualify nouns: a small Instron, a red metal, a digital 
                  computer, an intricate foam. 
                    Verbs signify being or action: is, seems, go, interpret, 
                  understand. 
     How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                          17     
                  Transitive verbs have a subject and an object: The load / deforms / 
                  the material. 
                  Intransitive verbs have no object: Flowers / bloom. The research / 
                  evolved. 
                  “Being” verbs have a complement: The test / was / completed. The 
                  theory / seemed / correct. (“Completed” and “correct” are 
                  complements) 
                  Many verbs have both a transitive and an intransitive form: Time / 
                  passed. And: Pass the biscuits. 
                    Adverbs qualify verbs: today we interpret this differently. 
                    Conjunctions link words and sentences: and, but, because... 
                    Prepositions precede nouns, usually having to do with place or 
                  time: on the table, after this procedure, on the graph, from the 
                  appendix. 
                         are exclamations; the polite ones include: Alas! 
                   Interjections
                  Great! Cheers! Many are impolite. They are inappropriate in 
                  technical writing. 
                   
                  5.2 Sentence structure 
                  A simple sentence has a subject and a predicate. 
                            
                    Subject                                       Predicate 
                            The sample                                 failed. 
                            The measurements                     fell into two classes. 
                            Fatigue-loading                         causes microstructural damage .
     How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                          18     
                  The subject identifies what or whom the sentence is about. 
                  The predicate, containing a verb, says something about the 
                  subject. 
                  5.3 Phrases and clauses 
                  Phrases and clauses are groups of words that do the jobs of the 
                  parts of speech listed on Section 5.1.   
                  A phrase is a group of words that does not contain a verb. 
                  Type of phrase        Example 
                  Noun phrase           The interpretation of the experiment presents a 
                          problem. 
                  Adjective phrase    The red and white striped cable is live. 
                  Adverbial phrase    We examined the results with considerable care. 
                           The test ended owing to the fact that the specimen   
                  Conjunctive phrase
                          failed. 
                  Avoid the last of these; there is always a simpler, one-word 
                  conjunction (here: “because”).   
                  A clause contains a verb and its subject or object. Sentences are 
                  made by linking clauses. A sentence made with two equal clauses 
                  (each a separate sentence but linked together) is called a 
                  compound sentence.  A sentence made with a main clause linked 
                  to one or more subordinate clauses, which cannot stand by 
                  themselves as separate sentences, is called a complex sentence.  
                  Adjective clauses do the work of adjectives; adverb clauses do the 
                  work of adverbs.

                                                                      Type of Clause           Example 
                                                                      Adjective clause         A computation that uses FE methods is 
                                                                                                           appropriate. 
                                                                      Adverb clause            The modem will operate wherever a phone-line 
                                                                                                            is available. 
                                                                       
                                                                      5.4 Compound sentences 
                                                                      A compound sentence has two co-ordinate (“equal”) clauses linked 
                                                                      by a conjunction: 
                                                                             We measured the temperature and (we) adjusted the thermostat. 
                                                                             The tooling cost is high but the material cost is low. 
                                                                      The parts of a compound sentence must be of comparable weight.  
                                                                      “We analysed the microstructures using SEM and left for lunch at

                                                                      A complex sentence has a main clause and a subordinate clause: 
                                                                      What these results signify / is the subject of a paper by Wegst

                                                                      Maine (1998) demonstrates / that technical cost modelling is

                                                                                                      20                    
                           5.6 “that” and “which” 
                           “The computations that were performed on a Cray were the more 
                           accurate.”  
                           “The computations, which were performed on a Cray, were the 
                           more accurate.”  
                           These two sentences appear at first sight to say the same thing, 
                           but they do not. The italicised part of the first sentence is an 
                           adjective clause, qualifying the word “computations”; it has the 
                           effect of limiting the computations the sentence is talking about to 
                           the ones done on the a Cray, as distinct (say) from those done on 
                           a Silicon Graphics work station. Adjective clauses are just like 
                           adjectives; they are not separated from the noun they qualify by 
                           commas. 
                           The italicised part of the second sentence, separated by commas 
                           from the rest, adds a new factor of equal importance to that 
                           contained in the main sentence. The two statements are: the 
                           computations were performed on a Cray; and they were more 
                           accurate. The emphases of the two sentences differ. The italicised 
                           clause in the first sentence is subordinate, merely qualifying the 
                           noun. The italicised clause in the second sentence is co-ordinate, 
                           meaning that it introduces a new fact. 
                            
                           6   DETAIL II:  Spelling 
                           Use the spell-checker on your computer, but remember that it will 
                           fail to distinguish “their” from “there”, “form” from “from”, “its” from 
                           “it’s”, and many more. Watch out particularly for “effect” and 
                           “affect”, “principle” and “principal”, “dependent” and “dependant”, 
                           “compliment” and “complement”.

                                        21        
                          Most word ending in “-ise” can also be spelt “-ize”, but not all. If, 
                          like me, spelling is one of your lesser talents, use “-ise”. 
                          And when in doubt, use a dictionary.  
                           
                          7   DETAIL III:  Punctuation 
                          Punctuation orders prose and sends signals to the reader about 
                          how to interpret it. Good sentence structure and punctuation 
                          makes reading flow; it warns of what is to come; it helps the reader 
                          read without having to re-read. Meaning is changed, sometimes 
                          dramatically, by punctuation. It is one of the toolboxes of good 
                          writing. The next three pages give a resume, but if you really want 
                          the low-down on punctuation, and to be entertained at the same 
                          time read “Eats, Shoots and Leaves” by Lynne Truss, listed under 
                          “Further Reading” at the end of this manual. 
                          7.1 The full stop, or period       
                                                     .
                          The full stop is used to mark the end of a declarative sentence, 
                          and to signify abbreviation:     Dr. A. M. K. Esawi, Ph.D.  
                          7.2 The comma  , 
                          The comma keeps apart two words or larger parts of a sentence 
                          which would confuse if they touched. Forget any rules you have 
                          heard about the comma and simply used it when it improves the 
                          sense of the sentence.  Try the sentence with and without the 
                          comma; keep it if, without it, the sentence becomes ambiguous.  
                          Thus:   
                          The measurements employed a photo-diode and a laser was used to

                                      22         
                           check adjustment requires a comma after photo-diode to avoid a 
                           momentary misinterpretation, slowing the reader down
                                                                 .  
                           7.3 The semi-colon    
                                               ;
                           The semi-colon is used to separate when the comma is not 
                           enough and the full stop is a more complete break than the sense 
                           demands.  Most commonly, it is used between closely related 
                           independent clauses:   
                           At one time the optical microscope was the principal tool of 
                           metallography; today, it is the scanning electron microscope.  
                           When conjunctive adverbs accordingly, also, hence, likewise, 
                           similarly… link clauses, they are proceeded by a semi-colon. It is 
                           used, too, to separate members of a list when the comma is not 
                           enough:  
                           The literature includes Gibson (1997), who studied simple 
                           compression; Olurin (1998), who studied the effect of holes and 
                           notches; Deshpande (1999), who…. 
                           7.4 The colon    
                                          :
                           The colon introduces part of a sentence that exemplifies, restates 
                           or explains the preceding parts. It is expectant:  it sets the reader 
                           up to anticipate elaboration. 
                           This raises the question: is the model right or wrong? 
                           There are two reasons for repeating this experiment: the first, to 
                           improve the precision; the second, to establish reproducibility.

                           7.5 The exclamation mark  ! 
                           The exclamation mark signals surprise, excitement, imperative, 
                           even contradiction; it turns up the volume. 
                                   Harte reports that metal foams sink in water. 
                           is a simple statement;  
                                   Harte reports that metal foams sink in water! 
                           implies that this is startling, perhaps even mistaken. Scientific 
                           writing does not need this sort of emphasis or innuendo. Delete it, 
                           and say what you want to say in a direct way. 
                           7.6 The question mark      
                                                  ?
                           The question mark is used after a direct question:  
                           Why was this work undertaken? The reason……. 
                           It is used to indicate uncertainty: Euclid, 450?  —374 BC. 
                           It is optional after a rhetorical question:  
                           Who would trust that model.                 
                           So what. 
                           7.7 The hyphen  - 
                           The hyphen connects part of a compound word: 
                            Well-known; half-expected; curiosity-provoking; a ball-and-stick 
                                                model.  
                           It is generally required when a noun is used as an adjective: a box-

                                       24         
                            girder; a bar-chart. Its most engaging property is its capacity to 
                            create new words and meanings by combinations both established 
                            and original: 
                            A Fleck-inspired interpretation; a shark-skin-textured surface.  
                            But treat this with caution; it can easily descend into stomach-
                            lurching purple-prosed absurdity. 
                            7.8 The dash        
                                          —
                            The dash sets off parenthetic material that results in a break in 
                            continuity in a sentence.   
                            Magnetic materials—carbon steels for instance—contain atoms with 
                            unpaired electron spins.” 
                            This conclusion—and it is a significant one—appears to violate the 
                            first law of thermodynamics.  
                            The remaining specimens—those which had not fractured—were 
                            sent for analysis. 
                            A dash can lead to an upshot, a final summary word or statement, 
                            and give emphasis: 
                            Cell-wall bending, cell-wall buckling and cell-wall fracture—are all 
                            equally probable.

                  7.9 The quotation mark “ ” 
                  Quotation marks enclose direct “word-for-word” quotations and 
                  dialogue.  
                   “Uncork the flagon; let the wine-cups flow.”—Horace, Odes, 27BC.  
                   “One small step for a man; one giant leap for mankind.”—Neil 
                  Armstrong, US astronaut (1969).   
                  Quotation marks are sometimes used to enclose an original, ironic 
                  or unusual turn-of-phrase:   
                  This research took a “try-it-and-see approach.”    
                  This colloquial phraseology is uncomfortable in scientific writing; 
                  avoid it.  
                  7.10 The apostrophe  ’ 
                  The apostrophe shows either possession or contraction; thus, the 
                  possessive forms: Sutcliffe’s theory;  everyone’s idea.   
                  There is no apostrophe in the possessive his, her or particularly, 
                  its.  
                  In contractions, the apostrophe indicates missing letters: Don’t, 
                  isn’t, it’s (meaning “it is”). Contractions of this sort are 
                  inappropriate in scientific writing, but can be acceptable in informal 
                  or popular writing, as here.  
                  7.11 Italics    
                         italics
                  Underline, embolden or italicise? All three attach emphasis and 
                  importance to a word or phrase. In contemporary scientific writing 
     How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                          26     
                           italics are preferred. Bold tends to be reserved for headings.  
                           Underlining can appear over-emphatic and, within a text, bold can 
                           seem authoritarian. Italics allow smooth definitions of terms:  
                           “The critical value of the fatigue limit, or fatigue threshold, is 
                           listed…”  
                           allows the italicised words to be used thereafter in place of the 
                           longer definition. Book titles are often italicised “The Theory of 
                           Shell Structures” by C.R.Calladine, as are words in foreign 
                           languages. To write more on this would be de trop. 
                           7.12 Parentheses          
                                             (   )
                           Parentheses—literally: putting-asides—embrace material of all 
                           sorts, and help structure scientific writing. But do not let them take 
                           over, clouding the meaning of the sentence with too many asides.  
                           Face-centred cubic metals (copper, silver, and gold, for instance) 
                           have nine independent elastic constants. 
                           Shercliff (1998) surveys the status of modeling in Material Sciences . 
                           It is plausible (although not everyone agrees) that this theory is 
                           correct. 
                           7.13 Brackets          
                                          [   ]
                           Brackets are used to indicate editorial comments or words inserted 
                           as explanation: [continued on p. 62], [see footnote].

                  8  DETAIL IV:  Style 
                  A good style lifts writing from that which is dull and ordinary to that 
                  which is distinguished, memorable, individual. There is no formula 
                  for instant style—it is partly a personal thing—but there are useful 
                  guidelines. Style is approached through plainness, simplicity, good 
                  structure and desire to convey information to the reader in the 
                  most accessible way.   
                   
                  8.1 Be clear 
                  The essence of technical writing is communication. The first 
                  quality, with precedence over all others, is clarity. Use simple 
                  language and simple, concise construction; short words rather 
                  than long; familiar words, not obscure. When you’ve said 
                  something, make sure that you’ve really said it. The writers of 
                  these headlines (all from newspapers in 1998) hadn’t: 
                  Red tape holds up new bridge. 
                  Something went wrong in jet crash, expert says. 
                  Chef throws heart in to help feed the hungry. 
                  Prostitutes appeal to Pope. 
                  Panda mating fails; vet takes over. 
                  These are funny because the intended meaning can be guessed.  
                  More often, it can’t; then the loss of clarity misleads and confuses. 
                  AND DON’T WAFFLE. Consider this, from a well-known Materials 
                  text:  
                  “The selection of the proper material is a key step in the design 
     How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                          28     
                  process because it is the crucial decision that links computer 
                  calculations and the lines on an engineering drawing with a real or 
                  working design”.   
                  What does it say? “Materials selection is important”, and we knew 
                  that already. It is wasting the reader’s time.   
                   
                  8.2 Write from an appropriate design 
                  Poor writing lacks order, mixes ideas that should develop 
                  separately, fails to progress in a logical sequence. The concept-
                  sheet gives structure: there is a place on it for each part of your 
                  story. In making it, decide where the bits will go, the logical order, 
                  the way they will fit together.   
                  Remember who you are writing for. Tell them what they want to 
                  know, not what they know already or do not want to know. 
                   
                  8.3 Define everything 
                  Define all symbols and abbreviations.   
                  The mass  m  scales as  E/ρ  where  E  is Youngs’s modulus and  ρ  
                  is the density… leaving a double space on either side of a symbol 
                  when it appears in the text. 
                  The measurements, made with a scanning electron microscope 
                  (SEM), …   
                  allows you to use the abbreviation SEM thereafter.

                            8.4 Avoid empty words 
                            Avoid clichés (standard formalised phrases): they are corpses 
                            devoid of the vitality which makes meaning spring from the page:   
                            The long and the short of it is that digital methods are the flavour of 
                            the month; the bottom line is that analog computation is old hat—
                            avoid it like the plague. 
                            Avoid weak qualifiers:  very, rather, somewhat, quite…  
                                                                   
                            This very important point …  makes less impact than: This important 
                            point … or, more simply:  This point …. 
                            The agreement with theory is quite good suggests that it is not. 
                            These ideas could rather easily be extended to the non-linear case … 
                            makes the reader wonder why you didn’t do it.  
                             
                            8.5 Revise and rewrite 
                            Revising is part of writing. Nobody gets it right first time; some go 
                            through 8 or 10 drafts. The most spontaneous-seeming prose is, 
                            often, the most rewritten. Do not be afraid to write the first draft 
                            with the simple aim of getting all the facts down on paper. You can 
                            then see what you’ve got, and can extract, revise, and distil a 
                            paper, a conference report or a research proposal from it, as 
                            needed. 
                             
                            8.6 Do not overstate, over emphasise or 
                            apologise
                                       
                            All of these undermine the reader’s confidence in your judgment.

                  8.7 Avoid being patronising, condescending or 
                  eccentric 
                  Write in a way that draws attention to the sense and substance or 
                  the writing, not to the mood or whimsical humour of the author.  If 
                  the writing is solid and good, the character of the author will 
                  emerge.  To achieve style, start by trying for none.

                  Hi! me again with some hot news about engineering at CUED, or Q’Ed 
                  as we call it. It’s been a helluva term for good stuff—we got more going 
                  on here than ever before…The author says nothing and is showing 
                  off, drawing attention to himself.

                           8.8 Use appropriate language 
                           Use standard symbols and terms. Calling Young’s modulus  G  will 
                           confuse, even after you’ve defined it.   
                           Minimise the use of acronyms and abbreviations. 
                           The MEM, analysed by FE methods, was photographed by SEM and

                           is bad writing. Find other ways of saying it, even if it takes more 
                           words. 
                           Avoid jargon. Jargon is the secret language of the field. It excludes 
                           the intelligent, otherwise well-informed, reader, and speaks only to 
                           the initiated. Some jargon is unavoidable—new concepts 
                           sometimes need new words. But don’t be tempted to use it to 
                           show that you are an insider. The Appendix has examples. 
                           And above all, remember who you are writing for. 
                            
                           8.9 Good first sentence 
                           Don’t start introductions (or anything else) with platitudes. Tell the 
                           reader something he does not already know. Openings such as: 
                                It is widely accepted that X (your topic) is important … 
                           has the reader yawning before you’ve started. Try to get a new 
                           fact, new idea or a revealing comparison into the first line.

                          theoretical models …  Comparison of the experiments with the 
                          models suggests that the measured strength are less than those 
                          predicted … 
                          The first sentences is a platitude; the second and third involve the 
                          reader in details, the relevance of which is not yet clear; only in the 
                          fourth does the point start to emerge. 
                           
                          Better: Metal foams are not as strong as they should be. Models, 
                          which describe polymer foams well, overestimate the strength of 
                          metal foams by factor of 2 to 5. This research explores the reasons. 
                          To be more specific… (details of literature X, Y, Z, P, Q, R here). 
                          The first two sentences now highlight the problem. The third says 
                          what the paper is going to do. The details that follow then have 
                          relevance. 
                          Use a quotation only if it is spot-on; inappropriate quotations give 
                          the impression that the writer is trying too hard. 
                              “God created solids, but the Devil created surfaces”—anon. 
                          could be a good first line for a review-article on friction and wear, 
                          but it is pretentious as an opening to a paper on (say) the wear of 
                          bronze journal bearings. If you do use a quotation, make sure you 
                          get it right —see Quotations, in Further Reading. 
                           
                          8.10 Seek helpful examples and analogies 
                          Ferro-magnetic material—steels, for example—can be shock-loaded 
        How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                                      33         
                  by pulsed magnetic fields.   
                  The example of steels makes the generalisation concrete.   
                  One cause of rolling friction is material damping. A rolling ball 
                  deforms the surface on which it rolls. If the work done in this 
                  deformation is lost through damping, a frictional force opposes 
                  motion. It is like riding a bicycle through sand: the rubbing sand 
                  particles dissipate energy much as atom or molecular 
                  rearrangements do. 
                  The bicycle analogy is appropriate; it relates the scientific problem 
                  to one which is familiar.  
                  There are more examples of analogies in the Appendix. 
                   
                  8.11 Linking sentences 
                  Each sentence in a paragraph should lead logically to the next. 
                  When you read a paragraph, where does it jar? Why did you have 
                  to pause or re-read? What word-change will fix it? Edit for 
                  readability. 
                  It helps the reader if one paragraph ends with a device that links it 
                  to the next: a word or phrase picked up in the first sentence of the 
                  following paragraph, or a statement of what is coming next (though 
                  be sparing with this, it can get tedious). 
                  ………To progress further, we need a way to rank the materials—a 
                  material index. 
     How to write a paper, 6th edition                                                                                      MFA, 20/02/05 
                          34     
                  A material index is a …… 
                  The repeated words link the two paragraphs. 
                  ………..This behaviour suggests that the process is diffusion-
                  controlled.  A model based on this idea is developed next. 
                  The stresses at grain boundaries can be relaxed by diffusion. … 
                  The reader knows what the second paragraph is about before 
                  reading it. 
                   
                  8.12 Observe good writing 
                  When you read a good opening, an apt analogy, an illuminating 
                  example, or an idea well expressed, re-read it. Don’t try to imitate 
                  it directly, but observe how the author did it. Bit by bit you can 
                  absorb the techniques. 
                   
                  8.13 Finally… 
                  Style takes its final shape from an attitude of mind, not from 
                  principles of composition. Focus on clarity. Make sure you’ve said 
                  what you think you’ve said.  And remember who your readers are; 
                  seek to express your results and ideas in ways they will most 
                  easily grasp.

                          Good Abstract 
                           
                          Temography of Shear Bands in Metal Foams 
                           
                          Metal foams, when compressed, deform by shear banding; the bands 
                          broaden as deformation progresses. We have studied the nucleation 
                          and broadening of shear bands by laser-speckle strain-mapping. The 
                          foams were non-homogeneous, with spatial variations of density of a 
                          factor of 2; the shear bands nucleate in the low-density zones, and 
                          broaden into the high-density regions as strain progresses. The 
                          results indicate that processing to minimise the density fluctuations 
                          could increase the initial compressive yield strength of the foams, 
                          when shear bands first form, by a factor of 1.5. 
                          This, in four sentences and 94 words, gives a clear, concise 
                          portrait of the paper, devoid of unnecessary detail and secondary 
                          information.

                  Good analogy (1) 
                   
                  Structured Programming 
                  ‘Music, poetry, and programming, all three as symbolic constructs of 
                  the human brain, are found to be naturally structured into 
                  hierarchies which have many different nested levels.  Sounds form 
                  meaningful units, which in turn form words; words group into 
                  phrases, which group into sentences; sentences make paragraphs and 
                  these are organised into higher levels of meaning. Notes form musical 
                  phrases, which form themes, counterpoints, harmonies etc; which 
                  form movements, which form concertos symphonies and so on. 
                  Structure in programs is equally hierarchical, if not so universally 
                  recognised….’

                           The analogy is a little long-winded, but it achieves the writers’ 
                           aims: to convey the importance of structure in programming, and , 
                           by association, to portray programming as an art-form and to 
                           elevate its stature as an intellectual activity.

                           The Character of a Volvo 
                           ‘Volvos have a certain character.  Purchasers see them as solid, safe, 
                           long-lasting, reliably masculine, with built-in Scandinavian qualities

                     Extract from the Introduction to ASM Metals Handbook vol. 20, ASM 
                     International (1998) Metals Park, Ohio, USA 
                     There is a warning here for us all. What they wanted to say is: 
                     “Engineers need to choose materials and to find processes to 
                     shape and join them. This ASM Handbook is designed to help 
                     them.” 
                     But that sounds too short, too plain, not grand enough. The fear of 
                     sounding trivial, of not being sufficiently heavyweight, haunts all 
                     writers when they are asked to write for audiences with whom they 
                     are unfamiliar. The temptation is to use long words, to sound 
                     sophisticated, to get fancy; and the effect is to dilute the message 
                     until its true flavour is lost.  I have been just as guilty of it as 
                     anyone else. Don’t do it.  Say what you mean to say and say it 
                     clearly and simply. 
                     Remember who your readers are. 
                      
                     The Act of Design 
                     ‘Designing is a creative activity that calls for a sound grounding in 
                     mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, thermodynamics, 
                     hydrodynamics, electro-engineering, production engineering, 
                     materials technology and design theory, together with practical 
                     knowledge and experience in specialist fields.  Initiative, resolution,

                               42       
                     qualities that will stand designers in good stead and are 
                     indispensable to those in responsible positions.’ 
                     From a distinguished book on Engineering Design 
                     How many people do you know who could meet that job 
                     description? The authors wish to convey the idea that design is an 
                     inter-disciplinary activity, and one that has technical, managerial, 
                     and social facets, but they have done so in a way that intimidates. 
                     They have lost touch with their readers. An alternative with the 
                     same message might be: 
                     Designers cannot be expected to know everything, yet there are times 
                     when it might seem that they must.  Design involves an exceptionally 
                     broad base of technical competence and practical experience, 
                     leadership, teamwork and management skills.   
                     Try not to alienate your readers. Phrase your message with them 
                     in mind.

                     This sort of stuff is rife in critiques of music and art, and in writing 
                     on Psychiatry, Psychology and Sociology. It surfaces, too, in 
                     books on Industrial Design, and, less frequently, in scientific and 
                     technical writing. Don’t let the jargon-bug infect your own style. 
                      
                     Jargon (2) 
                      
                     The justification for a travel grant 
                     My mathematical work is in the area of Symplectic Geometry and 
                     Differential Equations, in particular on a geometrical interpretation 
                     of the Painlevé equations.  I have succeeded in attacking the 
                     Isomonodromical Deformation problem for higher order 
                     singularities by symplectic means.  On the one hand, this involves a 
                     symplectic structure obtained from infinite-dimensional 
                     considerations and on the other an analysis of the geometry of the 
                     Stokes matrices in the language of Poisson Lie groups. 
                     From a students application for a travel grant (1999) 
                     There’s nothing wrong with the grammar, punctuation or spelling 
                     here —all are fine. But how much does the statement convey to 
                     the panel awarding the travel grant, all of them scientists or 
                     engineers, but none specialists in this sort of mathematics? 
                     Practically nothing. The meaning is hidden in the jargon; the writer 
                     has made no attempt to translate his ideas into a language the rest 
                     of the world can understand. It is not always easy to do so—the 
                     subject of Symplectic Geometry may be a difficult one to illustrate 
                     with simple examples or analogies—but it is always worth trying.
