                 Intro 
                 The  first  several  pages  will  attempt  to  describe  the  design  in  everyday 
                 language, keeping numbers to a minimum and avoiding formulas and jargon. I 
                 apologize in advance for my loose use of language and imperfect analogies.  
                 The second section is for those with a technical background. There are no 
                 doubt errors of various kinds and superior optimizations for elements of the 
                 system.   Feedback    would    be   most    welcome    –   please   send   to 
                 hyperloop@spacex.com or hyperloop@teslamotors.com. I would like to thank 
                 my  excellent  compadres  at  both  companies  for  their  help  in  putting  this 
                 together. 
                 Background 
                 When the California “high speed” rail was approved, I was quite disappointed, 
                 as I know many others were too. How could it be that the home of Silicon 
                 Valley and JPL – doing incredible things like indexing all the world’s knowledge 
                 and putting rovers on Mars – would build a bullet train that is both one of the 
                 most  expensive  per  mile  and  one  of  the  slowest  in  the  world?  Note,  I  am
