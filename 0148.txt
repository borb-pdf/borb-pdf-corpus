              Robert J. Gordon is Stanley G. Harris Professor in the Social Sciences and Professor of Economics at Northwestern 
              University. He is one of the world's leading experts on inlfation, unemployment, and productivity growth. His recent 
              work on the rise and fall of the New Economy, the revival and “explosion” of U. S. productivity growth, the stalling 
              of European productivity growth, and the widening of the U. S. income distribution, have been widely cited. Gordon 
              did his undergraduate work at Harvard and then attended Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship. He received 
              his Ph.D. in 1967 at M.I.T. and taught at Harvard and the University of Chicago before coming to Northwestern in 
              1973. He is a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a Research Fellow of the Centre for 
              Economic Policy Research (London) and the Observatoire Français des Conjunctures Economiques (OFCE, Paris), 
              and member of four U. S. government academic advisory committees.
         63    The Centre for Economic Policy Research, founded in 1983, is a network of over 800 researchers based mainly 
        .
               in universities throughout Europe, who collaborate through the Centre in research and its dissemination. The Centre’s 
               goal is to promote research excellence and policy relevance in European economics. Because it draws on such a large 
               network of researchers, CEPR is able to produce a wide range of research which not only addresses key policy issues, 
               but also relfects a broad spectrum of individual viewpoints and perspectives. CEPR has made key contributions to a 
               wide range of European and global policy issues for almost three decades. CEPR research may include views on policy, 
               but the Executive Committee of the Centre does not give prior review to its publications, and the Centre takes no 
               institutional policy positions. The opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and not necessarily those 
               of the Centre for Economic Policy Research.
