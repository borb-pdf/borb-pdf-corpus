                        If you end up in Turkish Territory
        If you are pushed back to Turkey or arrested by the Turkish coast guard you 
        can be detained in a detention camp in Turkey for some days (the duration of 
        detention varies but it is usually short). The period of detention depends lar-
        gely on if you have been arrested before by the Turkish authorities and also 
        if you have registered for asylum or not. It also depends on the place where 
        you are detained. There have been cases in which Turkish coast guards did 
        not transfer people to detention centres but set them free instead. If you are 
        in detention, you can seek legal help here: Multeci Der in Izmir, Turkey (+90 
        232 483 54 21) or Helsinki People Assembly in Istanbul (+90 212 292 68 42 or 
        +90 212 292 68 43).
                 Report any deaths or violations of your rights
        If people died or went missing from your boat, or if you have lost family 
        members and want to trace them, you have to report it to the authorities that 
        arrested you, as well as the Red Cross in Athens (+30 210 8259002) and the 
        UNHCR (+30 2106726462/3). 
        If you were in distress and a boat failed to fulifl its duty to rescue you while 
        aware of your situation or if you have been pushed back by the Greek Coast 
        Guard or international border police from Greek waters/ land to Turkey write 
        to: contact@w2eu.info or info@watchmed.net

        so that these situations do not repeat themselves. Try to give as many details 
        as you can, and send us any picture or video of the crossing. Your identity will
