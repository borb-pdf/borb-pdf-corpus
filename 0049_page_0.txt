                  Lichen Sclerosus in Women 
                              
                              
      What is lichen sclerosus?  
       
      Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition which can affect 
      any part of the skin, but in females it most often affects the vulval skin and 
      the skin around the anus. It can start in childhood or adulthood and affect 
      girls or women of any age.  
       
      What causes lichen sclerosus?  
       
      The cause of lichen sclerosus is not fully understood. It is felt to be a type 
      of autoimmune condition in which the person’s immune system reacts 
      against the skin for no obvious reason.  
       
      Lichen sclerosus is not due to an infection – the disease is not contagious, 
      so sexual partners cannot pick it up.  
       
      Friction or damage to the skin can bring out lichen sclerosus and make it 
      worse.  
       
      Is lichen sclerosus hereditary?  
       
      Rarely, lichen sclerosus can occur in relatives.  
       
      What are the symptoms of lichen sclerosus?  
       
      Many patients have none, but the most common symptom of lichen 
      sclerosus is itching. As a rule the patches on the general skin surface 
      seldom itch much, but those in the genital area do, and can also be sore if 
      the skin breaks down or cracks. In the genital area, the scar-like process 
      can tighten the skin, and this can interfere with urination and with sexual 
                             1
