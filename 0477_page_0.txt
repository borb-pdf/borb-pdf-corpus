                        Abstract. The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its
                        utility through a number of projects, with Bitcoin being one of the most notable ones. Each such project can be seen as
                        a simple application on a decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional
                        singleton machine with shared-state.
                           Ethereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources,
                        each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others.
                        Wediscuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage.

               to trust one another. This may be due to geographical           used to keep peer-to-peer ﬁle trading in check, providing
