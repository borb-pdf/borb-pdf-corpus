       Conclusion 
        
       As stated earlier, the purpose of this document is to catalog the electronic invoice technical standards 
       used by U.S. businesses. Businesses have many different options and considerations they must choose 
       from in order to send and receive electronic invoices. Compounding the challenge are the many 
       different invoice technical standards that exist in the U.S. market. This results in in interoperability 
       issues to integrate with their trading partners to transmit and receive electronic invoices. To address 
       these issues will require a broad, coordinated effort among the many market participants. This 
       document helps lay the foundation to select an invoice standard for the U.S. market to accelerate the 
       adoption of electronic invoicing. The catalyst to do this will be the continuation of the Business 
       Payments Coalition E-Invoicing Work Group.  
       Next Steps 
        
       The Business Coalition E-Invoicing Work Group will re-convene in November 2017 and begin the work to 
       define an invoice technical standard and interoperability framework for the U.S. market in order to 
       accelerate the adoption of electronic invoices for all sizes of businesses while not disrupting current 
       implementations.

               Buyer Direct Model – Buyer require sellers to send invoices directly to an e-invoicing / invoice 
               management system. 
               EDI (VAN) Providers - Provide a network where EDI documents can be exchanged between business 
               partners typically through a mailbox service. The EDI provider connects the seller and buyer together to 
               enable the exchange of documents through the network.  
               Interoperability – Refers to the ability for computer programs to exchange data via a common set of 
               formats, to read and write the same file format, and to use the same protocols. 
               E-Invoice Providers – Provide a network where electronic invoices can be exchanged between business 
               partners, regardless of formats. The E-Invoice provider will map the incoming invoice file from the seller 
               and map the outgoing invoice file to the buyer. This process allows for the exchange of the invoice 
               across multiple sellers and buyers without the need to integrate directly with one another.

        E-Invoice Portal Provider – Portal solution that a buyer or seller implements to enable sending or 
        retrieving invoices. Portals can also be built in house by the buyer or seller, which directly integrates into 
        their back office processes. 
        Format – Refers to the layout of the data. When a file is received by a computer program, the program 
        accepts the data as a input in a specific way, reads and processes the file, and provides an output that is 
        similar or an another format. 
        Network Model – Buyers and sellers interact through a network provider. Network provider 
        functionality frequently adds accounts payable and accounts receivable automation, including work 
        flow, approval, payment and ERP integration. 
        Scan & Capture Provider – Provider who recognizes key data fields on an invoice and reads the 
        information into a structured data file. Invoices can be received in multiple formats such as PDFs, 
        Scanned Images, and Emails).The file can then be fed into the accounts payable system for processing. 
        Seller Direct Model – Sellers distribute invoices via email, portal, or e-invoice to a buyer. 
        Semantics – Refers to the meaning of an instruction. For example, if you misspell the word “Enter”, it is 
        a syntax error. If the command is legal, however, it does not make any sense in the current context, it’s a 
        semantics error.  
        Syntax – Refers to the spelling and grammar of programing languages. Each program language defines 
        its own syntactical rules that control which words the computer understands, which combination of 
        words are meaningful, and which punctuation is necessary to be correctly structured document.
