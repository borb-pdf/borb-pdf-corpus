                              Wetrained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a sin-
                              gle front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach
                              proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the sys-
                              tem learns to drive in trafﬁc on local roads with or without lane markings and on
                              highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking
                              lots and on unpaved roads.

                              We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA
                              DRIVETMPX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining
                              where to drive. The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).
