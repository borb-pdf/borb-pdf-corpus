                    If your invoice is received directly by the Procurement Office (via Email or hardcopy) the Procurement Office 
                    will process the invoice through our Electronic Invoice Capture System.  This system will complete the Invoice 
                    detail and itemization Summary information with as much information as it can obtain from the invoice.  The 
                    Procurement Office will then assign the invoice to the correct invoice owner. The Invoice Owner will review the 
                    information, add additional information as required, and submit the request for department and University 
                    approval. The owner can also forward it to another Invoice Owner if needed or send back to the Procurement 
                    Office if changes are required.  Once the Invoice Owner submits the request, it will flow through the Index 
                    Approval route for approval.
