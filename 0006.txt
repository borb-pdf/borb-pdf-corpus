            1. Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding   
            This optional Article will be inserted into the GA if the action is implemented with beneficiaries that 
            do not receive EU funding. 
                    Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding — They participate in the action as beneficiaries, but NOT with 
                 EU funding. They must carry out the work under the action and comply with the GA (although not with all its 
                 obligations; the financial obligations and some IPR obligations do not apply for them).  
                  
                  
            ‘Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding’ are either: 
                   ‘beneficiaries not eligible for funding’, i.e. beneficiaries which:  
                           are NOT from an EU Member State, H2020 associated country or third country 
                            listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work Programme AND 
                           were NOT granted exceptional EU funding by the Commission/Agency (during the 
                            selection procedure) 
                                  For  more  information  on  third  country  participants,  see  the  Funding  &  Tenders  Portal 
                              Online Manual (international cooperation). 
                           Beneficiaries that (exceptionally) become eligible for funding during the action, may in principle 
                       request funding (as from their eligibility), if the grant agreement is amended to change Articles 9, 57 
                       and Annex 2 (see Article 55).   
                       Since the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased (see Article 5.1), this would only be possible 
                       if  the  consortium  reshuffles  the  estimated  budget  in  order  to  free  funding  for  the  beneficiary 
                       concerned. 
                       Moreover, costs incurred before the amendment would be eligible ONLY as from the date of eligibility 
                       for funding and if they comply with all the obligations under the GA (e.g. for actual personnel costs  
                       must be supported by time records in accordance with Article 18). 
                        
                        
                   ‘beneficiaries requesting zero funding’, i.e. beneficiaries that are eligible for funding, but 
                        
                    decided not to request any funding. 
                        
                        
                           Beneficiaries requesting zero funding may in principle request funding later on, if the GA is 
                       amended  (to change Article 9 and Annex 2; see Article 55). 
                        
                       Since the maximum grant amount will NOT be increased (see Article 5.1), this would only be possible 
                       if  the  consortium  reshuffles  the  estimated  budget  in  order  to  free  funding  for  the  beneficiary 
                        
                       concerned. 
                           . 
                       Moreover, costs incurred before the amendment would be eligible ONLY if they comply with all the 
                       obligations under the GA retroactively (e.g. for actual personnel costs  must be supported by time 
                            
                       records in accordance with Article 18).

                           The beneficiaries must make such purchases ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
                           lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
                           [OPTION: In addition, if the value of the purchase exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries must comply with 
                             the following rules: […]23]

                           and  the  European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also

                           10.2                Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If  a  beneficiary  breaches  any  of  its  obligations  under  Article  10.1.1,  the  costs  related  to  the  contract 
                             concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 10.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
                           43). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
                            
                             23       If  the  authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality, taking into 
                                      account the value of the contracts and the relative size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. 
                                      Specific rules must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable 
                                      provisions should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000. The 
                                      authorising officer may set a threshold higher than EUR 60 000 on the basis of a risk assessment.

                        2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Best value for money or lowest price  
                                 
                        The beneficiaries must base their purchases either on the best value for money (considering the 
                                 
                        quality of the service, good or work proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest 
                        price.  
                            
                                This requirement reflects the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii) 
                                (i.e.  that  costs  must  be  reasonable  and  comply  with  the  principle  of  sound  financial 
                                management) and applies it specifically to the purchasing context.  
                                The best value for money principle does NOT in all cases require  competitive selection 
                                procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must demonstrate how 
                                best value for money was ensured. 
                                For the best price-quality ratio, price is an essential aspect (together with quality criteria, such 
                                as technical quality, etc.), but it is NOT automatically necessary to select the offer with the 
                                lowest price. Selecting the lowest price may however be appropriate for automatic award 
                                procedures where the contract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and 
                                quotes the lowest price. 
                                         Example: electronic tendering for consumables 
                                         In order to provide a good analysis of the price-quality ratio, the criteria defining quality 
                                         must be clear and coherent with the purposes of the purchase. 
                        Occasionally (and only for contracts with a value higher than EUR 60 000) the Commission/Agency 
                        may set out additional conditions (in view of the possible financial risks, taking into account the 
                        size  of  the  contract  and  the  grant  amount).  These  conditions  must  be  described  in  the  work 
                        programme/call — as special eligibility conditions for the purchase costs — and be based on the 
                        rules which the European Commission applies for its own procurement contracts. 
                                Examples (additional conditions): minimum number of offers received; publication in the Official Journal or 
                                in specific media such as internet, national newspapers, etc. 
                         
                        3.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Controls  on  the  contractor  (by  the 
                              Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
                        The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                        and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
                        investigations on the contractor (see Article 22). 
                        They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
                        impact of the action under Article 23.  
                        It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
                        contractor  (for  example,  if  they  refuse  access  and  the  Commission/Agency  cannot  verify  the 
                        eligibility of the costs, it will reject them).

                  Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ (within the meaning of the 
                                                                                                                               34
                  EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU  must moreover comply with the 
                  applicable  national  law  on  public  procurement.  These  rules  normally  provide  for  special 
                  procurement procedures, for the types of contracts they cover.  
                           ‘Contracting authority’ means the State, regional or local authorities, bodies governed by 
                           public law, associations formed by one or several of such authorities or one or several of such 
                           bodies governed by public law (see Article 2.1(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU). 
                                       ‘Bodies governed by public law’ also include entities financed mostly by the State, 
                                       regional  or  local  authorities,  or  other  bodies  governed  by  public  law  and  entities 
                                       controlled by those bodies (for the full definition, see Article 2.1(4) of that Directive). 
                           ‘Contracting entities’ means entities operating in a utilities sector (water, energy, transport, 
                           postal  services).  They  may  be  contracting  authorities,  public  undertakings  or  entities 
                           operating on the basis of special or exclusive rights (for the full definition, see Article 4 of 
                           Directive 2014/25/EU). 
                   
                  Specific cases (purchases): 
                  Purchases between beneficiaries — Are in principle not accepted. If a beneficiary needs supplies 
                  from another beneficiary, it is the latter beneficiary that should charge them to the action. (Otherwise 
                  there  is  the  risk  that  the  grant  is  used  to  charge  commercial  profit  margins.)  Purchases  between 
                  beneficiaries will only be accepted in exceptional and properly justified cases (e.g. beneficiary A is the 
                  usual supplier of beneficiary B for a generic consumable that beneficiary B needs for the action).  
                  Framework contracts or subcontracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if 
                  this  is  the  usual  practice  of  the  beneficiary  (e.g.  for  a  type  of  goods).  In  order  to  be  eligible,  the 
                  framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money and absence of 
                  conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily have to be concluded before the start 
                  of the action.

                           11.1               Rules for the use of in-kind contributions against payment 
                           If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions provided by third 
                             parties against payment. 
                          
                             The beneficiaries may declare costs related to the payment of in-kind contributions as eligible (see 
                           Article  6.1  and  6.2),  up  to  the  third  parties’  costs  for  the  seconded  persons,  contributed  equipment, 
                           infrastructure or other assets or other contributed goods and services. 
                           The third parties and their contributions must be set out in Annex 1. The [Commission][Agency] may 
                             however approve in-kind contributions not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55), if: 
                                      -       they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and  
                                     -        their use does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision 
                                              awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                             and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also 
                           towards the third parties.  
                           11.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the costs related to the payment of the in-
                           kind contribution will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 6. 
                             Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                              
                                            
                         1. In-kind contributions by third parties against payment 
                         If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions provided by 
                         third parties against payment. 
                                     A ‘third party’ can be any legal entity that has not signed the GA (see Article 1).  
                                     This Article refers to in-kind contributions (i.e. non-financial resources of third parties put at 
                                     the beneficiaries’ disposal) that beneficiaries receive against payment. In this case, the 
                                     beneficiary makes a payment and therefore incurs a cost. 
                                                   Example (in-kind contributions  against  payment):  medical  equipment  provided  by  a  hospital 
                                                   (against a fee) to a university in order to carry out research 
                                     Both this Article and Article 12 only refer to in-kind contributions; they do NOT concern the 
                                     case of linked third parties carrying out part of the action tasks described in Annex 1 (see 
                                     Article 14). 
                          
                                   Article 11 contains additional cost eligibility conditions.

                  2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Costs of the payment to the third party, up 
                       to the third parties’ costs 
                  The beneficiaries may declare their costs for paying the in-kind contribution (e.g. the invoice from 
                  the third party), but only up to the costs incurred by the third party — if the other eligibility 
                  conditions  are  fulfilled  (see  in  particular  Article  6.1  and  6.2;  e.g.  necessary  for  the  action, 
                  recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary, etc.).  
                  If  the  amount paid by the beneficiary is lower than the cost incurred by the third party, the 
                  beneficiary may in addition declare the difference as in-kind contributions free of charge (see 
                  Article 12). If it decides to do so, it may have to declare that difference also as receipt (see Article 
                  5.3.3). 
                  For the upper limit (third party’s costs), normally only the direct costs actually incurred by the 
                  third party will be taken into account. 
                         The following costs may however be quantified using unit costs (to ensure similar costing as

                                    for SME owner costs: hourly rate fixed by Commission Decision C(2013) 8197  (see 
                                     Article 6.2.A.4) 
                                    for internally invoiced goods and services: unit cost on the basis of usual accounting 
                                     practices (see Article 6.2.D.5) 
                                    for unit costs for clinical studies: unit cost fixed in the GA (alternative to actual costs; 
                                     see Article 6.2.F). 
                         The actual costs must be identifiable and verifiable in the third party’s accounts. 
                         The indirect costs of the third party are either: 
                                      NOT  taken  into  account:  if  the  resources  (in-kind  contribution)  are  used  on  the 
                                       beneficiary’s premises  
                                or 
                                      taken  into  account:  if  the  in-kind  contributions  are  NOT  used  on  the  beneficiary’s 
                                       premises (but, for instance, on the third party’s premises). 
                                       In this case, the direct costs actually incurred by the third party may be increased by a 
                                       flat-rate of 25% on those costs. 
                               Example (no indirect costs of the third party accepted):  
                               A researcher is seconded to a beneficiary by a legal entity. This researcher works for the beneficiary on its 
                               premises. The third party charges the researcher’s direct costs (salary and related social security charges of 
                               EUR 50 000) and is reimbursed by the beneficiary. 
                               Additionally, the beneficiary has eligible direct costs of EUR 200 000. 
                               The third party’s direct costs equal EUR 50 000.  
                               Total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary are: 
                                      -     total eligible direct costs: EUR 200 000 (direct costs of beneficiary) + EUR 50 000 ( up to the 
                                            amount of third party’s direct costs) = EUR 250 000 
                                      -     eligible indirect costs; 25%* EUR 250 000 = EUR 62 500. No work was subcontracted, and no 
                                            financial support by third parties was given. 
                               TOTAL eligible costs declared by the beneficiary: EUR 250 000 + EUR 62 500 = EUR 312 500 
                               Example (direct costs of third party plus a 25% flat-rate for indirect costs):

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                    A legal entity makes available to a beneficiary the use of an installation or specialised piece of infrastructure 
                    that the beneficiary needs for the action. The third party charges the full direct and indirect costs of this and 
                    is reimbursed by the beneficiary.  
                    The costs of the third party equal EUR 20 000 of actual direct costs plus EUR 8 000 of actual indirect costs. 
                    This is a cost for the beneficiary, which may declare it for the action. However, since in H2020 actions 
                    indirect costs are reimbursed on the basis of a flat-rate of 25% of the direct eligible costs (calculated as 
                    indicated in Article 6.2.E of the GA), the beneficiary will declare as eligible costs for in-kind contributions 
                    against payment only EUR 20 000 (payment of third party’s direct costs) + EUR 5 000 for (cap for payment 
                    of third party’s indirect costs) (flat-rate of 25% of 20 000) = EUR 25 000.  
                    Additionally, the beneficiary has got eligible direct costs of EUR 200 000. 
                    Total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary are: 
                        -   total eligible direct costs: EUR 200 000 (direct costs of the beneficiary)+ EUR 25 000 (eligible costs 
                            of in-kind contributions against payment) = EUR 225 000 
                        -   eligible indirect costs: EUR 50 000= 25%* EUR 200 000 (direct costs of the beneficiary, excluding 
                            costs  of  in-kind  contributions  not  used  in  its  premises).  No  work  was  subcontracted,  and  no 
                            financial support by third parties was given. 
                    TOTAL eligible costs declared by the beneficiary: EUR 225 000 + EUR 50 000 = EUR 275 000. 
            If an audit shows that the costs declared by the beneficiary are higher than those incurred by the 
            third party, the difference will be rejected as ineligible (even if they correspond to the amount 
            actually paid by the beneficiary).  
             
            3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Third parties and their contributions be set 
               out in Annex 1 — Simplified approval procedure 
            The third parties, their in-kind contributions (i.e. non-financial resources) and an estimation of 
            the costs budgeted for the in-kind contributions must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA.  
            If the in-kind contributions are NOT used on the beneficiary’s premises, their estimated costs must 
            be also set out in Annex 2 (additional information column). 
            New in-kind contributions — If the need for third parties’ in-kind contributions was not known 
            at the moment of the signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendment of the 
            GA in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 55). Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency 
            may approve costs  related  to  in-kind  contributions  not  included  in  Annex  1  without  formally 
            amending the GA (simplified approval procedure). 
                    Example (approval): A new researcher is brought into a team working during the action’s second year of 
                    implementation. The beneficiary fails to inform the coordinator of the fact that this researcher is seconded 
                    from a public research centre to the beneficiary (a university), and therefore the GA is not amended (to 
                    include this in Annex 1). These circumstances are explained and justified in the technical report which 
                    includes the work carried out by this researcher. 
                Approval  will  NOT  be  granted  if  the  in-kind  contribution  risks  to  substantially  change  the 
                nature of the project (i.e. there is doubt whether the project is still (in substance) the same as 
                the one that was selected or whether the beneficiary has still the operational capacity to carry 
                out the action).  
                    Example (no approval): A proposal includes a beneficiary owning a prestigious laboratory and employing 
                    a specialised team of technicians in the field of the call. The proposal is selected after evaluation, taking into 
                    account the value provided by the involvement of this laboratory in the action. The GA is signed, but then 
                    the beneficiary decides to carry out the tests in another laboratory of a third party, without informing the 
                    Commission and amending the GA.  
             
                      The approval is at the discretion of the Commission/Agency and there is no automatic entitlement to it. 
                  Beneficiaries that rely on the simplified approval procedure bear the full risk of non-approval and rejection 
                  of costs by the Commission/Agency.

            4.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Controls  on  the  third  parties  (by  the 
               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits, 
            and investigations on the third parties (see Article 22), and in particular audit their underlying 
            costs.  
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23. 
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the third 
            parties (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility 
            of the costs, it will reject them). 
             
            Specific cases (in-kind contributions): 
            Foundations, spin-off companies, etc., created in order to manage the administrative tasks of 
            the beneficiary and which are paid directly by the coordinator — These are typically legal entities 
            (third parties) created or controlled by the beneficiary (usually a public body like a university/ministry) 
            which  handle  the  financial  and  administrative  aspects  of  the  beneficiaries’  involvement  in  research 
            projects.  
                Their tasks may include, among others, the employment of personnel, purchase of equipment or 
                consumables that the third party puts at disposal of the beneficiary to carry out the work of the 
                project.  
                Sometimes they also include the handling of the EU contribution (which means that the beneficiary 
                will use the bank account of the third party and that all payments made to that account count for 
                the beneficiary).  
            The contributions made by these entities are usually qualified as in-kind contributions against payment. 
            If the costs for the services are not recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary (e.g. there is no invoice 
            from the entity): 
                   the  beneficiary  has  to  prove  that  such  practice  is  in  line  with  national  law  and  applicable 
                    accounting standards 
                   the costs must be recorded in the accounts of the third party.

                           ARTICLE 12 — USE OF IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES FREE 
                                                                      OF CHARGE 
                           12.1               Rules for the use of in-kind contributions free of charge 
                           If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions provided by third 
                            parties free of charge.  
                          
                            The beneficiaries may declare costs incurred by the third parties for the seconded persons, contributed 
                           equipment, infrastructure or other assets or other contributed goods and services as eligible in accordance 
                           with Article 6.4. 
                           The third parties and their contributions must be set out in Annex 1. The [Commission][Agency] may 
                            however approve in-kind contributions not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55), if: 
                                     -        they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and 
                                     -        their use  does not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision 
                                              awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also 
                           towards the third parties. 
                           12.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the costs incurred by the third parties 
                           related to the in-kind contribution will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
                          
                                            
                         1. In-kind contributions by third parties free of charge 
                         If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may use in-kind contributions provided 
                         by third parties free of charge. 
                                  This Article refers to the case where a third party makes available some of its resources to a 
                                  beneficiary, for free (i.e. without any payment, contrary to the case covered by Article 11). In 
                                  this case, the beneficiary itself makes no payment and there is therefore NO cost incurred by 
                                  the beneficiary. However, the GA provides that it may charge the costs incurred by the third 
                                  party for its in-kind contribution (see also Article 6.4). 
                                  Examples (in-kind contributions free of charge):  
                                  Civil  servant  working  as  a  professor  in  a  public  university.  His  salary  is  paid  not  by  the  beneficiary  (the 
                                  university) but by the government (the ministry). The beneficiary will declare these salary costs in its individual 
                                  financial statements, even if they are paid by a third party (the ministry/government).  
                          
                                    Article 12 contains additional cost eligibility conditions.

                  The beneficiaries  may  declare  the  costs  of  the  third  party  for  the  in-kind  contribution,  if  the 
                  eligibility conditions set out in Article 12.1 and in Article 6.4 are fulfilled (e.g. actually incurred by 
                  the third party, necessary for the action, incurred during the action duration, etc.). 
                  The costs must be recorded in the accounts of the third party.  
                  Normally, only the direct costs actually incurred by the third party may be declared.  
                         The following  costs  may  however  (alternatively)  be  quantified  using  unit  costs  (to  ensure 
                         similar costing as for charging costs under the GA): 
                                    for  personnel  costs:  hourly  rate  on  the  basis  of  usual  costs  accounting  practices 
                                     (alternative to actual costs; see Article 6.2.A.1) 
                                                                                                                                                                                36
                                    for SME owner costs: hourly rate fixed by Commission Decision C(2013) 8197  (see 
                                     Article 6.2.A.4) 
                                    for internally invoiced goods and services: unit cost on the basis of usual accounting 
                                     practices (see Article 6.2.D.5) 
                                    for unit costs for clinical studies: unit cost fixed in the GA (alternative to actual costs; 
                                     see Article 6.2.F). 
                          The indirect costs of the third party are either: 
                                      NOT  taken  into  account:  if  the  resources  (in-kind  contribution)  are  used  in  the 
                                       beneficiary’s premises 
                                 or 
                                      taken into account: if the in-kind contributions are used on the third party’s premises. 
                                       In this case, the direct costs actually incurred by the third party may be increased by 
                                       a flat-rate of 25% on those costs; but the beneficiary may NOT include them a second 
                                       time to calculate its own indirect costs. 
                  Free of charge in-kind contributions may also have to be declared as receipts (see Article 5.3.3(c)) 
                  — capped by the amount declared as third party costs for the contribution. 
                  If an audit shows that the direct costs declared by the beneficiary are higher than those incurred 
                  by the third party, the difference will be rejected as ineligible.  
                   
                  3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Third parties and their contributions set out 
                       in Annex 1 — Simplified approval procedure 
                  The third parties, their in-kind contributions and an estimation of the costs budgeted for the 
                  in-kind contributions must be mentioned in Annex 1 of the GA.  
                  If the in-kind contributions are NOT used on the beneficiary’s premises, their estimated costs must 
                  be also set out in Annex 2 (additional information column). 
                  New in-kind contributions — If the need for third parties’ in-kind contributions was not known 
                  at the moment of the signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendment of the 
                  GA in order to introduce it in the Annex 1 (see Article 55). Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency 
                  may approve costs  related  to  in-kind  contributions  not  included  in  Annex  1  without  formally 
                  amending the GA (simplified approval procedure; for details, see Article 11).

               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
            investigations on the third parties (see Article 22), and in particular to audit their costs. 
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the third 
            parties (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility 
            of the costs, it will reject them).

                           13.1.1  If  necessary  to  implement  the  action,  the  beneficiaries  may  award  subcontracts  covering  the 
                           implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
                           Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action. 
                           The beneficiaries must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
                             lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).

                           [OPTION for actions involving PCP or PPI: In addition, for the pre-commercial procurement (PCP) or 
                             procurement  of  innovative  solutions  (PPI),  the  beneficiaries  must  follow  a  transparent  and  non-
                           discriminatory procedure, including at least the following: 
                                               (a)  an ‘open market consultation’ published in the Official Journal of the European Union via a

                                               (b)  a  ‘contract  notice’  allowing  for  a  time-limit  for  receipt  of  tenders  of  at  least  2  months, 
                                                       published in the Official Journal of the European Union and promoted and advertised widely; 
                                               (c)  a ‘request for tenders’ based on functional or performance-based specifications (that take into 
                                                       account the outcome of the open market consultation) and describing the practical set-up for

                                               (d)   an objective and non-discriminatory evaluation of the tenders and award of subcontract(s) to 
                                                       the tender(s) offering best value for money; 
                                               (e)  a ‘contract award notice’ published in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
                           The beneficiaries must also ensure that every prior information notice, contract notice or contract award 
                             notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer:

                             EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement. If the WTO Government Procurement Agreement 
                             applies, PPI subcontracts must also be open to tenderers from States that have ratified this agreement. 
                             If the procurement of the innovative solution (PPI) consists (and is limited to) buying a set of prototypes

                                      If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality, taking into account the value of the 
                                      contracts and the relative size of the EU contributions in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Specific rules must be based on the rules 
                                      contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable provisions should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set 
                                      for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000. The authorising officer may set a threshold higher than EUR 60 000 on the basis of a risk

              or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU) must comply with 
             the applicable national law on public procurement. 
              13.2   Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1, the costs related to the subcontract 
              concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
             43).  
              Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

            1. Subcontracting 
            If  necessary  to  implement  the  action,  the  beneficiaries  may  award  subcontracts  covering  the 
            implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
             
                      Subcontractors  —  Subcontractors  participate  in  the  action  by  carrying  out  action  tasks  for  the 
                  beneficiary.  They  are  NOT  beneficiaries  and  therefore  have  no  direct  obligations  under  the  grant 
                  agreement (but their beneficiaries must ensure that they comply with certain key obligations). 
                  Subcontract — For the purposes of the GA, a ‘subcontract’ means the purchase of goods, works or 
                  services that are identified in Annex 1 as action tasks. 
                      Example (subcontracts):  Contracts for (parts of) the research or innovation tasks mentioned in Annex 1. 
                  The  differences  between  purchase  contracts,  subcontracts,  in-kind  contributions  against  payment  and 
                  implementation by linked third parties are explained in Article 8. 
                       
             
                       
                Characteristics of subcontracting: 
                       Based on business conditions  
                      .  This means that the subcontractor charges a price, which usually includes a profit (— this 
                        distinguishes it from linked third parties; see Article 14). 
                       Subcontractor  works  without  the  direct  supervision  of  the  beneficiary  and  is  not 
                        hierarchically  subordinate  to  the  beneficiary  (—  this  distinguishes  it  from  action  tasks 
                        implemented by in-house consultants; see Article 6.2.A.2). 
                       Subcontractor's motivation is pecuniary, not the research work itself. The subcontractor is 
                        paid by the beneficiary in exchange for its work. 
                       Responsibility  towards  the  EU/Euratom  for  the  subcontracted  work  lies  fully  with  the 
                        beneficiary. 
                        The beneficiary remains responsible for all its rights and obligations under the GA, including 
                        the tasks carried out by a subcontractor.  
                       Subcontractor has no rights or obligations towards the Commission/Agency or the other 
                        beneficiaries (it has no contractual relation with them). 
                    Examples (subcontracts):  
                    Testing and analysis of the resistance of a new component under high temperatures, if described in Annex 1 
                    as action task. 
            Only limited parts of the action may be subcontracted — except for actions involving PCP/PPI 
            (because the PCP/PPI action tasks are by definition fully subcontracted). 
            The  beneficiaries  must  make  special  arrangements  regarding  results  produced  by  the 
            subcontractors (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see Article 
            26.3).  
                      Security  obligations  —  Stricter  rules  apply  for  action  tasks  that  involve  information  that  is  EU-
                  classified or results that are subject to limited disclosure/dissemination in Annex 1 of the GA (see 
                  Article 37). 
                      For  more  information  on  security  obligations,  see  the  Guidelines  for  the  handling  of  classified 
                  information in EU research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                   
                      Article 13 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 13.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
                  Article 13.1.2).

                      . 
                       
                   
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                 
            2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Best value for money or lowest price 
            The beneficiaries must base their subcontracts either on the best value for money (considering the 
            quality of the service proposed, i.e. the best price-quality ratio) or on the lowest price.  
                This requirement reflects the general cost eligibility condition set out in Article 6.1(a)(vii) 
                (i.e.  that  costs  must  be  reasonable  and  comply  with  the  principle  of  sound  financial 
                management) and applies it specifically to the subcontracting context.  
                The best value for money principle does NOT in all cases require competitive selection 
                procedures. However, if a beneficiary did not request several offers, it must demonstrate how 
                best value for money was ensured. 
                For the best price-quality ratio, price is an essential aspect (together with quality criteria, such 
                as technical quality, etc.), but it is NOT automatically necessary to select the offer with the 
                lowest price. Selecting the lowest price may however be appropriate for automatic award 
                procedures where the subcontract is awarded to the company that meets the conditions and 
                quotes the lowest price. 
                    In order to provide a good analysis of the price-quality ratio, the criteria defining quality 
                    must be clear and coherent with the purposes of the action task that is subcontracted. 
             
            3. Additional cost eligibility conditions for actions involving PCP or PPI 
            This  additional  option  will  be  inserted  into  the  GA  if  the  action  involves  pre-commercial 
            procurement (PCP) or procurement of innovative solutions (PPI). 
                      This concerns research and innovation actions or innovation actions with a PCP or PPI.  
                  This should NOT be confused with PCP/PPI action (separate type of action, which use a different model 
                  grant agreement and whose main action task is the implementation of the PCP or PPI). 
                   
            The additional rules mirror the key obligations for PCP/PPI actions from the H2020 MGA PCP/PPI.  
                      . 
             
                       
            4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Tasks set out in Annex 1 — Total estimated 
                   
               costs of subcontracting set out in Annex 2 — Simplified approval procedure 
                   
            The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in 
                   
            Annex 1. 
                   
                It is the work (i.e. the action tasks) to be performed by a subcontractor that must be identified 
                in Annex 1. The name of the subcontractors is in principle not necessary.  
                   
                The description should also include an estimation of costs for each subcontract.  
                Moreover,  it  should  explain  the  need  for  a  subcontract,  taking  into  account  the  specific 
                characteristics of the action. 
                       If  the  name of  the  subcontractor is known at the time of the grant signature the beneficiary may 
                indicate it in Annex 1. However, the fact that the name of the subcontractor is indicated in Annex 1 does not 
                imply the approval of the Commission of the subcontract (or the subcontracting costs). For example, if the 
                subcontractor was not selected based on best value-for-money the Commission may reject the costs even if 
                its name was indicated in Annex 1. 
                  
            Additionally, the total estimated costs for subcontracting per beneficiary must appear in the 
                    . 
            table of estimated costs of Annex 2.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            New subcontracts — If the need for  a  subcontract  is  not  foreseen  at  the  moment  of  the 
            signature of the GA, the coordinator must request an amendment of the GA in order to introduce 
            it in Annex 1 and 2 (see Article 55). Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency may approve costs 
            related  to  subcontracts  not  included  in  Annex  1  and  2  without  formally  amending  the  GA 
            (simplified approval procedure). 
                The new subcontract must be included and explained in the technical periodic report (in the 
                section ‘unforeseen subcontractor’).  
                Approval will NOT be granted if the subcontract risks to substantially change the nature of the 
                project (i.e. there is a doubt whether the project is still (in substance) the same as the one 
                that was selected or whether the beneficiary has still the operational capacity to carry out the 
                action).  
                    Example (approval): A beneficiary loses some personnel specialised in a particular field, and as a result 
                    decides to subcontract some tasks it had originally foreseen to carry out itself. The beneficiary fails to 
                    inform the coordinator of this fact and therefore the GA is not amended. These circumstances are declared 
                    in the periodic report and it is approved by the Commission. 
                    Example (no approval): A key beneficiary leaves the consortium and the coordinator subcontracts all the 
                    tasks of this beneficiary.  
                 
                     The approval is at the full discretion of the Commission/Agency and there is no automatic entitlement to 
                 it.  Beneficiaries  that  rely  on  the  simplified  approval  procedure  bear  the  full  risk  of  non-approval  and 
                 rejection of costs by the Commission/Agency.  
                  
             
                  
            5.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Controls  on  the  subcontractor  (by  the 
                  
               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
                     . 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                      
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
            investigations on the subcontractor (see Article 22). 
                  
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
                  
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
                  
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
                  
            subcontractors (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the 
            eligibility of the costs, it will reject them). 
                  
             
            6. ‘Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to subcontractors 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontractors comply with certain obligations under the 
            GA. 
                Obligations that must be extended to subcontractors: 
                       Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                       Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                       Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                       Liability for damages (see Article 46). 
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
            subcontractors. 
                Best  practice:  In  order  to  be  able  to  fulfil  this  obligation,  the  beneficiaries  should  impose 
                contractual arrangements on the third parties.

                  7. ‘Other obligation’: Compliance with national procurement rules 
                  Beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ (within the meaning of the 
                                                                                                                                  37
                  EU public procurement Directives 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU ) must moreover comply with 
                  the applicable national law on public procurement. These rules normally provide for a special 
                  procurement procedure for the types of contracts they cover.  
                         ‘Contracting  authority’  means  the  State,  regional  or  local  authorities,  bodies  governed  by 
                         public law, associations formed by one or several of such authorities or one or several of such 
                         bodies governed by public law (see Article 2.1(1) of Directive 2014/24/EU). 
                               ‘Bodies governed by public law’ also include entities financed mostly by the State, regional 
                               or local authorities, or other bodies governed by public law and entities controlled by those 
                               bodies (for the full definition, see Article 2.1(4) of that Directive). 
                         ‘Contracting entities’ means entities operating in a utilities sector (water, energy, transport, 
                         postal services). They may be contracting authorities, public undertakings or entities operating 
                         on the basis of special or exclusive rights (for the full definition see Article 4 of Directive 
                         2014/25/EU).  
                   
                  Specific cases (subcontracting): 
                  Subcontracting between beneficiaries — Is NOT allowed in the same GA. All beneficiaries contribute 
                  to and are interested in the action; if one beneficiary needs the services of another in order to perform 
                  its part of the work it is the second beneficiary who should declare the costs for that work.  
                  Subcontracting to affiliates — Is NOT allowed, unless they have a framework contract or the affiliate 
                  is their usual provider, and the subcontract is priced at market conditions. Otherwise, these affiliates 
                  may work in the action, but they must be identified as linked third parties under Article 14 and declare 
                  their own costs.  
                  Coordination tasks of the coordinator (e.g. distribution of funds, review of reports and others tasks 
                  listed under Article 41.2(b)) — Can NOT be subcontracted. Other activities of the coordinator may in 
                  principle be subcontracted. 
                  Framework contracts or subcontracts — Framework contracts can be used for selecting a provider if 
                  this is the usual practice of the beneficiary (e.g. for a type of service). In order to be eligible, the 
                  framework contract must (have) be(en) awarded on the basis of best-value-for-money and absence of 
                  conflict of interest. The framework contract does not necessarily have to be concluded before the start 
                  of the action.

                                                 the beneficiary (see Annex 3a)] 
                                       -         [name of the entity (short name)], affiliated or linked to [short name of the beneficiary] [OPTION 
                                                 if joint and several liability has been requested:, if it has accepted joint and several liability with

                                              [same for more linked third parties]  
                           The linked third parties may declare as eligible the costs they incur for implementing the action tasks in 
                           accordance with Article 6.3.  
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission , the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
                           their linked third parties. 
                           14.1.2 The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 18, 20, 35, 36 and 38 also apply to

                           If any obligation under Article 14.1.1 is breached, the costs of the linked third party will be ineligible (see 
                            Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42).  
                           If any obligation under Article 14.1.2 is breached, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.] 
                           [OPTION 2: Not applicable] 
                            
                           30        For the definition see Article 2.1(2) Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013: ‘affiliated entity’ means any legal entity that is: 
                                              -        under the direct or indirect control of a participant, or 
                                              -        under the same direct or indirect control as the participant, or  
                                              -        directly or indirectly controlling a participant.  
                                     ‘Control’ may take any of the following forms: 
                                              (a)      the direct or indirect holding of more than 50% of the nominal value of the issued share capital in the legal entity concerned, 
                                                       or of a majority of the voting rights of the shareholders or associates of that entity; 
                                              (b)      the direct or indirect holding, in fact or in law, of decision-making powers in the legal entity concerned. 
                                     However, the following relationships between legal entities shall not in themselves constitute controlling relationships: 
                                              (a)      the same public investment corporation, institutional investor or venture-capital company has a direct or indirect holding of 
                                                       more than 50% of the nominal value of the issued share capital or a majority of voting rights of the shareholders or associates; 
                                              (b)      the legal entities concerned are owned or supervised by the same public body. 
                           31        ‘Third party with a legal link to a beneficiary’ is any legal entity which has a legal link to the beneficiary implying collaboration that 
                                     is not limited to the action.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 6 and other provisions) will 
            be inserted into the GA if the action is implemented with linked third parties. 
                 
                     Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to participate in the action, like the beneficiary 
                  they are linked to. They are NOT beneficiaries, but they are allowed to participate fully in the action and 
                 receive EU funding; they will therefore be treated for many issues (including cost eligibility; see Article 6.3) 
                  like beneficiaries and their beneficiaries must ensure that they comply with certain key obligations. 
                      Combining  H2020  &  other  EU  grants  —  The  terminologies  under  different  EU  funds/funding 
                 programmes may differ (e.g. ‘linked third parties’ under H2020 are the SAME as ‘affiliated entities’ under 
                  the Financial Regulation, while ‘affiliated entities’ under H2020 is NARROWER than ‘affiliated entities’ under 
                 the  Financial  Regulation    (see  Articles  2.1(2)  and  23(5)  of  the  Rules  for  Participation  Regulation  No 
                  1290/2013 and Article 122 of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012). 
                   
                   
                  
                Characteristics of implementation by linked third parties: 
                       Linked third party does not charge a price, but declares its own costs for implementing the 
                        action tasks.  
                       Linked third party itself performs certain action tasks directly and is responsible for them 
                        towards the beneficiary. Linked third parties do NOT sign the GA (and are therefore not 
                        beneficiaries). 
                       The beneficiary remains responsible towards the Commission/Agency for the work carried 
                        out by the linked third party.  
                        Moreover, the beneficiaries are financially responsible for any undue amount paid by the 
                        Commission/Agency as reimbursement of costs for their linked third parties — unless the 
                        GA foresees joint and several liability (see Article 44.1). 
                       Work is attributed to the linked third party (in Annex 1) and is usually carried out on its 
                        premises.  
                       Work is under the full and direct control, instructions and management of the linked third 
                        party, who carries out this part of the action (with its employees). 
            Only affiliated entities or entities with a legal link to a beneficiary can be linked third 
            parties.  
                ‘Entities with a legal link’ refers to an established relationship (between the third party and the 
                beneficiary), which is: 
                       broad and not specifically created for the work in the GA  
                       Accordingly, its duration must go beyond the action duration and it usually pre-dates 
                       and outlasts the GA; ad hoc collaboration agreements or contracts to carry out work in 
                       the  action  are  NOT  covered.  In  this  latter  case,  both  legal  entities  should  be 
                       beneficiaries. 
                   AND 
                      a legal relationship. 
                       This may be either a legal structure (e.g. the relationship between an association and 
                       its members) or through an agreement or contract not limited to the action (e.g. a 
                       collaboration agreement for research in a particular field). 
                       If the only relation between two entities is a capital link (i.e. ownership of part of the 
                       issued share capital), the entity may only participate as a linked third party if it is an 
                       ‘affiliated entity’ (see below). 
                ‘Affiliated entity’ means: 
                      under the direct or indirect control of the beneficiary or 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14                                                            151 
              EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                      General MGA 
                          under the same direct or indirect control as the beneficiary or  
                          directly or indirectly controlling the beneficiary. 
                       Affiliated  entities  cover  not  only  the  case  of  parent  companies  or  holdings  and  their 
                       daughter companies or subsidiaries and vice-versa, but also the case of affiliates between 
                       themselves (e.g. entities controlled by the same entity). 
                   Examples (entities with a legal link): 
                   1. Joint Research Units (JRU) (i.e. research laboratories/infrastructures created and owned by two or more 
                   different legal entities in order to carry out research) — They do not have a separate legal personality, but form 
                   a single research unit where staff and resources from the different members are put together to the benefit of 
                   all. Though lacking legal personality, they exist physically, with premises, equipment, and resources individual 
                   to them and distinct from ‘owner’ entities. A member of the JRU is the beneficiary and any other member of the 
                   JRU contributing to the action and who is not a beneficiary of the GA has to be identified in Article 14. The JRU 
                   has to meet all the following conditions: 
                                scientific and economic unity 
                                last a certain length of time 
                                recognised by a public authority.  
                       It is necessary that the JRU itself is recognised by a public authority, i.e. an entity identified as such under 
                       the  applicable  national  law.  The  beneficiary  must  provide  to  the  Commission/Agency,  a  copy  of  the 
                       resolution, law, decree, decision, attesting the relationship between the beneficiary and the linked third 
                       party(ies), or a copy of the document establishing the ‘joint research unit’, or any other document that 
                       proves that research facilities are put in a common structure and correspond to the concept of scientific and 
                       economic unit. 
                   2. Associations, foundations or other legal entities composed of members — That entity is generally the 
                   beneficiary and the members are the linked third parties.  
                   Examples (affiliated entities):  
                   1. Company A established in France holding 20% of the shares in Company B established in Italy. However, 
                   with 20% of the shares it has 60% of the voting rights in company B. Therefore, company A controls company 
                   B and both companies may be linked third parties in a H2020 GA.  
                   2. Company X and company Y do not control each other, but they are both owned by company Z. They are both 
                   considered affiliated entities. 
              Linked third parties must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding under H2020 
              as beneficiaries (for instance, be established in an EU Member State, H2020 associated country or 
                                                                                                         38
              third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work Programme).  
                       Example: Company A established in the UK is a beneficiary in a grant. A owns B, a French company and 
                       also owns C, an US company. B & C may be considered affiliates to A, however only B may declare costs as 
                       a third party linked to A, because company C is established in a third country that is not eligible for funding 
                       under Article 10 of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013. 
                        For more information on conditions for participation and funding, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online 
                    Manual. 
               
              They must be named in Article 14 and their action tasks and estimated costs must be set out in 
              Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or if the linked third party is added 
              later, through an amendment; see Article 55). 
              The beneficiaries must make special arrangements regarding results produced by the linked third 
              parties (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see Article 26.3).  
              The  Commission/Agency  may  (during  the  selection  procedure)  require  joint  and  several 
              liability of a linked third party, if: 
                      the financial capacity of a beneficiary is ‘weak’ and 
                      the beneficiary mainly coordinates the work of its linked third party.

                Examples: 
                1.  The financially  weak beneficiary is  an  association  and  most of  the  work  is  carried  out by  several of  its 
                members as linked third parties. 
                2. The financially weak beneficiary is a small company with a substantial part of its work implemented by a 
                bigger affiliated company. 
                3.  The  proposal  submitted  by  four  independent  entities  established  in  four  Member  States  is  positively 
                evaluated.  The four successful  applicants decide  to  form  a  legal  entity  to  simplify  the  management  of  the 
                project. The newly established entity will be the beneficiary, i.e. a new legal entity. The successful applicants will 
                carry out the work as linked third parties of the new legal entity. 
                If requested, the third party must accept joint and several liability with the beneficiary. 
                    In this case it must sign a declaration (on paper and in blue-ink, using Annex 3a) to be 
                    submitted  by  the  beneficiary  at  the  moment  of  its  accession  to  the  GA  (or  of  the 
                    amendment introducing the linked third party in the GA; see Article 56). The linked third 
                    party must send the original to the beneficiary (by registered post with proof of delivery), 
                    who must upload it (as a scanned PDF copy) in the system. 
                                 Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its 
                              files. 
                               
                The liability is for any amount owned by the beneficiary under the GA, and up to the linked 
                third party’s maximum EU contribution in Annex 2. 
                                  . 
                                   
                    For more information on the financial capacity check, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                               
                               
            Entities performing a substantial part of the work (i.e. action tasks) should in principle be 
            beneficiaries, NOT linked third parties. Linked third parties should only exceptionally perform a 
                               
            major part of the R&I work. 
                               
                    Examples:  
                    1. Entities specifically established for the purpose of implementing the action (e.g. EEIGs).  
                               
                    2. National research associations established according to the national law in order to carry out research not 
                    limited to the action.  
                    3. A group of legal entities (companies/research organisations) that have a common research agenda and 
                    that have a structure consisting of an association coordinating the research. This structure/consortium is not 
                    limited to the H2020 action and the members have strong contractual commitments among each other and 
                    the coordinating association. The association represents its members and coordinates administratively their 
                    work in the action, even if it is not performing any R&I work in the action. In this case, the association may 
                    be the beneficiary and the members of the association are its linked third parties carrying out the R&I work. 
             
                 Article 14 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 14.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in Article 
            14.1.2).  
             
             
                . 
            2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Linked third parties identified in Article 14 
                 
               — Tasks set out in  Annex  1  —  Estimated  costs  set  out  in  Annex  2  —  No 
               simplified approval procedure 
             
            The linked third parties must be named in Article 14 and their tasks and estimated costs must be 
            identified in Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or added later, through 
             
            an amendment; see Article 55). 
             
            There is NO simplified approval procedure.

            3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Costs of the linked third party  
            The linked third parties may declare their costs (in their financial statements; see Article 20.3), if 
            the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6.3 are fulfilled (e.g. actually incurred by the linked 
            third party, necessary for the action, incurred during the action duration, etc.).  
                The costs must be recorded in the accounts of the linked third party.  
                Linked third parties may declare costs for all cost categories (as provided for in Article 5), 
                including indirect costs (at the 25% flat rate). 
                Each linked third party declares its own costs. The costs of the linked third party must not be 
                included in the beneficiary’s financial statements.  
            Each  linked  third  party  has  its  own  financial  statements,  but  these  statements  must  be 
            submitted by its beneficiary (since linked third parties cannot sign them in the IT system; see 
            Article 20).  
                For this purpose, linked third parties must send their signed financial statements on paper to 
                their beneficiary.  
                           Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its files 
                        (see Article 18.1.2). 
                         
            Each linked third party has to provide its own certificate on the financial statements (CFS; 
                            . 
            see Article 20.4).  
                             
                The  threshold  of  EUR  325  000  applies  to  each  linked  third  party  (independently  of  its 
                beneficiary).  
                         
                           Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its files (see 
                       Article 18.1.2). 
                         
                         
                           . 
            4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Controls on the linked third parties (by the 
                            
               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
                        
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
                        
            investigations on the linked third parties (see Article 22), and in particular to audit their costs and 
                        
            proper implementation of action tasks. 
                        
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
                        
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the linked 
            third parties (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the 
            eligibility of the costs, it will reject them). 
             
            5. ‘Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to linked third parties 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the linked third parties comply with certain obligations under 
            the GA. 
                Obligations that must be extended to linked third parties: 
                       Record-keeping obligations (see Article 18) 
                       Reporting (see Article 20) 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 14                                                            154

                       Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                       Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                       Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                Best  practice:  In  order  to  be  able  to  fulfil  this  obligation,  the  beneficiaries  should  impose 
                contractual arrangements on the third parties. 
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the linked 
            third parties.

                           ARTICLE 14a — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS 
                           [OPTION 1: 14a.1 Rules for calling upon international partners to implement part of the action  
                                                                                                          37
                              The following international partners  may implement the action tasks attributed to them in Annex 1: 
                                        -          [name of the entity (short name)], international partner of [short name of the beneficiary]  
                                        -          [name of the entity (short name)], international partner of [short name of the beneficiary]  
                                               [same for more international partners]  
                          
                              The costs of the international partners are estimated in Annex 2 but:  
                          
                                          will not be reimbursed and 
                                                  
                                          will not be taken into account for the calculation of the grant. 
                                                  
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission , the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                              and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also 
                           towards their international partners. 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 18.1.1, 20.3(a), 20.4(a), 35, 36 and 38 
                              also apply to their international partners.  
                          
                           14a.2               Consequences of non-compliance  
                           If a beneficiary braches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                              Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.] 
                          
                              [OPTION 2: Not applicable] 
                          
                              37       ‘International partner’ is any legal entity established in a non-associated third country which is not eligible for funding under Article 10 
                                       of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013. 
                          
                                            
                         1. International partners 
                         This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 4) will be inserted into the 
                         GA if the action is implemented with international partners. It was introduced with GA version 4.0 
                         and does NOT automatically apply to older grant agreements (however beneficiaries with older 
                         GAs may ask for an amendment to introduce international partners see Article 55). 
                                            International partners — International partners are allowed to participate in the action without EU 
                                    funding.  They  are  NOT  beneficiaries  and  do  NOT  receive  EU  funding;  they  therefore  have  no  direct 
                                     obligations under the grant agreement (but their beneficiaries must to ensure that they comply with certain 
                                    key obligations). 
                                     
                                  Characteristics of implementation by international partners: 
                                                  International partners perform their action tasks directly. They do NOT sign the GA (and are 
                                                   therefore not beneficiaries).  
                                                  The beneficiary remains responsible towards the Commission/Agency for the action tasks 
                                                   performed by its international partner.

                                     International partners perform their action tasks without receiving EU funding, i.e. their 
                                      costs  are  NOT  eligible  for  reimbursement  under  the  grant.  Therefore,  they  will  not  be 
                                      subject to financial checks, reviews or audits. 
                                      The costs of the international partners are estimated in Annex 2 (to get an overview of the 
                                      overall project budget). But this is for information purposes only, the international partners 
                                      are not required to report on their costs. 
                  International partners do NOT need to have a (capital or legal) link to the beneficiary (but they 
                  may have one).  
                  They must NOT be eligible for funding, i.e. be: 
                   -      a legal entity established in a third country not listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work 
                          Programme or 
                          Example:  A  consortium  of  legal  entities  from  EU  Member  States,  H2020  associated  countries  and  third 
                          countries listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work Programme wants to work with a legal entity established 
                          in New Zealand. Since the New Zealand entity would like to be involved in the action without requesting EU 
                          funding and without becoming a beneficiary, one of the beneficiaries may decide to list the New Zealand entity

                          agrees to the action tasks and the related obligations under the GA).

                   -      an international organisation other than international European interest organisations . 
                  They may be used to implement any of the action tasks. 
                  They must be named in Article 14a and their action tasks and estimated costs must be set out in 
                  Annexes 1 and 2 already at the moment of the GA signature (or if the international partner is 
                  added later, through an amendment; see Article 55). 
                  The  beneficiaries  must  make  special  arrangements  regarding  results  produced  by  the 
                  international partners (in order to be able to fully comply with their obligations under the GA; see 
                  Article 26.3).  
                  Although they are not beneficiaries and do not receive EU funding, their beneficiaries must ensure 
                  that they comply with certain key (non-financial) obligations:  
                  Thus, they must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
                  the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22 to verify the 
                  proper implementation of the action tasks and that the Commission/Agency has the right to make 
                  an evaluation of the impact of the action under Article 23.  
                  Moreover, they must extend the following obligations under the GA to the international partners:  
                         Obligations that must be extended to international partners: 
                                     Record-keeping  obligations  (on  the  scientific  and  technical  implementation;  see  Article 
                                      18.1.1) 
                                     Technical reporting (in the required language; see Article 20.3(a), 20.4(a) and 20.7) 
                                     Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                                     Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                                     Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38). 
                  It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
                  international partners.

                                              Actions may involve financial support to third parties ONLY where this is explicitly allowed in the work

                                           Examples: 
                                         1. An innovation project in the area of sustainable agriculture and forestry includes financial support for 
                                         end-users (farmers) testing the technology developed within the action. 
                                           2. One of the work packages in Annex 1 includes funding for awarding three research scholarships in the

                Support in kind (e.g. transfer of material for free) by the beneficiary to a third party is NOT 
                considered financial support. 
            Linked third parties may provide financial support to third parties under the same conditions as 
            the beneficiaries. 
            The recipients are not party to the GA and therefore do NOT need to be identified in the GA or 
            have a PIC. 
             
                   Article  15.1 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 15.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
              Article 15.1.2).  
               
                 . 
            2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Conditions for support set out in Annex 1 — 
               Maximum amount of the financial support — Types of activities — Categories of 
                  
               persons — Criteria for financial support  
            The beneficiaries must comply with the conditions for the support that are set out in Annex 1, and 
              
            in particular: 
                  the maximum amount per third party  
              
                    The maximum amount may normally NOT be more than EUR 60 000 per recipient. A higher 
                    amount can exceptionally be set out in Annex 1, if the work programme/call explicitly 
                    allows it and the proposal (and Annex 1) explain why this is necessary for the objectives of 
                    the action. 
                    This is a limit per recipient; several recipients could receive up to EUR 60 000 each (e.g. 3 
                    grants of EUR 50 000 each). 
                  the criteria for determining the exact amount of financial support  (e.g. EUR 2 000 per 
                    hectare; EUR 30 000 per student for a two-year scholarship) 
                    The financial support provided by the beneficiaries may take any form (e.g. a lump sum or 
                    the  reimbursement  of  the  costs  incurred  by  the  recipients  when  implementing  the 
                    supported activities). 
                  a clear and exhaustive list of the types of activities that qualify for financial support for 
                    third  parties  (e.g.  financial  support  for  third  parties  allowed  for  technology-testing 
                    activities) 
                    These activities should benefit, primarily, the recipients (NOT the beneficiaries). 
                    The financial support is NOT the same as subcontracting (see Article 13) or purchase of 
                    goods, works or services (see Article 10). 
                  the persons or category(ies) of persons that may receive it (e.g. farmers; PhD students) 
                    Beneficiaries should describe in Annex 1 the procedures for selecting the recipients. 
                  the criteria for giving financial support (e.g. physical characteristics of the agricultural plots 
                    which make them suitable for the purpose of the action). 
                    These criteria should respond to the objectives set out in the work programme/call. 
            The conditions must also already be part of the proposal (see the proposal templates).

            3.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Controls  on  the  recipients  (by  the 
               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
            investigations on the recipients (see Article 22). 
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the recipients 
            (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility of the 
            costs, it will reject them). 
             
            4. ‘Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to recipients 
            The beneficiaries are responsible for the proper use of the funding by the recipients and must 
            ensure that they comply with certain obligations under the GA. 
                Obligations that must be extended to recipients: 
                       Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                       Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                       Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                       Liability for damages (see Article 46). 
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
            recipients.  
                 Best practice: In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, the beneficiaries should to impose 
                 contractual  arrangements  on  the  recipients  (including  control  measures  and/or  reducing  the 
                 financial support).

                                       (b)   the award criteria;

                                       (d)   the payment arrangements. 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22  and 23 also 
                           towards the third parties receiving a prize.  
                           15.2.2 The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to 
                           the third parties receiving a prize.]

                         This optional Article (together with the corresponding options in Article 6 and other provisions) will 
                         be inserted into the GA if the action involves financial support to third parties in the form of prizes. 
                                   Example: Inducement prize announced at the beginning of the action for identifying a (new) approach to 
                                   dealing with a technical implementation problem to be tackled at the end of the action. 
                         Such prizes are NOT EU prizes (although the beneficiaries must  promote the action and give 
                         visibility to the EU funding received; see Article 38).

               Conditions for participation — Award criteria — Amount of the prize — Payment 
               arrangements 
            Just like for financial support via grants, the beneficiaries must comply with the conditions for 
            support that are set out in Annex 1 and in particular: 
                  the conditions for participation and the conditions for early termination of the contest, if 
                    any (e.g. eligibility and exclusion criteria; deadline for submission of entries; possibility of 
                    hearings) 
                  the award criteria for assessing the quality of entries in light of the objectives and expected 
                    results 
                    The criteria must be objective. 
                  the amount of the prize (e.g. EUR 70 000) 
                  the payment arrangements (usually one instalment). 
             
            3.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Controls  on  the  recipients  (by  the 
               Commission/Agency, ECA and OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
            investigations on the recipients of a prize, to verify that the conditions for the award of the prize 
            have been respected (see Article 22). 
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make evaluations of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the recipients 
            (for example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility of the 
            costs, it will reject them).  
             
            4. ‘Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to recipients 
            The beneficiaries are responsible for the award of the prize to the recipients and must ensure that 
            they comply with certain obligations under the GA. 
                Obligations that must be extended to recipients: 
                       Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                       Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                       Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                       Liability for damages (see Article 46). 
            It  is  the  beneficiaries’  responsibility  to  ensure  that  these  obligations  are  accepted  by  the 
            recipients.

                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                               General MGA 
                                     For ‘integrating activities’, access to research infrastructure is a mandatory component, 
                                     while it is optional for the other two topics. ‘Cluster support’ actions currently only 
                                     include pilot provision of trans-national access, no virtual access (see the H2020 Work 
                                     Programme 2014-2015). 
                  Grants for this type of action usually reimburse — for the provision of access activity — the 
                  following types of costs: 
                                                                                                                                                      40                          41
                              ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the research infrastructure  or installation  and 
                               costs related to logistical, technological and scientific support for users, including ad-hoc 
                               user training and the preparatory and closing activities needed to use the installation) 
                              users’ travel and subsistence costs 
                              costs of advertising the trans-national access offered under the action 
                              costs related to  the selection procedure  (e.g. the selection panel members’ travel and 
                               subsistence costs, logistical costs of meetings, fees, etc.) 
                              costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the 
                               periodic technical reports (see Article 20.3). 
                         The access costs may be declared as unit costs, actual costs or — under certain conditions — 
                         as a combination of the two (see Articles 5.2(f) and 6.2.F), while the other costs in this list 
                         must be declared as actual costs (see Articles 5.2(d) and 6.2.D). 
                               If access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget category 
                               F.2 ‘access costs for providing trans-national access to research infrastructure’ (see Article 
                               5.2(f) and 6.2.F).  
                               If  they  are  declared  as  actual  costs,  they  must  be  declared  under  the  other  budget 
                               categories (see Articles 5.2(a-e) and 6.2.A-E). 
                         Capital  investments  (i.e.  equipment  costs  for  renting,  leasing,  purchasing  depreciable 
                         equipment, infrastructure or other assets) will NOT be reimbursed (for the provision of access 
                         activities; see Article 6.2.D.2). 
                  Trans-national access must be measured (in ‘units of access’). 
                         The units of access for the various installations that provide trans-national access under the 
                         grant must be specified in Annex 1 of the GA. 
                               Examples (units of access): per beam-hour for a synchrotron; per night for a telescope; per number of 
                               frozen embryos for a mouse repository; per week of access for a historical archive; per campaign-day for a 
                               research vessel. 
                         For  trans-national  access,  the  GA  will  always  specify  a  unit  of  access  (independently  of 
                         whether the costs are declared as unit cost or actual costs). 
                   
                   
                   
                                                              
                  40
                         For the definition of research infrastructure, see Article 2(6) of the H2020 Framework Programme Regulation No 
                         (EU) No 1291/2013 and the footnote in Article 6.2.D.4 of the MGA: ‘Research infrastructure’ are facilities, 
                         resources and services that are used by the research communities to conduct research and foster innovation in 
                         their fields. Where relevant, they may be used beyond research, e.g. for education or public services. They 
                         include: major scientific equipment (or sets of instruments); knowledge-based resources such as collections, 
                         archives or scientific data; e-infrastructure such as data and computing systems and communication networks; 
                         and any other infrastructure of a unique nature essential to achieve excellence in research and innovation. Such 
                         infrastructure may be ‘single-sited’, ‘virtual’ or ‘distributed’. 
                  41
                         ‘Installation’ means a part or a service of a research infrastructure that could be used independently from the 
                         rest. A research infrastructure consists of one or more installations.

                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                             General MGA 
                                   Record-keeping — The beneficiaries must keep appropriate records and supporting documentation 
                              to justify the number of units of trans-national access for which they declare costs (see Article 18), 
                              including: 
                                          users’ names, nationalities and home institutions 
                                          the nature of access and  
                                          the number of units of access provided. 
                               
                  In addition, they must include (just like for virtual access) detailed information on the provision of 
                               
                  access activity in the periodic technical reports (see Article 20.3). 
                                    . 
                                     
                           Article 16.1 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 16.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
                     Article 16.1.2).  
                               
                     
                               
                            .  
                  2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Access which must be provided  
                               
                  Trans-national access can be either: 
                               
                              in person (hands-on), provided to selected users that visit the installation or 
                              remote, through the provision to selected users of remote scientific services. 
                                      Examples (remote access): provision of reference materials or samples (e.g. shipping of a virus 
                                      strain);  performing  a  remote  sample  analysis  or  sample  deposition;  remote  access  to  a  high-
                                      performance computing facility. 
                               Remote trans-national  access  requires  competitive  selection  of  the  users  to  be  served 
                               under the GA as usually it applies to resources that are not unlimited (e.g. computing 
                               hours on a supercomputer or remote analysis of a sample). It is thus different from virtual 
                               access,  which  applies  to  resources  that  can  be  simultaneously  used  by  an  unlimited 
                               number of users (e.g. a dataset available on the internet). 
                         Trans-national access must be given to selected user groups (free of charge). 
                   
                  3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Categories of users that may have access — 
                       Limited access for special user groups 
                  For trans-national access, user groups in which all or most users work in non-associated third 
                  countries may ONLY have access for up to 20 % of the total number of units of access provided 
                  under the grant. 
                         The consortium should itself  define  if  this  20 %  limit  is  uniformly  applied  to  the  different 
                         installations or if the above mentioned user groups may use some installations more than 
                         others. It should do this in the consortium agreement.  
                   
                  4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Selection procedure with a selection panel 
                  For trans-national access, access providers must set up a common selection panel that regularly 
                  evaluates the applications for access and recommends a shortlist of the user groups that would 
                  benefit from access. 
                         If justified, an access provider may use several different selection sub-panels. 
                               Example: Different thematic selection sub-panels could be set up for a set of analytical facilities serving 
                               multidisciplinary communities.

            5. ’Other obligation’: Controls on the users (by the Commission/Agency, ECA and 
               OLAF) — Evaluation of the impact of the action  
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have the right to carry out checks, reviews, audits and 
            investigations on the users (see Article 22), and in particular to audit proper implementation of 
            action tasks. 
            They must also ensure that the Commission/Agency has the right to make an evaluation of the 
            impact of the action under Article 23.  
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the users (for 
            example, if they refuse access and the Commission/Agency cannot verify the eligibility of the 
            costs, it will reject them). 
             
            6. ’Other obligation’: Extension of obligations under the GA to users  
            The beneficiaries must also ensure that the users comply with certain obligations under the GA. 
                Obligations that must be extended to users: 
                   Avoiding conflicts of interest (see Article 35)  
                   Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                   Promoting the action and give visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                   Liability for damages (see Article 46). 
            It is the beneficiaries’ responsibility to ensure that these obligations are accepted by the users.

                         be inserted into the GA if the action involves virtual access to research infrastructure for scientific 
                         communities (‘provision of access activities’), i.e. actions under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Research 
                         infrastructures’. 
                         Grants for this type of actions usually reimburse — for the provision of access activity — the 
                         following types of costs: 
                                          ‘access costs’ (i.e. the operating costs of the installation during the course of the action 
                                           and costs related to technological and scientific support for users access (e.g. a helpdesk) 
                                          costs of advertising virtual access offered under the action 
                                          costs related to the assessment carried out by the board of international experts (e.g. 
                                           costs of organising a board meeting)

                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                               General MGA 
                              costs of preparing the detailed access activity information that must be included in the 
                               periodic technical reports (see Article 20.3) and the assessment report (see below point 3). 
                               As from  the Work Programme 2020, the access costs may be declared as unit costs, 
                               actual costs or — under certain conditions — as a combination of the two (see Articles 
                               5.2(f) and 6.2.F), while the other costs in this list must be declared as actual costs (see 
                               Articles 5.2(d) and 6.2.D). 
                                       If  access costs are declared as unit cost, they must be declared under the budget 
                                       category  F.2  ‘access  costs  for  providing  trans-national  access  to  research 
                                       infrastructure’ (see Article 5.2(f) and 6.2.F).  
                                       If they are declared as actual costs, they must be declared under the other budget 
                                       categories (see Articles 5.2(a-e) and 6.2.A-E). 
                       Capital  investments  (i.e.  costs  of  renting,  leasing,  purchasing  depreciable  equipment, 
                       infrastructure  or  other  assets)  will  NOT  be  reimbursed  —  unless  provided  for  in  the  work 
                       programme/call. In this case only the portion used to provide virtual access under the project is 
                       eligible.  
                  Virtual access may or may not be measured. If measured, the GA will specify a unit of access.  
                  When the research infrastructure access policy requires the identification of users, the EU financial 
                  support to virtual access will cover the access costs  incurred by the infrastructure or installation 
                  for the provision of access under the grant to the identified users. The proposal can also define 
                  eligibility  criteria  (e.g.  affiliation  to  a  research  or  academic  institution)  for  the  users  to  whom 
                  access will be provided under the grant 
                  When access is provided without identifying users, the research infrastructures virtual services to 
                                                                                                                                                                 42
                  be supported by the EU must be widely used by the European research community .  
                  The beneficiaries  must  provide  detailed  information  on  the  provision  of  access  activity  in  the 
                  periodic technical reports including, when access is provided without identifying users,statistics 
                  on all users in the reporting period compiled through web analytical tools (see Article 20.3). 
                   
                             Article 16.2 contains additional cost eligibility conditions.  
                        
                  2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Access which must be provided  
                              . 
                               
                  Virtual  access  applies  to  widely-used  research  resources  that  are  openly  and  freely  available 
                  through communication networks. 
                        
                         Example: access to an open database available on the internet  
                         Access must be open to all users; users are not selected. 
                        
                  3.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Periodic  assessment  by  a  board  of 
                       international experts 
                        
                  For  virtual  access,  the  access  services  must  be  regularly  assessed  by  an  external  board  of 
                  international experts. 
                         At least two assessments are usually carried out during the course of an action. 
                  The assessment reports must already be part of the proposal (as deliverables; see the proposal 
                  templates) and be included in Annex 1 of the GA. 
                                                              
                  42
                         Under the H2020-INFRAEOSC-2018-2020 call, other communities could be considered in order to widen the user 
                         base.

                           17.1               General obligation to provide information upon request 
                           The beneficiaries must provide — during implementation of the action or afterwards and in accordance with 
                           Article 41.2 — any information requested in order to verify eligibility of the costs, proper implementation 
                             of the action and compliance with any other obligation under the Agreement. 
                          
                           17.2               Obligation to keep information up to date and to inform about events and circumstances 
                                              likely to affect the Agreement 
                           Each  beneficiary  must  keep  information  stored  in  the  Participant  Portal  Beneficiary  Register  (via  the 
                           electronic exchange system; see Article 52) up to date, in particular, its name, address, legal representatives, 
                             legal form and organisation type. 
                           Each  beneficiary  must  immediately  inform  the  coordinator  —  which  must  immediately  inform  the 
                           [Commission][Agency] and the other beneficiaries — of any of the following: 
                                    (a)  events which are likely to affect significantly or delay the implementation of the action or the EU’s 
                                              financial interests, in particular: 
                                            (i)        changes in its legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [or those of its 
                                                       linked third parties and 
                                          (ii)         changes in the name, address, legal form, organisation type of its linked third parties;] 
                                    (b)  circumstances affecting: 
                                                 (i)  the decision to award the grant or 
                                                 (ii)  compliance with requirements under the Agreement. 
                           17.3               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Requests for information 
                         In  addition  to  the  specific  information  obligations  set  out  in  other  parts  of  the  GA  (e.g.  
                         Articles 22.1.2, 22.1.3 and 23), the Commission/Agency may request a beneficiary to provide any 
                         information it needs to verify that the beneficiary: 
                                     properly implemented the tasks described in Annex 1  
                                     complied with its obligations under the GA.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                 
                The  Commission/Agency  may  request  the  information  for  any  purpose  (e.g.  checks  for 
                monitoring  the  action  or  assessing  reports  and  requests  for  payment;  reviews;  audits; 
                investigations; evaluation of the action’s impact).  
                It may request any type of information it needs (including personal data, to order to verify 
                that costs declared for specific people are eligible; see Article 39). The level of detail will 
                depend on the purpose of the request. 
                The Commission/Agency may request the information at any time, either during the action or 
                afterwards.  
                    Examples: 
                    1. In an ex-post financial audit that starts 18 months after the balance is paid, the Commission/Agency may 
                    request any information it needs during the procedure. The audit may continue beyond the two years after 
                    the balance is paid (see Article 22). 
                    2. The Commission may request information from the beneficiaries in order to evaluate the action’s impact 
                    up to five years after the balance is paid (see Article 23). 
                    3. The beneficiaries must comply with any additional exploitation obligations set out in Annex 1, for up to 
                    four years after the action ends (see Article 3). They are therefore obliged to provide any information the 
                    Commission/Agency requests to verify that the action was correctly implemented and that the beneficiaries 
                    complied with their obligations under the GA. 
            The beneficiary concerned must provide accurate, precise and complete information, in the format 
            and within the deadline requested (see Article 22). 
                It is the coordinator who usually provides the information requested — unless the GA specifies 
                direct communication with the other beneficiaries (see Articles 20, 22, 23, 30, 41, 55).  
                If the coordinator no longer exists after the action ends (e.g. if it went bankrupt), beneficiaries 
                may provide the information requested directly to the Commission/Agency. 
            Until the balance is paid, all information is sent via the Funding & Tenders Portal. Afterwards, 
            information requests may have to be sent in writing by registered post with proof of delivery (see 
            Article 52). 
             
            2. Information in the Participant Register 
            Each beneficiary must keep its information in the Participant Register up-to-date, including after 
            the end of the grant. 
                      Updated information remains necessary both to contact the beneficiaries after the end of the action and 
                  if they want to participate in other EU grants.  
                   
                The information includes: 
                      .  name 
                        address 
                       legal representatives 
                       legal form (e.g. private limited liability company, public law body, S.A., S.L.) 
                       organisation type (e.g. SME, secondary or higher education establishment, etc.). 
                The  IT  system  automatically  informs  the  coordinator  whenever  a  beneficiary  updates  its 
                   
                information. 
                   
                     For more information on beneficiary registration, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.

            3. Information likely to delay or affect the action or EU financial interests 
            Each beneficiary must immediately inform the coordinator if an event is likely to significantly affect 
            or delay the action’s implementation or affect the EU financial interests. 
                    Examples (situation likely to significantly affect or delay the action’s implementation or affect 
                    the EU financial interests): a beneficiary is under financial stress and chooses to liquidate; a beneficiary 
                    is bought by another legal entity; a beneficiary plans to move its laboratory from a Member State to a non-
                    EU country 
                The beneficiaries must also inform the coordinator about any changes concerning their linked 
                third parties. 
                For events linked to changes that also require an update of the Participant Register (see 
                above), the beneficiary must update the Participant Register and inform the coordinator. 
                    The beneficiary must inform the coordinator offline, via its usual communication channels 
                    (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.).  
                    Best practice: It is recommended that the beneficiary informs the coordinator in writing (not 
                    only orally). 
            After receiving the information from the beneficiary, the coordinator must immediately inform: 
                   the Commission/Agency, via the Funding & Tenders Portal 
                   the other beneficiaries, through the usual communication channels (in writing and offline). 
             
            4. Information about circumstances affecting the decision to award the grant or 
               compliance with requirements under the GA 
            Each beneficiary must immediately inform the coordinator about any situation that: 
                   could have affected the decision to award the grant if it had been known by the evaluators 
                    at the time of evaluation or 
                   could affect the fulfilment of obligations under the GA. 
                Example (situation that could have affected the decision to award the grant or compliance with 
                requirements under the GA): A consortium has three beneficiaries. One of them has a laboratory with 
                specialised equipment and personnel, including a team of internationally-renowned experts in the same field as 
                the project. The quality of the work to be carried out by this laboratory was taken into account by the evaluators 
                when the grant was awarded. During the action’s implementation, the beneficiary sells the laboratory to an 
                external company, losing a good part of the relevant expertise, and as a result has to outsource part of the 
                work.

                           18.1               Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation 
                           The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default: five][OPTION 2 for low value grants38: 
                           three] years after the payment of the balance — keep records and other supporting documentation in order 
                            to prove the proper implementation of the action and the costs they declare as eligible. 
                          
                            They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                           investigations (see Article 22). 
                           If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                           Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
                            other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures. 
                           The beneficiaries must keep the original documents. Digital and digitalised documents are considered 
                           originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission][Agency] may accept non-
                            original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance.   
                           18.1.1 Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation 
                           The  beneficiaries  must  keep  records  and  other  supporting  documentation  on  scientific  and  technical 
                           implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field. 
                           18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support the costs declared 
                           The beneficiaries must keep the records and documentation supporting the costs declared, in particular the 
                           following: 
                                          (a)           for actual costs: adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the costs

                                                        the amounts stated in the supporting documentation;

                                                        documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount per unit.

                                                        accounting practices, the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation to 
                                                        prove that the cost accounting practices used comply with the conditions set out in Article 6.2. 
                                                        The beneficiaries [and linked third parties] may submit to the Commission, for approval, a

                                                        approved, costs declared in line with this methodology will not be challenged subsequently,

                In addition, for personnel costs (declared as actual costs or on the basis of unit costs), the beneficiaries 
                must keep time records for the number of hours declared. The time records must be in writing and approved 
                by the persons working on the action and their supervisors, at least monthly. In the absence of reliable time 
               records of the hours worked on the action, the [Commission][Agency] may accept alternative evidence 
                supporting the number of hours declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance. 
                As an exception, for persons working exclusively on the action, there is no need to keep time records, if 
               the beneficiary signs a declaration confirming that the persons concerned have worked exclusively on the 
                action.

                18.2     Consequences of non-compliance 
                If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be 
                ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42), and the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                
                38  For the definition,  see  Article  185 of  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of 
                    application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to 
                    the general budget of the Union (OJ L 362, 31.12.2012, p. 1) (‘Rules of Application Regulation No 1268/2012’): ‘low value grants’ 
                    are lower or equal to EUR 60 000. 
               
                        
              1. Records and other supporting documentation 
              The beneficiaries (for  linked third parties, see  point 10) must keep appropriate and sufficient 
              evidence to prove the eligibility of all the costs declared, proper implementation of the action and 
              compliance with all the other obligations under the GA. 
               
                        Costs  that  are  not  supported  by  appropriate  and  sufficient  evidence  may  be  rejected  (and  other 
                    measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well). 
                         . 
                  ‘Sufficiency’  relates  to  the  quantity  of  evidence;  ‘appropriateness’  relates  to  its  quality. 
                     
                  Evidence is considered sufficient and appropriate if it is persuasive enough for the auditors, 
                                                                                                 43

                      Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents will bear the full risk of cost rejection by the 
                   Commission/Agency. 
                       . 
            The  rules  in  the  GA  do  not  affect  national  laws  on  keeping  documents  (which  may  require 
                    
            additional measures). 
                    
                       . 
            2. Original documents 
                        
            The beneficiaries must keep original documents. 
                    
            The Commission/Agency will accept any document considered an original under national law. 
                    
                Examples: 
                    
                1. The Commission will accept authenticated copies or digitally-signed documents, if national law accepts these 
                as originals. 
                    
                2. The Commission will accept digitalised copies of documents (instead of hard copies), if this is acceptable 
                    
                under national law. 
            In principle, documents should be kept in the format in which they were received or created. 
                This means that: 
                       documents received or created in paper form should be kept in paper form 
                       documents received or created electronically should be kept in their electronic format. 
                        Hard copies of original electronic documents are not required. 
             
            3. Records for actual costs 
            For actual costs, the beneficiaries must: 
                   keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the eligibility of the costs 
                    declared 
                   use cost  accounting practices and internal  control  procedures that make it possible to 
                    verify that the amounts declared, amounts recorded in the accounts and amounts recorded 
                    in supporting documentation match up. 
            Best practice: The information included in the financial statements for each budget category (i.e. 
            personnel costs, other direct costs, indirect costs) must be broken down into details and must match 
            the amounts recorded in the accounts and in supporting documentation. 
                Examples: 
                1. For costs declared in category A.1 (employees or equivalent): the costs must be detailed for each person 
                carrying out work for the action (individual hourly rate multiplied by the actual hours worked for the action). 
                They must match the accounting records (i.e. general ledger transactions, annual financial statements) and 
                supporting documentation (i.e. labour contracts, collective labour agreements, applicable national law on taxes, 
                labour and social security contributions, payslips, time records, bank statements showing salary payments, 
                etc.). 
                2. For costs declared in category D.1, D.2, D.3 and D.4 (other direct costs): the beneficiary must keep a 
                breakdown of costs declared by type (i.e. travel costs and related subsistence allowances, depreciation, costs of 
                other goods and services etc.). It should be able to provide details of individual transactions for each type of 
                cost. For depreciation, it must be able to provide details per individual equipment used for the action. Declared 
                costs  must  match  accounting  records  (i.e.  general  ledger  transactions,  annual  financial  statements)  and 
                supporting documentation (i.e. purchase orders, delivery notes, invoices, contracts, bank statements, asset 
                usage logbook, depreciation policy, etc.).

            4. Records for unit costs set by the Commission 
            For unit costs, the beneficiaries must keep: 
                   detailed records and other supporting documents to prove the number of units declared. 
            It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred. 
            The  Commission/Agency may access the accounting records,  but  will  reject  costs  only  if  the 
            number of units declared is incorrect. (The actual costs of the work are not relevant).  
            If the Commission/Agency detects an irregularity or fraud in the action’s implementation, it may 
            reduce the grant. 
             
            5.  Records for unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual 
               cost accounting practices 
            For costs declared in accordance with their usual cost accounting practices (average personnel 
            costs  and  costs  of  internally  invoiced  goods  and  services),  the  beneficiaries  must  keep 
            detailed records and other supporting documents to: 
                   show that the costs used to calculate the unit cost match the actual costs as recorded in 
                    the statutory accounts 
                       Examples:  
                       1. For personnel costs: accounting records; financial statement extracts; labour contracts; collective 
                       labour agreements; applicable tax, labour and social security laws; pay slips; bank statements showing 
                       salary payments; classification of employees (based on experience, qualifications, salary, department, 
                       etc.). 
                       2. For internally invoiced goods and services: accounting records; financial statement extracts; time 
                       records  (or  other  records)  for  the  share  of  personnel  costs  included  in  the  unit  costs;  invoices  or 
                       contracts  for  maintenance  costs,  cleaning  costs,  other  services,  showing  that  the  cost  are  directly 
                       identifiable. 
                    Manual interventions into the accounting data must be traceable and documented. 
                   verify that the unit cost is free of ineligible cost components 
                       Examples:  
                       1.  For  personnel  costs:  records  that  show  that  the  hourly  rate  does  not  include  an  indirect  cost 
                       component (already covered by the 25 % flat rate); records that show that the hourly rate does not 
                       include travel costs (they should be claimed under category D.1 ‘travel’). 
                       2. For internally invoiced goods and services: evidence that shows that there is no profit/margin/mark-
                       up included in the internally invoiced goods and services (e.g. different rates: one for billing the activity, 
                       with mark-up, and another one for internal costing, free of any mark-up); lists of accounts/cost centres 
                       that were excluded from the calculation of internally invoiced goods and services — because already 
                       included in the costs claimed under another budget categories (e.g. LRI costs, indirect costs, in-kind 
                       contributions, etc.). 
                   assess the acceptability of budgeted and estimated elements 
                       Examples:  
                       1. For personnel costs: records that show the method for calculating the annual salary increases (e.g. 
                       consumer price index which, according to the beneficiary’s usual remuneration policy, serves as the 
                       basis for annual salary increases). 
                       2. For internally invoiced goods and services: traceable data used to determine the budgeted/ estimated 
                       elements; records on the nature and frequency of the updates of the budgeted and estimated elements; 
                       etc. 
                   for personnel costs: verify the number of productive hours used to calculate the unit cost 
                    (hourly rate)

                   for  internally  invoiced  goods  and  services:  verify  that  the  cost  items  used  for  the 
                    calculation of the unit cost were directly linked to the production of the invoiced good or 
                    service. 
                    Examples (not acceptable):  
                       1. Maintenance which goes beyond than the maintenance of the infrastructure/facilities used to produce 
                       the good/service (e.g. maintenance costs for all the beneficiary’s cleanrooms; maintenance costs for an 
                       entire building, while the cleanroom used for the good/service occupies only a part of the building). 
                       2.  Generic  supplies  for  which  there  is  no  evidence  that  they  were  directly  linked  to  the 
                       infrastructure/facilities  used  to  produce  the  good/service  (e.g.  electricity  costs  when  there  is  no 
                       electricity counter or technical specifications to measure the consumption). 
            By contrast, it is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred (per person/good or 
            service)  —  unless  they  are  needed  to  document  the  usual  cost  accounting  practices  (as  just 
            described). 
             
            6. Certificate on the methodology (CoMUC) 
            What?  To  get  additional  assurance,  a  beneficiary/linked  third  party  may  request  that  the 
            Commission/Agency confirms that its cost accounting practices for personnel costs comply with 
            the conditions set out in Article 6.2.A, by approving a certificate on its methodology (CoMUC). 
                Approval concerns the cost accounting practices described and certified in the certificate on 
                the methodology.  
                If the Commission/Agency approves the CoMUC, it will not challenge the personnel unit costs 
                (hourly rates) declared — unless information was concealed or fraud or corruption was used to 
                obtain approval (or another methodology was applied).  
                Approval is valid for all personnel costs declared according to these cost accounting practices, 
                including costs declared before the Commission/Agency approval (if the beneficiary can show 
                that they were declared according to the approved practices).  
                    Best practice: Beneficiaries should nevertheless keep detailed records and other supporting 
                    documents (to prove that their methodology complied with the rules, if necessary). 
                Approval  is  valid  for  all  H2020  grants  (i.e.  for  the  beneficiary’s  usual  cost  accounting 
                practices) and is not linked or limited to a specific grant. (It is NOT valid for FP7 grants and, 
                conversely an FP7 certificate is NOT valid for H2020.) 
            When? Beneficiaries may in principle submit their requests for approval at any time — before or 
            during the grant.  
                Best practice: In order to ensure that the auditor has enough information to get assurance on the 
                methodology, it is recommended to request it only after the first reporting period has passed. 
            If the beneficiary changes its cost accounting practices, it must obtain a new certificate and 
            submit a new request for approval to the Commission/Agency. 
                     
                          If  the  beneficiary  declares  personnel  costs  according  to  the  changed cost  accounting  practices 
                     before the new certificate is approved, it bears the full risk of non-approval and cost rejection by the 
                      Commission/Agency. 
                      
            How? The beneficiary must submit its certificate on the methodology to the Commission/Agency 
            (via         the          following         address:           EC-H2020-UNIT-COST-METHODOLOGY-
            CERTIFICATION@ec.europa.eu). The certificate should be drawn up by an independent auditor 
                         . 
            using the template in Annex 6 of the GA (or an independent public officer, if the beneficiary is a 
            public body).

            7. Records for flat-rate costs 
            For flat-rate costs, the beneficiaries must: 
                   keep detailed records and other supporting documents to prove that the costs to which the 
                    flat rate is applied are eligible. 
                       Example: For the flat rate of 25 % of indirect costs, the auditors will verify (and the beneficiaries must 
                       be able to show) that: 
                           a)  the  actual  direct  costs  are  eligible,  using  the  detailed  records  and  supporting  documents 
                               explained above;  
                           b)  the following costs were excluded: subcontracting costs, the costs of resources made available 
                               by third parties not used on the beneficiary’s premises and financial support to third parties 
                               from the pool of actual direct eligible costs to which the flat rate applies. 
            It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred. 
                 
            8. Records for lump sum costs 
            For lump sum costs, the beneficiaries must: 
                   keep  detailed  records  and  other  supporting  documents  to  prove  that  the  action  tasks 
                    described in Annex 1 have been carried out in accordance with the GA. 
            It is NOT necessary to keep records on the actual costs incurred. 
             
            9. Records for personnel costs — Hours worked for the action 
            The records for personnel costs depend on whether the person worked exclusively for the action or 
            not. 
             
                      For H2020, exclusive work or not matters only for the record-keeping. It has NO impact on the 
                  calculation of the costs to be declared (— in both cases they must be calculated through an hourly rate, 
                  monthly or per full financial year, etc.; see Article 6.2.A). 
                   
                   
            For persons who work exclusively for the action (regardless if they are full-time or part-time 
            employees), the beneficiary may either: 
                      . 
                  sign  a  declaration  on  exclusive  work  for  the  action  [ODT  format]  (one  per  reporting 
                       
                    period), to confirm that the person worked exclusively for the action, either: 
                   
                           during the whole reporting period  
                   
                        or 
                           during an uninterrupted time-period, covering at least a full calendar month within 
                            the reporting period.  
                        Best practice: Beneficiaries should take a prudent approach and use this possibility only if 
                        it is planned that the person works exclusively on the action during a long and continuous 
                        period of time. If there are any doubts, a record of actual hours worked should be kept (e.g. 
                        time-sheets). 
                    ‘Exclusive work’ means that the person carried out NO OTHER activities for the beneficiary 
                    than those of the action.  
                        Intermittent (i.e.  sporadic or random) periods of ‘exclusive’ dedication can NOT be 
                        subject  of  a  declaration.  If  a  person  worked  randomly  for  the  action  after  an 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18                                                            178 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                        uninterrupted time-period covered by a declaration, time-sheets are needed for the 
                        period of random work. 
                                Example: The person worked for the action exclusively from 15/02 to 31/05 and then worked 
                                again in the action some days in July and October and the full month of November. The 
                                declaration will cover the period from 15/02 to 31/05 and time records must be kept for the 
                                time the person worked for the action in July, October and November. 
                        If a person worked under different regimes during the reporting period (exclusive and 
                        non-exclusive), the declaration may be used ONLY for a period of exclusive work. The 
                        other months must be recorded with time-sheets.  
                        If  there  were  several  periods  of  exclusive  work  during  one  reporting  period,  the 
                        beneficiary may choose to use the declaration for the longest one (and use the monthly 
                        time-sheets for the others).  
                    The  declaration  must  be  dated  and  signed  by  the  person  concerned  AND  her/his 
                    supervisor.  
                  keep time records.  
                    Best practice: If the person works exclusively for the action during a full financial year, it is 
                    strongly recommended that the beneficiary signs the ‘declaration on exclusive work for the 
                    action’ (— even if the person keeps time records). In this way, the declaration can serve as 
                    evidence that the person worked for the action all her/his annual productive hours. 
            For persons who do NOT work exclusively for the action, the beneficiaries must: 
                   show the actual hours worked, with reliable time records (i.e. time-sheets) either on 
                    paper or in a computer-based time recording system.  
                    Time records must be dated and signed at least monthly by the person working for the 
                    action and his/her supervisor. 
                    If  the  time recording system is computer-based, the signatures may be electronic (i.e. 
                    linking  the  electronic  identity  data  (e.g.  a  password  and  user  name)  to  the  electronic 
                    validation data, with a documented and secure process for managing user rights and an 
                    auditable log of all electronic transactions). 
                    Time records should include, as a minimum: 
                           the title and number of the action, as specified in the GA 
                           the beneficiary’s full name, as specified in the GA 
                           the full name, date and signature of the person working for the action 
                           the number of hours worked for the action in the period covered by the time record  
                           the supervisor’s full name and signature 
                           a reference to the action tasks or work packages of Annex 1, to which the person 
                            has contributed by the reported working hours.   
                        Information included in time-sheets must match records of annual leave, sick leave, 
                        other leaves and work-related travel. 
                        A  template  [ODT  format]  for  time-sheets  with  these  minimum  requirements  is 
                        available. (This template is not mandatory; beneficiaries may use their own model, 
                        provided that it fulfils the minimum conditions and it contains at least the information 
                        detailed above.)  
                If time records are not reliable, the Commission/Agency may exceptionally accept alternative 
                evidence if it proves the number of hours worked on the action with a similar (or at least 
                satisfactory) level of assurance (assessed against generally-accepted audit standards). 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 18                                                            179 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                          The Commission/Agency has full discretion to accept or refuse the alternative evidence and there is 
                      no entitlement to it. Beneficiaries that rely on alternative evidence bear the full risk of refusal and 
                     rejection of costs by the Commission/Agency. 
                       
                    Examples  of  possible  alternative  evidence  (non-exhaustive  list):  travel  documents  proving 
                         . 
                    participation in a project meeting (boarding pass, obliterated travel ticket, hotel invoice, etc.); agenda and 
                    minutes  of  the  meeting;  attendance  lists;  working  papers;  laboratory  log  books;  professional/personal 
                          
                    diaries; documents related to presentations; scientific publications; correspondence such as letters, notes, 
                    memos, emails; etc.  
                      
                    The auditors will use the following three criteria to assess how credible the alternative 
                      
                    evidence is: 
                       1.  Clear identification of the person concerned 
                       2.  Clear link to the project under scrutiny 
                       3.  Possibility to quantify time spent on project-related tasks. 
                        Alternative evidence will only be accepted if these three criteria are met.  
                        Example (acceptable alternative evidence): 
                        A researcher submits the following email as alternative evidence: ‘I hereby send you the results of the 
                        analysis of project XYZ that I have been working on for the last two weeks.’ 
                        Criterion 1 is met – the sender of the email is the person concerned 
                        Criterion 2 is met – the project is identified as XYZ 
                        Criterion 3 is met – the time is quantified: two weeks 
                        Example (not acceptable alternative evidence): 
                        A beneficiary submits the following email as alternative evidence: ‘I hereby send you the results of the 
                        analysis recently carried out by my team.’ 
                        Criterion  1  is  not  met  –  it  is  unclear  who  the  person  concerned  is;  the  team  members  and  their 
                        contributions are unknown 
                        Criterion 2 is not met: the project name is not mentioned 
                        Criterion 3 is not met – the time is not quantified 
             
            10. Records of (linked) third parties 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that linked third parties comply with the same obligations in 
            terms of keeping appropriate and sufficient evidence. 
                Example: Linked third parties that carry out work themselves must document all their costs in the same way 
                the beneficiaries do. However, it is the beneficiary who must keep the original financial statements and the 
                certificates on financial statements of the linked third parties. 
            The beneficiaries must also ensure that they keep appropriate and sufficient evidence related to 
            third parties that made in-kind contributions and to subcontractors. 
                Examples: 
                1. The beneficiaries must keep evidence of third parties’ actual direct costs if there are in-kind contributions, 
                either  free  of  charge  or  against  payment.  Alternatively,  they  may  ensure  that  the  third  parties  keep  the 
                evidence. 
                2. The beneficiaries must keep evidence showing that subcontractors fulfilled their obligations in terms of the 
                visibility of EU funding. Alternatively, they may ensure that the subcontractors keep this evidence. 
            For international partners, beneficiaries must keep appropriate and sufficient evidence ONLY on 
            scientific and technical implementation of the action. Beneficiaries are not required to prove the 
            costs of the international partners, since the latter do not receive EU funding (see Article 14a).     
            Specific case (records of linked third parties):  
            Financial statements and certificates on the financial statements (CFS) — It is the beneficiary 
            that must keep the originals of the financial statements and the certificates on the financial statements 
            of the linked third parties.

                         ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES 
                           ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES 
                           19.1               Obligation to submit deliverables 
                           The coordinator must submit the ‘deliverables’ identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and 
                           conditions set out in it. 
                           19.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the [Commission][Agency] may apply 
                            any of the measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                             
                                            
                         1. Deliverables 
                         What & When? The coordinator must submit the deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance 
                         with the timing and conditions set out in that Annex. 
                                  ‘Deliverables’  are  additional  outputs  (e.g.  information,  special  report,  a  technical  diagram 
                                  brochure,  list,  a  software  milestone  or  other  building  block  of  the  action)  that  must  be 
                                  produced  at  a  given  moment  during  the  action  (normally  not  at  the  same  time  as  the 
                                  periodic/final reports).  
                                  ‘Milestones’ are, by contrast, control points in the action that help to chart progress. They may 
                                  correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to 
                                  begin or be needed at intermediary points. 
                         The deliverables that must be produced are listed in Annex 1 of the GA. 
                                  Example: For actions under Part III, ‘Secure, clean and efficient energy’ involving energy efficiency measures in 
                                  buildings, the beneficiaries must deliver a ‘handover certificate’ at the same time as their periodic reports. This 
                                  certificate must prove the actual specifications of the buildings constructed or refurbished, their surface area and 
                                  address. It must be signed by a member of the consortium.  
                         For deliverables that are not in writing (e.g. cell line or prototype), the beneficiaries must submit a 
                         short written description. 
                         How? The coordinator must upload them directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal.  
                                    Security obligations — If the deliverables contain EU classified information, the coordinator must first 
                              contact the Commission/Agency to discuss how to submit them (approval needed; see Article 37).  
                                     For more guidance on security obligations, see the Guidelines for the handling of classified information in EU 
                              research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.

                           20.1               Obligation to submit reports 
                           The coordinator must submit to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52) the technical and financial 
                           reports set out in this Article. These reports include the requests for payment and must be drawn up using 
                             the forms and templates provided in the electronic exchange system (see Article 52). 
                          
                             20.2             Reporting periods 
                          
                           The action is divided into the following ‘reporting periods’: 
                                                  - RP1: from month 1 to month [X]

                                                  - RP3: from month [Y+1] to month [Z] 
                                                  [same for other RPs] 
                                                  - RPN: from month [N+1]to [the last month of the project].] 
                           20.3               Periodic reports — Requests for interim payments 
                           The coordinator must submit a periodic report within 60 days following the end of each reporting period. 
                           The periodic report must include the following: 
                                  (a)  a ‘periodic technical report’ containing: 
                                                  (i)           an explanation of the work carried out by the beneficiaries; 
                                                 (ii)           an overview of the progress towards the objectives of the action, including milestones and 
                                                                deliverables identified in Annex 1.

                             linked third party], for the reporting period concerned. 
                             The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs 
                             and flat-rate costs [and lump sum costs]; see Article 6) for each budget category (see 
                             Annex 2). 
                             The beneficiaries [and linked third parties] must declare all eligible costs, even if — for 
                             actual costs, unit costs and flat-rate costs — they exceed the amounts indicated in the 
                             estimated  budget  (see  Annex  2).  Amounts  which  are  not  declared  in  the  individual 
                             financial statement will not be taken into account by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                             If  an  individual  financial  statement  is  not  submitted  for  a  reporting  period,  it  may  be 
                             included in the periodic financial report for the next reporting period. 
                             The  individual  financial  statements  of  the  last  reporting  period  must  also  detail  the 
                             receipts of the action (see Article 5.3.3). 
                             Each beneficiary [and each linked third party] must certify that: 
                                 -   the information provided is full, reliable and true; 
                                 -   the costs declared are eligible (see Article 6); 
                                 -   the costs can be substantiated by adequate records and supporting documentation 
                                     (see Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the 
                                     context of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 22), and 
                                 -   for the last reporting period: that all the receipts have been declared (see Article 
                                     5.3.3); 
                      (ii)   an explanation of the use of resources and the information on subcontracting (see Article 
                             13) and in-kind contributions provided by third parties (see Articles 11 and 12) from each 
                             beneficiary [and from each linked third party], for the reporting period concerned; 
                      (iii)  [OPTION 1 if the JRC is a beneficiary: information on the amount of each interim 
                             payment and payment of the balance to be paid by the [Commission][Agency] to the Joint

                             exchange system, consolidating the individual financial statements for the reporting period 
                             concerned and including — except for the last reporting period — the request for interim 
                             payment. 
              20.4   Final report — Request for payment of the balance 
              In addition to the periodic report for the last reporting period, the coordinator must submit the final report 
             within 60 days following the end of the last reporting period. 
              The final report must include the following: 
                (a)  a ‘final technical report’ with a summary for publication containing:

                                 each beneficiary [and for each linked third party], if it requests a total contribution of EUR 
                                 325 000 or more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the basis of 
                                 its usual cost accounting practices (see Article 5.2 and Article 6.2). 
               20.5     Information on cumulative expenditure incurred 
                                                                                                             39

               [Commission][Agency] by [31 December][30 November] each year of the cumulative expenditure incurred 
               by the beneficiaries from the starting date of the action. 
               This information is required for the Commission’s accounting purposes and will not be used to calculate the 
               final grant amount.] 
               [OPTION 2 : Not applicable] 
               20.6     Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro 
               Financial statements must be drafted in euro. 
               Beneficiaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in a currency other than the euro must 
               convert the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in 
               the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, calculated over the corresponding reporting 
               period. 
               If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal of the European Union for the currency in 
               question,  they  must  be  converted  at  the  average  of  the  monthly  accounting  rates  published  on  the 
               Commission’s website, calculated over the corresponding reporting period. 
               Beneficiaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in euro must convert costs incurred in 
               another currency into euro according to their usual accounting practices. 
               20.7     Language of reports 
               All  reports  (technical  and  financial  reports,  including  financial  statements)  must  be  submitted  in  the 
               language of the Agreement. 
              
               20.8     Consequences of non-compliance  
              
               If  the  reports  submitted  do  not  comply  with  this  Article,  the  [Commission][Agency]  may  suspend  the 
               payment deadline (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
               If the coordinator breaches its obligation to submit the reports and if it fails to comply with this obligation 
               within 30 days following a written reminder the [Commission][Agency] may terminate the Agreement  (see 
               Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

            1. Reports 
            What & When? In order to receive payments, the beneficiaries (and their linked third parties) 
            must report on the (technical and financial) implementation of the action (reporting). 
             
                    These reports must be distinguished from deliverables (that are part of Annex 1; see Article 19) and 
                milestones (part of Annex 1, but not covered by Article 19 or 20). 
                 
            The coordinator must submit a periodic report after the end of each reporting period (including 
                 
            the final one). 
                    . 
            Each report should be seen as a single package, composed of several parts, i.e.:  
                     
                   a technical report  
                 
                    The periodic technical report includes an explanation of work carried out, an overview of 
                    progress, a publishable summary and a questionnaire. 
                    The final technical report is a publishable summary of the entire action (describing the 
                    overview of the results and their exploitation and dissemination, the conclusions on the 
                    action and its socio-economic impact). 
                 
                   a financial report. 
                    The periodic financial report includes the individual financial statements, an explanation of 
                    the use of resources and the periodic summary financial statement. 
                    The  final  financial  report  consists  of  the  final  summary  financial  statement  that  is 
                    automatically  generated  by  the  IT  system.  In  some  cases  (and  for  some 
                    beneficiaries/linked third parties) it must be accompanied by a certificate on the financial 
                    statements (CFS; one certificate per beneficiary/linked third party). 
                    The financial reports also contain the requests for payment (necessary for any payment 
                    other than the pre-financing payment). 
            Costs related to reporting may be eligible (see Article 6.2.D.3). 
            If the coordinator breaches its obligation to submit the reports, the Commission/Agency may 
            suspend the payment deadline and — if not remedied after a written reminder — terminate the GA 
            or take any of the other Chapter 6 measures (e.g. cost rejection, grant reduction, recovery of 
            payments already made, etc.; see Articles 42-44, 47-50). 
                The GA will not be terminated if the breach concerns the last reporting period (because the 
                action duration is already over). 
            How?  The  report(s)  must  be  prepared  by  the  coordinator  and  the  other  beneficiaries 
            together (directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal Continuous and Periodic Reporting Modules). 
                    List of documents for the periodic reports: 
                           explanation of the work carried out (periodic reporting - part B technical report) 
                           overview of the progress (periodic reporting - part B technical report) 
                           updated plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results (if necessary) (periodic 
                            reporting - part B technical report) 
                           summary for publication (continuous reporting) 
                           answers to the questionnaire (continuous reporting)

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                           individual financial statements for each beneficiary and linked party (periodic reporting - 
                            financial report) 
                           explanation of the use of resources (periodic reporting - financial report) 
                           summary financial statement (generated automatically by the IT system) 
                           information on amounts to be paid to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) (if necessary). 
                    List of documents for the final report: 
                           final summary for publication (generated automatically by the IT system) 
                           final summary financial statement (generated automatically by the IT system) 
                           certificates on the financial statements (CFS) (if necessary). 
                Generally, they can be prepared together (i.e. by several users from different beneficiaries), 
                via the Funding & Tenders Portal Continuous and Periodic Reporting Modules. The parts in the 
                continuous reporting can be filled out at any moment in time (continuously open) and are 
                then automatically added into the periodic report by the IT system (part A of the technical 
                report  with  the  questionnaire  and    the  summary  for  publication;  consolidated  financial 
                statement). Other parts are opened only at periodic reporting (part B of the technical report, 
                individual financial statements, explanation of the use of resources).  Data is cross-linked to 
                avoid duplication of data input (e.g. the financial statement and the explanation on the use of 
                resources are linked: for each cost declared in the financial statement, a box will pop up 
                asking  the  beneficiary  to  give  an  explanation  of  the  cost,  link  it  to  the  relevant  work 
                package(s) and justify the expense, if necessary; the final report is completely automatized: 
                assembled on the basis of elements from the periodic report). 
                    Individual financial statements must be filled out by each beneficiary (individually), 
                    and then signed and formally submitted to the coordinator (directly  in  the  Funding  & 
                    Tenders Portal).  
                        This includes the coordinator, who must also submit the individual financial statement 
                        for itself.  
                        For linked third parties, the financial statements must be filled out and submitted by 
                        their beneficiary (since the linked third parties cannot sign them in the IT system).  
                               Before submission, the beneficiary must complete the data for the linked third 
                               party (based on the information it received from the linked third party). The 
                               beneficiary then prints the financial statement and sends it to the linked third 
                               party,  for  signature  (on  paper)  and  return  (by  registered  post  with  proof  of 
                               delivery).  The  beneficiary  must ensure that the data encoded is correct (i.e. 
                               identical to the signed paper version). 
                             
                                  Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its 
                              files (see Article 18.1.2). 
                               
                        If a beneficiary cannot submit its individual financial statement on time, the report can 
                                  . 
                        be submitted without this financial statement. The costs will be considered zero 
                        for this reporting period, but the beneficiary can declare its costs with the next financial 
                                   
                        report (for the next reporting period).  
                               
                           The coordinator will be asked to confirm the non-submission, when submitting the 
                               
                           report. 
                               
                        If a beneficiary fails to submit its financial statement for the last reporting period, the 
                        Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline (see Article 47). 
                               
                    The  certificates  on  the  financial  statements  (CFS)  must  be  submitted  (by  the 
                               
                    coordinator)  as  scanned  copy  (PDF)  together  with  the  financial  statement  for  the  last 
                    reporting period of the beneficiary concerned.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                 
                            Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the originals for itself and its linked third parties 
                         in its files (see Article 18.1.2). 
                          
            When all parts are ready, the report(s) are assembled automatically by the IT system and must be 
                             . 
            submitted by the coordinator (as a single package; single submission).  
                              
                When a report is submitted, the other beneficiaries are automatically informed by the system. 
                          
                If  the  Commission/Agency considers the report incomplete or not in compliance with the 
                          
                conditions of this Article, it will suspend the payment deadline (see Article 47). 
                          
                    In this case, the Commission/Agency will send back the report to the coordinator, as a 
                    single package, together with a notification letter that explains the reasons and requests 
                          
                    modifications  and/or  clarification(s)  (suspension  of  the  payment  deadline).  The 
                    coordinator (CoCo) must then re-submit the corrected report, as a single package, within 
                          
                    the deadline specified (single re-submission). 
                        The re-submission re-starts the payment deadline (remaining time, taking account of 
                        the time used before suspension).  
                     
                           Adjustments of financial statements (exceptional) — If the beneficiaries notice a mistake 
                      (e.g. incorrect accounting information; error in the calculation; etc), they can make an adjustment 
                      (positive or negative) in the following reporting period to the financial statements for any previous 
                      reporting period. 
                          Example: An internal audit on the annual accounts of the beneficiary finds later errors in the accounting 
                          information used to calculate the hourly rates.  
                      Otherwise, costs that have already been declared can normally NOT be adjusted/changed (e.g. to take 
                      into account of a different hourly rate after the closure of the financial year).  
             
             
            2. Reporting periods  
            Each action is divided into reporting periods. 
            The length of the reporting periods is set out in the GA. As a general rule, reporting periods last 
            18 months. 
            The number of reporting periods is also set out in the GA, and depends on the action duration. 
            Normally it is determined as follows: 
             
                                                  Duration in     Max. number of 
                                                   months             periods 
                                                    1 to 18              1 
                                                   19 to 36              2 
                                                   37 to 54              3 
                                                   55 to 72              4 
                                                   73 to 90              5

            3.  Technical  report:  Explanation  of  the  work  carried  out  —  Overview  of  the 
               progress — Summary for publication — Questionnaire 
            The explanation of the work carried out and the overview of the progress should show how 
            the  action  is  being  implemented  and  what  has  already  been  achieved  (as  compared  to  the 
            objectives, milestones and deliverables described in Annex 1). 
                The coordinator must check if all deliverables due for the period have been submitted. If work 
                planned was not carried out, the beneficiaries must explain why. 
                The  overview  of  the  progress  must  also  describe  how  achieved  results  are  exploited  and 
                disseminated and include an updated plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the 
                results (if such a plan is foreseen in Annex 1). 
                For grants signed after GA version 3.0, the overview of the progress must also indicate the 
                communication activities carried out by the consortium (see also Article 38.1).  
                 
                          Security obligations — Technical reports may NOT contain any information that has been EU-
                       classified in Annex 1 of the GA (see Article 37). 
                           For  more  guidance  on  security  obligations,  see  the  Guidelines  for  the  handling  of  classified 
                       information in EU research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                        
                 
            The summary must give a brief description of the action, presenting its objectives and the results 
            achieved (in an easy-to-read way, understandable for a non-specialist audience). 
                The summary must be fit for publication, so that the Commission/Agency can publish it on 
                its website right away. 
                    If  needed,  the  Commission/Agency may make changes to the summary and publish it 
                    (after having given the coordinator the opportunity to comment). 
                The coordinator  must  ensure  that  none  of  the  material  submitted  for  publication  includes 
                confidential (or EU-classified) information. 
                For the last reporting period: The summary should present an overview of the results, their 
                exploitation  and  dissemination,  the  action’s  conclusions  and  its  socio-economic  impact 
                (because it will be directly re-used for the final report). 
            The questionnaire must be filled out to provide the Commission/Agency with regular up-to-date 
            information for monitoring the action (and ultimately the H2020 Programme). 
                The questionnaire consists in structured information on: 
                          performance indicators (defined in Annex II to the H2020 Specific Programme) 
                          information to monitor the implementation of H2020 on cross–cutting issues (see 
                           Annex III to the Specific Programme) and to assess the progress of Horizon 2020 
                           against the objectives defined for the ‘societal challenges’ (see Article 3 and Annex 
                           I to the Specific Programme). 
            It is designed in a modular way, consisting as much as possible of structured questions, by topic 
            (e.g. publications, patents, innovation, etc.).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            4.  Financial  report:  Individual  financial statements  — Explanation of the use of 
               resources  —  Summary  financial  statement  —  Certificates  on  the  financial 
               statements (CFS) 
            The individual financial statements (see Annex 4) must contain all costs that: 
                    were incurred by the beneficiary/linked third parties during the reporting period  
                AND 
                    fulfil the eligibility conditions set out in Article 6. 
                 
                     Beneficiaries/linked third parties should declare ALL their eligible costs — even if they are above the 
                 estimated budget in Annex 2 (cost overruns). The grant will be capped at the maximum grant amount, but 
                 cost overruns may turn out useful, if the Commission/Agency should reject some of the costs (at payment or 
                  later on). 
                   
                Beneficiaries may declare costs incurred during a previous reporting period, if they were not 
                  
                declared before. 
                  
                The  costs  of  linked  third  parties  must  NOT  be  included  in  the  beneficiary’s  financial 
                     . 
                statements; linked third parties must fill out their own financial statements. 
                      
                For the last reporting period, beneficiaries also have to declare the receipts for the action (see 
                Article 5.3.3). 
                  
                  
                        Combining different EU grants — Beneficiaries that have action grants and operating grants 
                    may claim indirect costs in their action grants ONLY if they are able to demonstrate cost separation (i.e. 
                    that their operating grants do not cover any costs which are covered by their action grants). 
                    To demonstrate cost separation, the following conditions must be fulfilled: 
                           the operating grants may NOT cover 100% of the beneficiary’s annual budget (i.e. it may not 
                            be full operating grants)  
                           the beneficiary must use analytical accounting which allows for a cost accounting management 
                            with cost allocation keys and cost accounting codes AND must apply these keys and codes to 
                            identify and separate the costs (i.e. to allocate them to either the action grant activities or the 
                            operating grant activities)   
                           the beneficiary must record:  
                                   all real costs incurred for the activities that are covered by their operating grants (i.e. 
                                    personnel, general running costs and other operating costs linked to the WP) and  
                                   all  real  costs  incurred  for  the  activities  that  are  covered  by  their  action  grants 
                                    (including the indirect costs linked to the action) 
                           the allocation of the costs must be done in a way that leads to a fair, objective and realistic 
                            result. 
                    Beneficiaries that cannot fulfil these conditions must EITHER: 
                           not sign/terminate the operating grants, in order to be able to claim indirect costs in the action 
                            grants 
                           keep the operating grants, but sign the action grants without indirect costs or request no 
                            indirect costs at reporting stage (i.e. lower the pre-filled amount in the indirect cost column of 
                            the financial statement). 
                    The possibility to combine operating grants with action grants if costs are separated was introduced 
                    with GA version 4.0. It applies also to older grant agreements, if the beneficiaries can demonstrate that 
                    there is no double funding, in accordance with the above-listed principles (analytical accounting tools, 
                    full cost recording, fair allocation). 
                    Best practice: In case of overlapping EU action and operating grants, the beneficiary should immediately 
                    contact the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal). Be aware that operating grants are not 
                    always easy to identify. They exist under various labels (operating grants; financial contributions/support to 
                    the functioning/operation of entities; etc.). Check your call text.

             EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                General MGA 
             The explanation of the use of resources must be consistent with the costs declared in the 
             financial statement per beneficiary.  
             For the final reporting period, some beneficiaries/linked third parties will also have to submit a 
             certificate on the financial statement (CFS). 
                 Such a certificate  is  needed  if  the  beneficiary/linked  third  party  requests  a  total  financial 
                 contribution  of  EUR  325 000  (or  more)  as  reimbursement  for  actual  costs  and  unit  costs 
                 calculated according to its usual accounting practices (average personnel costs and costs for 
                 internally invoiced goods and services).  
                      This means that costs based on lump sums, flat-rates (e.g. indirect costs) or unit costs 
                      (other than those for personnel costs and costs for internally invoiced goods and services 
                      calculated according to the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices) are NOT counted 
                      for the EUR 325 000 threshold (and do not need to be covered by the certificate). 
                          Example: 
                          A is a beneficiary in an action which declared the following total eligible costs for the action: 
                                  personnel costs according to  usual accounting practices           =         EUR 250 000 
                                  subcontracting costs                                               =         EUR 40 000 
                                  depreciation costs of equipment used to carry out the action       =         EUR 60 000 
                                  indirect costs (25 % flat rate)                                    =         EUR 77 500 
                                  total eligible costs claimed by A                                  =        EUR 427 500 
                          The reimbursement rate is 100%. 
                          As the amount of eligible actual costs and personnel costs according to usual accounting practices 
                          incurred by A (and hence the requested financial contribution) is higher than EUR 325 000, A must 
                          submit a CFS for the following costs: 
                                                Direct      Subcontracting     Other direct                       Total costs 
                               Type of cost   personnel         costs             costs        Indirect costs   covered by the 
                                                costs                                                                CFS 
                                  Costs        250 000          40 000           60 000             0              350 000 
                               covered by 
                                 the CFS 
                  
                      If  a  certificate  is  required,  all  costs  declared  as  actual  costs  or  unit  costs  calculated 
                      according to usual accounting practices must be covered by the certificate. Incomplete 
                      certificates will be returned for correction.  
                          However, costs previously audited by the Commission/Agency are NOT counted for the 
                          EUR 325 000 threshold and they do not need to be covered (again) by the certificate). 
                      Linked  third  parties  must  submit  a  certificate  if  it  reaches  (on  its  own,  without  its 
                      beneficiary) the EUR 325 000 threshold. 
                      Certificates submitted before the EUR 325 000 threshold is reached will be rejected by the 
                      Commission/Agency. 
                 Beneficiaries/linked third parties may submit either one certificate per reporting period or 
                 a single CFS for the whole action.  
                      The certificate(s) may be submitted ONLY with the final financial report. Certificates 
                      submitted at any other moment will NOT be accepted (and costs incurred for them will be 
                      considered ineligible, because not necessary).  
                       
                      Costs for partial certificates (i.e. one certificate per reporting period) will be accepted ONLY 
                      in the last reporting period and ONLY if: 
                              a CFS is mandatory (i.e. the threshold is reached at the end of the action) and 
                              the total costs of the partial certificates is similar to the cost that would have been 
                               incurred for a single certificate.

                               Only qualified auditors may issue a certificate. 
                                      ‘Qualified’  means  qualified  in  accordance  with  national  legislation  implementing 
                                                                           44
                                      Directive 2006/43/EC  (or any EU legislation that replaces this Directive).  
                               The auditor must certify that the costs declared in the financial statement are accurately 
                               recorded in the beneficiary’s accounting system and eligible. 
                                      If the auditor cannot confirm (for any reason), s/he must explain this in detail in the 
                                      certificate. The Commission/Agency will consider the explanation in light of the facts 
                                      provided by the auditor, and decide on steps to take. 
                  The  summary  financial  statement  is  generated  automatically  by  the  IT  system  (with 
                  consolidated  data  from  all  individual  financial  statements  for  all  beneficiaries  and  linked  third 
                  parties, for the reporting period). 
                  For  the  final  reporting  period,  the  IT  system  will  also  generate  a  final  summary  financial 
                  statement (consolidating the data from all individual financial statements for all beneficiaries and 
                  linked third parties, for all reporting periods). 
                   
                  Specific cases (certificates on the financial statements): 
                  Public bodies — For public bodies, the certificate may be issued by an independent public officer with 
                  formal competence to audit the beneficiary/linked third party (instead of by an external auditor). 
                  International  organisations  —  For  international  organisations,  it  can  be  an  internal  or  external 
                  auditor that is appointed in accordance with the internal financial regulations and procedures of the 
                  organisation. 
                  Beneficiaries/linked  third  parties  from  a  third  country  —  Beneficiaries/linked  third  parties 
                  established in a non-EU country must provide a certificate that complies with national regulations in the 
                  field.  Auditors  qualified  in  the  EU  may  provide  certificates  for  beneficiaries  established  in  non-EU 
                  countries, if they are familiar with the relevant national regulations (national accounting rules) and 
                  comply with them when preparing the certification. 
                   
                  5. Information on cumulative expenditure incurred 
                  This option will be inserted in the GA for grants above EUR 5 million, for which pre-financing is 
                  paid and where the reporting period for interim payments or payment of the balance exceeds 18 
                  months. 
                  A  template  is  available  and  must  be  submitted  via  the  Funding  &  Tenders  Portal  Continuous

                                            European  Union  for  the  currency  in  question:  using  the  average  of  the  daily 
                                            exchange rates published over the corresponding reporting period. 
                                            For cost adjustments to previous periods (‘adjustment financial statements’), the 
                                            exchange rate to be used is the one for the reporting period in which the costs 
                                            adjusted were incurred. 
                                            For eligibile cost related to drafting and submitting the final reports incurred after 
                                            the action duration, the exchange rate to be used is the one for the last reporting

                                                   Step 4 —   Insert the starting date of the reporting period in the field ‘from’ and the 
                                                                     end date of the reporting period in the field ‘to’. The average for the

                                                   incurred in RON during this period are RON 500 000. The university will convert its costs into 
                                                   euros at the average rate of RON 4 .4274 for EUR 1 (established following the steps mentioned 
                                                   above). The university will report costs of EUR 112 933, 10 (RON 500 000 / RON 4 .4274 * EUR

                                            Example: A Moldovan university with accounting in Moldovan Lei (MDL) is the beneficiary of a GA 
                                            with one reporting period, from 24.01.2013 to 23.01.2014. The costs incurred in MDL during this 
                                            period are MDL 500 000. The university will calculate the average of the 13 monthly exchange 
                                            rates (January 2013 until January 2014) published on the Commission’s website. This average rate 
                                            is MDL 16,.7531 for EUR 1. The university will report costs of EUR 29  845,22 (MDL 500 000 / MDL

                           The following payments will be made to the coordinator: 
                                      -        one pre-financing payment; 
                                      -        one or more interim payments, on the basis of the request(s) for interim payment (see Article 20), 
                                               and 
                                      -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
                                               20). 
                           21.2                Pre-financing payment — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund 
                           The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
                           It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
                           The amount of the pre-financing payment will be EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)].  
                           The [Commission][Agency] will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre-financing payment to the 
                              coordinator within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 
                           days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest.  
                           An amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
                              amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the [Commission][Agency] from the pre-financing payment and 
                           transferred into the ‘Guarantee Fund’ 
                           [OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary: Moreover, the part of the pre-financing payment related to the Joint 
                           Research Centre (JRC) ([insert amount (insert amount in words)] is not paid to the coordinator, but kept 
                              by the [Commission][Agency] for the JRC.] 
                           21.3                Interim payments — Amount — Calculation 
                           Interim payments reimburse the eligible costs incurred for the implementation of the action during the 
                           corresponding reporting periods. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will pay to the coordinator the amount due as interim payment within 90 days 
                              from receiving the periodic report (see Article 20.3), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                           Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report. Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
                           compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content. 
                           The amount due as interim payment is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] in the following steps: 
                                      Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates 
                                      Step 2 — Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount 
                           21.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates  
                           The reimbursement rate(s) (see Article 5.2) are applied to the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs and 
                           flat-rate costs [and lump sum costs]; see Article 6) declared by the beneficiaries [and the linked third 
                              parties]  (see  Article  20)  and  approved  by  the  [Commission][Agency]  (see  above)  for  the  concerned

              21.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount 
              The total amount of pre-financing and interim payments must not exceed 90% of the maximum grant 
              amount set out in Article 5.1. The maximum amount for the interim payment will be calculated as follows:  
                      {90% of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1)  
                      minus 
                      {pre-financing and previous interim payments}}. 
              21.4    Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
                      Guarantee Fund 
              The  payment  of  the  balance  reimburses  the  remaining  part  of  the  eligible  costs  incurred  by  the 
              beneficiaries for the implementation of the action.  
             
              If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
              of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
              If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency] 
              will pay the balance within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 
              or 48 apply. 
              Payment is subject to the approval of the final report. Its approval does not imply recognition of the 
              compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content. 
              The amount due as the balance is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] by deducting the total 
              amount  of  pre-financing  and  interim  payments  (if  any)  already  made,  from  the  final  grant  amount 
              determined in accordance with Article 5.3: 
                      {final grant amount (see Article 5.3) 
                      minus 
                      {pre-financing and interim payments (if any) made}}. 
              At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
              and: 
             
                  -   if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the coordinator together with 
                      the amount due as the balance;  
                  -   if  the  balance  is  negative  (payment  of  the  balance  taking  the  form  of  recovery):  it  will  be 
                      deducted from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount: 
                          -   is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator 
                          -   is negative, it will be recovered.  
              The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiaries’ consent —  against any other 
              amount owed by a beneficiary to the [Agency, the] Commission or an[other] executive agency (under the 
              EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum EU contribution indicated, for that  beneficiary,  in  the 
              estimated budget (see Annex 2).

              21.5    Notification of amounts due  
              When making payments, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify to the coordinator the amount 
              due, specifying whether it concerns an interim payment or the payment of the balance.  
              For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.  
              In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
              contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.  
              21.6    Currency for payments  
              The [Commission][Agency] will make all payments in euro.  
              21.7    Payments to the coordinator — Distribution to the beneficiaries   
              Payments will be made to the coordinator.  
              Payments to the coordinator will discharge the [Commission][Agency] from its payment obligation.  
              The coordinator must distribute the payments between the beneficiaries without unjustified delay. 
              Pre-financing may however be distributed only: 
                  (a)  if  the  minimum  number  of  beneficiaries  set  out  in  the  call  for  proposals  has  acceded  to  the 
                      Agreement (see Article 56) and 
                  (b)  to beneficiaries that have acceded to the Agreement (see Article 56). 
              21.8    Bank account for payments  
              All payments will be made to the following bank account: 
                      Name of bank: […]        
                      Full name of the account holder: […]     
                      Full account number (including bank codes): […]   
                      [IBAN code: […]]40 
              21.9    Costs of payment transfers  
              The cost of the payment transfers is borne as follows:  
                  -   the [Commission][Agency] bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank; 
                  -   the beneficiary bears the cost of transfers charged by its bank; 
                  -   the party causing a repetition of a transfer bears all costs of the repeated transfer. 
              21.10   Date of payment  
              Payments by the [Commission][Agency] are considered to have been carried out on the date when they are 
              debited to its account.

             EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                 General MGA 
               21.11    Consequences of non-compliance 
               21.11.1  If  the  [Commission][Agency]  does  not  pay  within  the  payment  deadlines  (see  above),  the 
               beneficiaries are entitled to late-payment interest at the rate applied by the European Central Bank (ECB) 
               for its main refinancing operations in euros (‘reference rate’), plus three and a half points. The reference 
               rate is the rate in force on the first day of the month in which the payment deadline expires, as published in 
               the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union.  
               If the late-payment interest is lower than or equal to EUR 200, it will be paid to the coordinator only upon 
               request submitted within two months of receiving the late payment. 
               Late-payment interest is not due if all beneficiaries are EU Member States (including regional and local 
               government authorities or other public bodies acting on behalf of a Member State for the purpose of this 
               Agreement). 
               Suspension of the payment deadline or payments (see Articles 47 and 48) will not be considered as late 
               payment. 
               Late-payment interest covers the period running from the day following the due date for payment (see 
               above), up to and including the date of payment.  
               Late-payment interest is not considered for the purposes of calculating the final grant amount. 
               21.11.2 If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see 
               Article 43) and the Agreement or the participation of the coordinator may be terminated (see Article 50). 
               Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                
               40  BIC or SWIFT code applies to for countries if the IBAN code does not apply. 
              
              
                       
             1. Payments to be made  
             The Commission/Agency will make the following payments to the coordinator: 
                     a pre-financing payment at the beginning of the action (to provide beneficiaries with 
                      cash to start working on the project and continue until the first interim payment) 
                      Pre-financing will NOT be paid before: 
                              the GA is signed (even if the action starts before) 
                              10 days before the action starting date. 
                          Example: 
                          A GA is signed by the coordinator on 30 December 2014 and by the Commission on 5 January 2015. 
                          The action starting date would normally be 1 February 2015, but the consortium has requested a fixed 
                          starting date of 1 September 2014 in its proposal, as the action is a continuation of a previous FP7 
                          project. 
                          After  due  consideration,  the  fixed  starting  date  is  approved.  The  pre-financing  must  be  paid  by  5 
                          February 2015 (i.e. 30 days from the entry into force of the GA). 
                     interim payment(s) to cover eligible costs incurred in the reporting periods (as many 
                      interim payments as number of reporting periods) 
                     the payment of the balance after the end of the action. 
              
             H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21                                                                         196 
                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                             General MGA 
                                  Any payment (i.e. pre-financing, interim payments and payment of the balance) may be offset against 
                            debts of the beneficiaries towards the Commission/Agency or an(other) executive agency — without the 
                            consent of the beneficiary concerned and up to the beneficiary’s maximum grant amount in Annex 2 (see 
                            also Article 44). 
                            
                         All  payments  are  subject  to  a  payment  deadline  (i.e.  number  of  days  within  which  the 
                             
                         Commission/Agency has to pay the consortium — after having received the payment request). 
                                  . 
                         The deadline depends on the type of payment:  
                                  for pre-financing: 30 days  
                                    for interim payments and payment of the balance: 90 days (see Article 21). 
                               If  there are issues with the payment request or with the costs declared which make it 
                               impossible to comply with the payment deadline, the Commission/Agency will suspend 
                               the deadline (see Article 47). 
                             
                         The  pre-financing  payment  is  automatic,  while  for  interim  and  final  payments  the 
                             
                         Commission/Agency must first: 
                                     analyse the technical reports and financial statements 
                                     check the eligibility of the claimed costs 
                                     calculate the amount to be paid 
                                     approve the payment request and authorise the payment. 
                                This is not an in-depth verification and therefore no guarantee for eligibility or correctness. 
                                The costs may still have to be rejected later on, if the Commission/Agency finds — in a 
                                more in-depth verification — that they are ineligible. 
                  The payments are made to the coordinator; the beneficiaries are NOT paid individually.  
                  The coordinator must distribute the amounts received to the beneficiaries — without delay (see 
                  Article 21.7).  
                         How  and  when  the  payments  are  distributed  is  in  principle  an  internal  matter  for  the 
                         consortium. 
                               The consortium agreement may set out, for instance, specific periods for the distribution of 
                               payments or that the distribution will be carried out in instalments (and these will not be 
                               considered ‘unjustified delays’, if the arrangements set out in the consortium agreement 
                               are complied with). 
                               Similarly, the consortium agreement may provide for a distribution of the funding which is 
                               different from the costs claimed. 
                               Also, if the coordinator does NOT comply with its obligations, this is in principle an issue to 
                               be resolved within the consortium. It is only  if the coordinator is  terminated that the 
                               Commission/Agency (and especially the Guarantee Fund) will intervene; see Article 50).  
                  The Commission/Agency will be informed of the distribution of the payments by the coordinator: 
                              if it specifically requests this 
                              in the event of recovery at the payment of the balance (see Article 44)  
                              if the participation of one or more beneficiary is terminated (see Article 50). 
                  The Commission/Agency will notify the coordinator of the amount due, explaining which costs 
                  have been accepted and which have been rejected (if applicable; see Articles 42, 43 and 44).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            The shares for the Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) will always be kept back and not 
            be paid out to the coordinator (the JRC is a Commission DG and the amounts are therefore cleared 
            internally).  
                Example: 
                Four beneficiaries: A, B, C and JRC, with a maximum grant amount of EUR 1 000 000. 
                Estimated budget by beneficiary (Annex 2): A: EUR 300 000; B: EUR 250 000; C: EUR 300 000; JRC: EUR 
                150 000  
                Pre-financing: EUR 400 000, of which EUR 50 000 (5% of maximum grant amount) is kept for the Guarantee 
                Fund and EUR 350 000 transferred to the consortium. 
                JRC share of grant: 15 % (150000/1 000 000)  
                JRC share of pre-financing (kept by the Commission/Agency): 15 % of 350 000 = EUR 52 500  
                Pre-financing payment to coordinator for beneficiaries A, B, C: EUR 350 000 - EUR 52 500 = EUR 297 500 
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries? 
            Pre-financing payment 
            How much? The pre-financing amount does not depend on any financial statement. It is a float 
            that is fixed in each GA and automatically paid at the beginning of the action.  
                How to calculate the pre-financing payment: 
                Step 1 —   Pre-financing amount  
                           The amount of pre-financing is fixed in the GA.  
                           There is no standard amount (or percentage) for the pre-financing payment. For H2020 
                           grants, it will normally be (depending on the availability of EU budget credits) 100 % of 
                           the average EU funding per reporting period (i.e. maximum grant amount set out in 
                           Article  5.1  /  number  of  periods).  For  actions  with  only  one  reporting  period,  it  will 
                           however be less, since 100 % would mean the totality of the grant amount. 
                Step 2 —   Deduction of the Guarantee Fund contribution  
                           At  the  moment  of  the  pre-financing,  an  amount  that  corresponds  to  5 %  of  the 
                           maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1) is deducted from the pre-financing payment 
                           and transferred to the Guarantee Fund. (The Guarantee Fund is a Fund that covers 
                           defaulting beneficiaries). 
                Step 3 —   Pre-financing payment letter 
                           The  Commission/Agency  will  inform  the  coordinator  about  the  amount  due  (pre-
                           financing payment letter).  
            Pre-financing  funds  remain  EU  property  until  the  payment  of  the  balance  —  when  they  are 
            cleared against the eligible costs accepted by the Commission/Agency.  
             
            Example for calculating the pre-financing payment: 
            Action with 3 reporting periods of 18 months. 
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 1 000 000.  
            Reimbursement rate: 100 %. 
            Guarantee Fund contribution: 5% of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 50 000. 
            Pre-financing amount & deduction of Guarantee Fund contribution: 
            Pre-financing amount: EUR 333 334. 
            Amount to be paid out to the consortium as pre-financing: EUR 333 334 - EUR 50 000 = EUR 283 334.

            Payment at beneficiary termination 
            How  much?  The  amount  due  at  beneficiary  termination  will  be  calculated  by  the 
            Commission/Agency on the basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the 
            report on the distribution of payments (see also Articles 44.1.1, 50.2.2 and 50.3.3). 
             
                       The amount due is used to determine whether the terminated beneficiary received too much from the 
                   consortium (and should pay it back to them) and will then flow into the calculation of the next interim and 
                   final payments in order to cap that beneficiary's accepted EU contribution. 
                       The terminated beneficiary's share of the final grant amount (beneficiary's final grant share) will be 
                   calculated  only  at  the  end  of  the  project  (payment  of  the  balance),  together  with  the  rest  of  the 
                   consortium.  
                        If  the  terminated  beneficiary  is  audited  during  the  ongoing  project,  its  amount  due  will  be  re-
                   calculated. If the terminated beneficiary is audited after the end of the project, the recovery will follow the 
                   standard rules (revised final grant amount calculated on the basis of the final grant share).   
                    
                 
                    
                How to calculate the amount due at beneficiary termination: 
                       . 
                Amount due  
                        
                Step 1 —   Calculation of the accepted EU contribution (application of the reimbursement 
                           rate to the eligible costs) 
                           In  order  to  calculate  the  amount  of  accepted  EU  contribution  for  the  beneficiary 
                           concerned, the Commission/Agency will calculate the accepted costs for the beneficiary 
                           and each of its linked third parties (i.e. eligible/not rejected costs declared in the interim 
                           and termination reports; see Articles 6 and 42), apply the reimbursement rate(s) and 
                           sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary. 
                           Only costs incurred (see Article 6.1(a)) by the beneficiary concerned until termination 
                           takes effect are eligible (except for costs for the termination report). Costs relating to 
                           contracts due for execution (i.e. delivery) only after termination are NOT eligible. 
                           If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 30 days of the date 
                           on which termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic 
                           financial report will NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The 
                           Commission/Agency will NOT send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline. 
                           If the beneficiary requested less than the maximum EU contribution, the accepted EU 
                           contribution will be this lower requested amount. 
                 Amount resulting from Step 1. 
                Step 2 —   Grant reductions (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                           obligations), if any  
                           In  order  to  calculate  the  amount  of  grant  reductions,  the  Commission/Agency  will 
                           calculate the grant reductions for the beneficiary concerned and its linked third parties 
                           (if any; see Article 43) and then sum them up to a total amount for the beneficiary. 
                           This total amount of grant reductions is then deducted from the pro rata temporis part 
                           of the beneficiary’s and linked third parties’ maximum grant amounts (Annex 2) — pro 
                           rata temporis corresponding to their period of participation (i.e. until termination). 
                            
                                   For more guidance on grant reductions, see the Guidance on grant reductions. 
                            
                 Amount resulting from Step 2. 
                The amount due is the lower of the two (amount resulting from Step 1 and amount resulting from 
                Step 2).

                Step 3 —   Calculation of the beneficiary balance  
                           In order to establish if the beneficiary received excess funding, the Commission/Agency 
                           will deduct the total amount of pre-financing and interim payments made (according to 
                           the report on the distribution of payments) from the amount due.  
                           If the amount due is higher than the payments already made, the difference will be paid 
                           by the Commission/Agency to the coordinator  at the next interim/final payment. 
                           If the amount due is lower than the payments made, the beneficiary must repay the 
                           difference  (to  the  consortium;  NOT  to  the  Commission/Agency).  If  the  beneficiary 
                           doesn’t, the Commission/Agency will intervene, by activating the Guarantee Fund to pay 
                           the money to the consortium and then recovering it from the beneficiary in the name of 
                           the Guarantee Fund (see below). 
                           If  the  coordinator  does  not  submit  the  report  on  the  distribution  of  payments,  the 
                           terminated beneficiary will NOT have to repay any amounts to the consortium. If there 
                           are issues, the consortium will have to deal with them internally. 
                Step 4 —   Beneficiary calculation letter 
                           The Commission/Agency will inform the beneficiary about the balance, i.e. the amounts 
                           that are owed to the consortium or to the beneficiary concerned (beneficiary termination 
                           calculation letter). 
                           If the closure involves grant reduction or recovery (refund to the consortium), there will 
                           be  two  letters:  a  pre-information  letter  (opening  a  contradictory  procedure)  and 
                           confirmation letter (see Articles 43 and 44). 
                Recovery (if any) 
                Step 5 —   Beneficiary recovery letter & debit note 
                           If  the  beneficiary  does  not  repay  the  consortium  by  the  date  specified  in  the 
                           confirmation letter, the Commission/Agency will activate the Guarantee Fund (to pay the 
                           consortium)  and  claim  back  the  money  paid  by  the  Guarantee  Fund  from  the 
                           beneficiary, (beneficiary recovery letter; see Articles 44 and 50). 
                Step 6 —   Enforced recovery 
                           If  the  beneficiary  does  not  honour  the  debit  note  within  the  deadline,  the 
                           Commission/Agency will enforce its claim, by one of the following (see Article 44): 
                               by offsetting it 
                                ‘Offsetting’ means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency 
                                from  another  amount  that  the  Commission/Agency  owes  to  debtor.  With  the 
                                offsetting both amounts are considered paid. 
                               if  the  Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked 
                                third party: by holding the linked third party liable 
                               taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see Article 
                                57.2) or 
                               adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299 TFEU. 
             
            Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination: 
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods.  
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
            200 000; C= EUR 100 000). 
            Reimbursement rate: 100 %. 
            Pre-financing: EUR 200 000. 
            Amount due: 
            Beneficiary A goes bankrupt in the middle of the action and is terminated at month 18 (of 36), just before the end of 
            RP1. 
            Costs declared by beneficiary A in termination report: EUR 50 000 (direct costs) + EUR 12 500 (25 % flat rate for 
            indirect costs) = EUR 62 500.

            Costs rejected for beneficiary A following audit: EUR 10 000 + EUR 2 500 (25 % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 
            12 500. 
            Accepted costs beneficiary A: EUR 62 500 – EUR 12 500 = EUR 50 000. 
            Application of reimbursement rate: EUR 50 000 (total accepted EU contribution). 
            Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 50 000. 
            10% grant reduction beneficiary A due to breach of obligations: 10% of {{18/36} x EUR 200 000} = 10% of EUR 
            100 000 = EUR 10 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 2: 100 000 – 10 000 = EUR 90 000. 
            Lower amount of the two: EUR 50 000. 
            Beneficiary A amount due: EUR 50 000. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            Payments received by beneficiary A (according to the report on the distribution of payments): EUR 60 000. 
            Beneficiary  A  balance:  EUR  50  000  (amount  due)  -  EUR  60  000  (payments  received)  = EUR  -10 000  (excess 
            payments of EUR 10 000). 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 10 000 (negative balance of EUR 10 000 must be returned to the 
            consortium; otherwise Commission/Agency will start a recovery procedure). 
             
            Interim payments 
            How much? The amount of the interim payments will be calculated by the Commission/Agency 
            on the basis of the financial statements and the payments already made. 
                How to calculate interim payments: 
                Step 1 —   Calculation of the accepted EU contribution (application of the reimbursement 
                           rates to the eligible costs) 
                            In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution, the Commission/Agency 
                           will,  for  each  beneficiary  and  linked  third  party,  calculate  the  accepted  costs  (i.e. 
                           eligible/not rejected costs declared in the financial statement; see Articles 6 and 42), 
                           apply  the  reimbursement rate(s)  and  then  sum  them  up  to  a  total  amount  for  the 
                           consortium.  
                           If a beneficiary/linked third party requested in the financial statements less than the EU 
                           contribution, the accepted EU contribution will be this lower requested amount. 
                Step 2 —   Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount 
                           If the total for the consortium is more than 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus 
                            pre-financing and previous interim payments, it will be capped. 
                Step 3 —   Interim payment letter 
                           The  Commission/Agency  will  inform  the  coordinator  about  the  amount  due  (interim 
                           payment letter).  
                            
            Examples for calculating interim payments: 
            Case 1:  
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and three reporting periods. 
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 1 000 000 and 100% reimbursement rate. 
            Pre-financing of EUR 333 334. 
            Interim payment RP1: 
            Costs declared by the consortium for RP1: EUR 500 000 (direct costs) + EUR 125 000 (25% flat rate for indirect 
            costs) = EUR 625 000. 
            After  checking  the  reports  EUR 20 000  of  the direct  costs  claimed by beneficiary  A  and  EUR 12 000 of  those 
            claimed by beneficiary B are considered not eligible and  rejected. The Commission/Agency therefore rejects 
            EUR 32 000 direct costs + EUR 8 000 (25% flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 40 000. 
            Total accepted costs RP1: EUR 585 000. 
            Application of reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 585 000 (total accepted EU contribution).

            Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing = EUR 900 000 – EUR 333 334 = EUR 566 666. 
            Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP1: EUR 566 666. 
            Interim payment RP 2: 
            Total accepted costs RP2: EUR 162 500.  
            Amount to be paid out to the consortium as interim payment for RP2: EUR 0 (the 90% limit has already been 
            reached in RP1: 333 334 + 566 666 = 900 000). 
             
            Case 2 (grant with terminated beneficiary):  
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C) and two reporting periods. 
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000  (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2: A= EUR 200 000; B= EUR 
            200 000; C= EUR 100 000).

            Application of the reimbursement rate 100%: EUR 306 250 (total accepted EU contribution). 
            Limit to 90 % of the maximum grant amount minus pre-financing: EUR 450 000 – EUR 200 000 = EUR 250 000.

              Articles 5.3 and 44.1.2). 
              If the final grant amount is higher than the payments already made, the balance will take the form 
              of a payment; if the final grant amount is lower than the payments made, the balance will take 
              the form of a recovery. 
                  How to calculate the payment of the balance: 
                  Final grant amount 
                  Step 1 —   Calculation of the accepted EU contribution (application of the reimbursement 
                                rates to the eligible costs) 
                                In order to calculate the amount of accepted EU contribution, the Commission/Agency 
                                will, for each beneficiary/linked third party, calculate the accepted costs (i.e. eligible/not 
                                rejected costs declared in the financial statements; see Articles 6 and 42), apply the 
                                reimbursement rate(s) and then sum them up to a total amount for the consortium. 
                                If a beneficiary/linked third party requested less than the maximum EU contribution, the 
                                accepted EU contribution will be this lower requested amount. 
                  Step 2 —   Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                 If the total for the consortium is more than the maximum grant amount for the action 
                                 (see Article 5.1), it will be capped at that amount 
                  Step 3 —   Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit (no-profit rule) 
                                From this amount, the Commission/Agency will deduct any profit made due to receipts.  
                                Thus, the total accepted EU contribution + receipts are capped at the total accepted 
                                costs;  the  amount  resulting  from  Steps  1  and  2  plus  receipts  cannot  exceed  the 
                                accepted costs.  
                                      If grant amount + receipts > total accepted costs  deduction of profit  
                                  
                                           Profit  is  assessed  at  the  level  of  the  action,  NOT  at  the  level  of  the  individual 
                                      beneficiaries (    new in Horizon 2020).  
                                      The amounts taken into account are the total accepted EU contribution (following Steps 1 
                                      and 2), the total receipts and the total accepted costs.  
                                       
                                 The receipts that must be taken into account are receipts which have been, during the 
                                           .

                                         established (i.e. revenue that has been collected AND entered in the accounts) 
                                         generated (i.e. revenue that has not yet been collected, but which has been 
                                       
                                          generated) or 
                                       
                                         confirmed  (i.e.  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been  collected,  but  for  which  the 
                                          beneficiary has a commitment or written confirmation).

                               The following are considered receipts: 
                                      income generated by the action (i.e. any income generated by the action 
                                        itself, including the sale of assets bought for the action and sold during the 
                                        action duration)  
                                             Examples: admission fee to a conference organised by the consortium; sale of 
                                             equipment bought for the action. 
                                         Receipts from the sale of assets are capped at the amount of costs declared 
                                         for the asset. 
                                             Example:  
                                             Machine bought for EUR 21 000 in year X, sold in year X + 4 (both within the 
                                             action duration) for EUR 16 000.  
                                             The machine was used at 50% for the action, and fully depreciated in 3 years 
                                             (7 000 EUR/year, of which 3 500 EUR/year were charged to the action) 
                                             Amount of receipts to be declared: 50% of 16 000 with a limit of 10 500 (3 x 3 
                                             500) = EUR 8 000 
                                      financial contributions given by third parties specifically to be used for the 
                                        action  (i.e.  money  given as  a  donation  by  a  third  party  (a  donor)  to  a 
                                        beneficiary/linked third party specifically for being used for the action) 
                                      in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge specifically to 
                                        be used for the action, if they have been declared as eligible costs (i.e. not 
                                        money, but an in-kind contribution free of charge given by a third party (a 
                                        donor) specifically for being used for the action)  
                                             Examples: the free use of equipment; the secondment of an expert without 
                                             reimbursement 
                                        Receipts  due  to  free  of  charge  in-kind  contributions  are  capped  by  the 
                                        amount declared as third party costs for the contribution. 
                               The following are NOT considered receipts: 
                                       in-kind contributions given by a third party (donor) free of charge — if 
                                        they were not given specifically to be used for the action 
                                             Example: A university professor whose costs are charged by the beneficiary 
                                             university  in  the  GA,  but  whose  salary  is  paid  by  the  ministry  and  not 
                                             reimbursed by the university: This in-kind contribution from a third party (the 
                                             ministry)  is  not  to  be  considered  a  receipt,  unless  the  professor  has  been 
                                             specifically seconded by the ministry to the university to work for the action in 
                                             question. In other words, if the university is free to decide the allocation of the 
                                             professor's work, then his/her contribution is assimilated to an ‘own resource’ of 
                                             the university and it is not a receipt. 
                                       financial contributions given by a third party (donor) specifically to be used 
                                        for the action — if they may be used according to the donor’s rules to cover 
                                        also costs other than the eligible costs 
                                             Example: currency exchange losses  
                                       financial contributions given by a third party (donor) specifically to be used 
                                        for the action — if the donor did not set the obligation to repay any unused 
                                        amount at the end of the action  
                                        In this case, the full amount of the financial contribution is considered not a 
                                        receipt (not only the unused amount).  
                                       financial  contributions  made  by  one  beneficiary to  another  within the 
                                        same action — since receipts are only contributions from third parties 
                                        Conversely, such a financial contribution cannot either be declared as cost 
                                        for the action. 
                                             Example: Beneficiary A (big company) in an innovation project (i.e. funded at 
                                             70%) decides to subsidise a small specialised SME by funding an additional 
                                             10% of the SME’s costs in order to encourage it to participate in the action.

                                       income generated by exploiting the results of the project (e.g. the IPR) — 
                                        since successfully exploiting the results is one of the main objectives of the 
                                        action  
                                    
                                       Receipts will be taken into account by the Commission/Agency only at the moment of 
                                    the payment of the balance (i.e. the final payment at the end of the action). They must 
                                    
                                    be declared in the final report. 
                                    
                                    In many cases they will not affect the grant amount since they do not lead to a profit 
                                    (at the level of the action). However, particularly in actions funded at 100%, they may 
                                    
                                    have an impact and cause a reduction. 
                                        Examples: 
                                        1. Eligible costs: 100 and grant amount: 70 
                                               If receipts: 30  no impact 
                                               If receipts: 20  no impact 
                                               If receipts: 60  the grant amount will be reduced to 40. 
                                        2. Eligible costs: 100 and grant amount: 100 
                                               If receipts: 0  no impact; 
                                               If receipts: 20  the grant amount will be reduced to 80 
                                        Best  practice:  The  potential  implications  of  receipts  should  be  addressed  in  the 
                                        consortium agreement (see Article 41.3).  
                                     
                                     
                 Amount resulting from Steps 1-3. 
                Step 4 —   Grant reductions (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                                     
                           obligations), if any 
                                     
                           In order to calculate the amount of grant reductions (if any), the Commission/Agency 
                           will, for each beneficiary/linked third party, calculate the grant reductions at their level, 
                                     
                           add any reductions that must be made at action-level and then sum them up to a total 
                           amount for the consortium (see Article 43).  
                           This total amount of grant reductions for the consortium is then deducted from the 
                           maximum grant amount for the action set out in Article 5.1. 
                            
                                  For more guidance on grant reductions, see the Guidance on grant reductions. 
                            
                 Amount resulting from Step 4. 
                The final grant amount is the lower of the 2 (amount resulting from Steps 1-3 and amount 
                resulting from Step 4). 
                Balance 
                Step 5 —   Calculation of the balance & Guarantee Fund release 
                           In order to calculate the balance, the Commission/Agency will deduct the total amount 
                           of pre-financing and interim payments made from the final grant amount.  
                           If the final grant amount is higher than the payments already made, the balance will 
                           take the form of a payment. In addition, the Guarantee Fund contribution (5% that were 
                           kept from the pre-financing) will be released with a separate payment. 
                           If the final grant amount is lower than the payments made, the balance will take the 
                           form of a recovery (amount overpaid needs to be paid back to the Commission/Agency; 
                           see Article 44). In this case, the amount to be paid back will be directly compensated 
                           against the Guarantee Fund release and if this amount is sufficient to cover the debt, 
                           the recovery process ends (instead the consortium will be paid the remainder of the 
                           Guarantee  Fund  contribution,  if  any  is  left).  If  the  Guarantee  Fund  amount  is  not 
                           sufficient, further steps will be taken to recover the rest (see below).  
                Step 6 —   Payment of the balance letter & debit note 
                           The  Commission/Agency  will  inform  the  coordinator  about  the  amount  due  to  the 
                           consortium or the amount that needs to be paid back (payment of the balance letter).

                 EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                General MGA 
                                        If the final payment involves a grant reduction or recovery, there will be two letters: a 
                                        pre-information letter (opening a contradictory procedure) and a confirmation letter (see 
                                        Articles 43 and 44). 
                                        If there is still an amount to be recovered after compensation with the Guarantee Fund 
                                        release,  the  confirmation  letter  will  include  a  debit  note  to  the  coordinator  for  the 
                                        amount and the division of final grant amount table (see below). 
                      Recovery (if any) 
                      Step 7a —  Recovery from the coordinator 
                                        If the coordinator pays the debt by the date specified in the debit note, the recovery 
                                        process ends. 
                                        If the coordinator does NOT repay the Commission/Agency by the date specified AND if 
                                        it   has  NOT  submitted  the  report  on  the  distribution  of  payments,  the 
                                        Commission/Agency  will  pursue  recovery  against  the  coordinator  alone  (enforced 
                                        recovery, see below). 
                      Step 7b —  Recovery from the beneficiaries  
                                        If the coordinator does NOT repay the Commission/Agency by the date specified, BUT 
                                        has submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the Commission/Agency will: 
                                                   identify the beneficiaries that received funds in excess and 
                                                   calculate the amount each beneficiary owes to the Commission/Agency. 
                            Step 7ba — Identifying the beneficiaries with excess funding  
                                        In     order  to  identify  the  beneficiaries  that  received  excess  funding,  the 
                                        Commission/Agency will compare the amount each beneficiary actually received (report 
                                        on the distribution of payments) with its share of the final grant amount (beneficiary’s 
                                        accepted  EU  contribution  divided  by  total  accepted  EU  contribution  and  obtained 
                                        percentage then applied to final grant amount). 
                                              Beneficiary’s final grant share formula: 
                                                    {{{beneficiary’s accepted costs  
                                                    multiplied by 
                                                    reimbursement rate} 
                                                    divided by 
                                                    accepted EU contribution calculated under Step 1} 
                                                    multiplied by 
                                                    final grant amount for the action} 
                                        This means that the final grant amount is redistributed between the beneficiaries in 
                                        proportion to their accepted costs (especially important for overspent grants, i.e. where 
                                        the  consortium  declared  costs  above  the  maximum  grant  amount  limit  and  each 
                                        beneficiary’s accepted EU contribution must therefore be adjusted to bring it into line 
                                        with the maximum grant amount) and then compared to the amounts they received 
                                        from the coordinator. 
                                        Recovery will  be  pursued  only  against  the  beneficiaries  with  a  negative  result  (i.e. 
                                        excess of payments received over final grant amount share).  
                            Step 7bb — Division of the debt  
                                        In  order  to  calculate  the  amount  each  of  those  beneficiaries  has  to  pay  back,  the 
                                        Commission/Agency will split the amount to be recovered between them (in proportion 
                                        to their relative share of the total payments in excess; division of final grant amount 
                                        table). 
                            Step 7bc — Beneficiary recovery letter & debit note  
                                        The Commission/Agency will cancel the debit note sent to the coordinator and inform 
                                        the beneficiaries concerned about the amounts to be paid back, together with a debit 
                                        note for each beneficiary (beneficiary recovery letter).

                Step 8 —   Enforced recovery 
                           If the coordinator/beneficiaries do not honour the debit note within the deadline, the 
                           Commission/Agency will enforce its claim(s) by one of the following (see Article 44): 
                               by offsetting it 
                                ‘Offsetting’ means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency 
                                from  another  amount  that  the  Commission/Agency  owes  to  debtor.  With  the 
                                offsetting both amounts are considered paid. 
                               by drawing on the Guarantee Fund and then follow it up with a debit note on 
                                behalf of the Guarantee Fund, to continue the recovery procedure by: 
                                   if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked 
                                    third party: by holding the linked third party liable 
                                or 
                                   by either: 
                                       taking legal action in a national court or the European Court of Justice (see 
                                        Article 57.2) or 
                                       adopting a decision that is enforceable within the meaning of Article 299

            Reimbursement rate: 100%. 
            Payments made (pre-financing and interim): EUR 900 000 (limit of 90% of the maximum grant amount). 
            Guarantee Fund contribution: 5% of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 50 000. 
            Payments received: EUR 900 000 – EUR 50 000 = EUR 850 000. 
            Final grant amount:  
            Total accepted costs: EUR 1 045 000. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100 % = EUR 1 045 000 (total accepted EU contribution).

            Release of Guarantee Fund: EUR 50 000 (to be paid to consortium). 
            Amounts to be paid out to the consortium: EUR 100 000 (positive balance) + EUR 50 000 (Guarantee Fund

            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C).  
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 3 000 000 (beneficiary maximum grant amounts in Annex 2:  A= EUR 1 000 000; B= 
            EUR 1 500 000; C= EUR 500 000) 
            Reimbursement rate: 100%. 
            Payments made (pre-financing and interim): EUR 2 700 000 (limit of 90 % of the maximum grant amount). 
            Guarantee Fund contribution: 5% of 3 000 000 = EUR 150 000. 
            Payments received: EUR 2 700 000 - EUR 150 000 = EUR 2 550 000. 
            Receipts: 
                Beneficiary A was sponsored for this project by a private company with an amount of EUR 60 000 dedicated to 
                the reimbursement of the remuneration of one young researcher. 
                Beneficiary B (a university) received as in-kind contribution from its government the secondment of a scientist 
                specifically assigned to the project. The salary of this seconded scientist (EUR 80 000) was declared as cost by 
                this beneficiary, even if paid by the government.     
            Final grant amount:  
            Total accepted costs: EUR 2 500 000 direct costs (including EUR 200 000 for subcontracting) + EUR 575 000 for 
            indirect costs (25 % flat rate on direct costs minus subcontracting) = EUR 3 075 000. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 3 075 000 (total accepted EU contribution). 
            Limit to maximum grant amount: EUR 3 000 000. 
            Calculation of receipts and deduction of profit: Profit: EUR 3 140 000 (total accepted EU contribution + receipts : 
            EUR 3 000 000 + EUR 60 000 + EUR 80 000) – EUR 3 075 000 (total accepted costs) = EUR 65 000 
            Amount after deducting profit: EUR 3 000 000 – EUR 65 000 = EUR 2 935 000. 
            Amount resulting from Steps 1 to 3: EUR 2 935 000. 
            10% grant reduction beneficiary A: 10% of EUR 1 000 000 = EUR 100 000. 
            No other grant reductions. 
            Amount resulting from Step 4: 3 000 000 - 100 000 = EUR 2 900 000. 
            Lower amount of the two: EUR 2 900 000. 
            Final grant amount: EUR 2 900 000. 
            Balance & Guarantee Fund release: 
            Payments made: EUR 2 700 000. 
            Balance: EUR 2 900 000 (final grant amount) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR +200 000 (positive balance 
            to be paid to the consortium). 
            Release of Guarantee Fund: EUR 150 000 (to be paid to consortium).

            Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount 
            The  amount  to  be  recovered  (or  paid)  after  the  final  payment  will  be  calculated  by  the 
            Commission/Agency on the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount 
            (see also Articles 5.4 and 44.1.3).  
            If the revised final grant amount is lower than the beneficiary’s share of the final grant amount 
            (beneficiary final grant share), the difference will be recovered. 
                How to calculate recoveries after payment of the balance: 
                Revised final grant amount 
                Step 1 —   Re-calculation of the accepted EU contribution  
                           In order to calculate the revised amount of accepted EU contribution for the beneficiary 
                           concerned, the Commission/Agency will calculate the revised amount of accepted costs 
                           for the beneficiary (i.e. eligible/not rejected costs declared in the financial statements; 
                           see Articles 6 and 42) and apply the reimbursement rate. 
                           If  the  audit  concerns  a  linked  third  party,  the  revised  final  grant  amount  will  be 
                           calculated for its beneficiary. 
                 Amount resulting from Step 1. 
                Step 2 —   Grant reductions (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                           obligations), if any  
                           In  order  to  calculate  the  amount  of  grant  reductions,  the  Commission/Agency  will 
                           calculate the grant reduction for the beneficiary concerned (if any; see Article 43). 
                           This amount of grant reduction is then deducted from the beneficiary’s maximum grant 
                           amount set out in Annex 2. 
                           If the audit concerns a linked third party, the grant reduction will be calculated for the 
                           linked third party (i.e. deducted from its maximum grant amount), but the revised final 
                           grant amount will be calculated at beneficiary-level. 
                           For beneficiaries that overspent (i.e. declared more costs at payment of the balance 
                           than their maximum grant amount), the reduction rate (percentage) will be applied 
                           directly  to  their  share  of  the  final  grant  amount  and  the  resulting  amount  will  be 
                           recovered (—short cut to ensure a proportionate result for beneficiaries that contributed 
                           more  to  the  action  than  initially  planned  in  the  estimated  budget;  avoids 
                           disproportionate grant reductions compared to the real project participation; see also 
                           Article 4.2). 
                            
                                 For more guidance on grant reductions, see the Guidance on grant reductions. 
                            
                 Amount resulting from Step 2. 
                The revised final grant amount is the lower of the two (amount resulting from Step 1 and amount 
                resulting from Step 2). 
                Balance & recovery (if any) 
                Step 3 —   Calculation of the beneficiary balance 
                           In  order  to  calculate  if  the  beneficiary  has  to  pay  back  any  amounts,  the 
                           Commission/Agency will compare the beneficiary’s revised final grant amount with its 
                           final grant share (see above). 
                                Beneficiary’s final grant share formula: 
                                    {{{beneficiary’s accepted costs  
                                    multiplied by 
                                    reimbursement rate} 
                                    divided by 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21                                                            210

                                                        accepted EU contribution calculated under Step 1} 
                                                        multiplied by 
                                                        final grant amount for the action} 
                                           If the revised final grant amount is lower than its final grant share, the difference will be 
                                           recovered. 
                                           If exceptionally the audit (or check, review or investigation) showed that the beneficiary 
                                           made errors resulting  in  less  cost  declared  than  its  eligible  costs,  there  will  be  no 
                                           recovery.  Instead,  the  beneficiary  will  be  allowed  to  submit  corrected  financial 
                                           statements to claim the difference. 
                        Step 4 —   Audit implementation letters & debit note 
                                           The Commission/Agency will inform the beneficiary about the amounts put in question 
                                           (audit implementation letter). 
                                           If the audit implementation involves a grant reduction or recovery (generally the case), 
                                           there will be two letters: a pre-information letter (opening a contradictory procedure) 
                                           and a confirmation letter (see Articles 43 and 44). 
                                           If there is an amount to be recovered, the confirmation letter will include a debit note 
                                           for the amount. 
                                            
                                                    In  case  of  European  Court  of  Auditor  audits,  OLAF  investigations  and  Member  State 
                                               judgments with a financial impact on the grant, similar procedures and letters will be used. 
                                                
                          
                                                     . 
                         Step 5 —   Enforced recovery 
                                                      
                                           If  the  beneficiary  does  not  honour  the  debit  note  within  the  deadline,  the 
                                           Commission/Agency will enforce its claim by one of the following (see Article 44): 
                                                
                                               by offsetting it 
                                                  ‘Offsetting’ means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency 
                                                  from  another  amount  that  the  Commission/Agency  owes  to  debtor.  With  the 
                                                  offsetting both amounts are considered paid. 
                                               by drawing on the Guarantee Fund and then follow it up with a debit note on 
                                                  behalf of the Guarantee Fund, to continue the recovery procedure by: 
                                                       if the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability from a linked 
                                                        third party: by holding the linked third party liable 
                                                  or

                  Reimbursement rate: 100 %. 
                  Final grant amount: 
                  Total accepted costs: EUR 187 500 + EUR 156 250 + EUR 150 000 = EUR 493 750 
                         A: EUR 150 000 (direct costs) + EUR 37 500 (25 % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 187 500 
                         B: EUR 125 000 (direct costs) + EUR 31 250 (25 % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 156 250

            No receipts/profit. 
            No grant reductions

            EUR 150 000). 
            Beneficiary revised final grant amount: 
            An audit concluded that the direct costs of beneficiary A were not eligible for an amount of EUR 30 000 and that 
            there were issues with the visibility of EU funding and IPR. 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary A: EUR 150 000  (direct costs) — EUR 30 000 (rejected 
            direct costs) = EUR 120 000 + EUR 30 000 (25 % flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 150 000. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 150 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 150 000. 
            10% grant reduction for beneficiary A: 10% of 200 000 = EUR 20 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 2: 200 000 – 20 000 = EUR 180 000. 
            Lower amount of the two: EUR 150 000. 
            Beneficiary A revised final grant amount: EUR 150 000. 
            The other beneficiaries final grant amounts (i.e. their final grant shares) remain unchanged. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            Balance: EUR 150 000 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 187 500 (final grant share) = EUR –37 500 (excess of EUR 
            37 500). 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 37 500 (negative balance of EUR 37 500 must be paid back by the 
            beneficiary). 
             
            Case 2 (recovery – overspent grant):

            Final grant amount: 
            Total accepted costs: EUR 200 000 + EUR 150 000 + EUR 250 000 = EUR 600 000 
                A: EUR 160 000 (direct costs) + EUR 40 000 (indirect costs) = EUR 200 000 
                B: EUR 120 000 (direct costs) + EUR 30 000 (indirect costs) = EUR 150 000 
                C: EUR 200 000 (direct costs) + EUR 50 000 (indirect costs) = EUR 250 000. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 600 000 (total accepted EU contribution). 
            Limit to the maximum grant amount: EUR 500 000. 
            Final grant amount = EUR 500 000. 
            Beneficiary revised final grant amounts: 
            An audit concluded that direct costs of beneficiary A were not eligible for an amount of EUR 30 000. 
            Another audit concluded that direct costs of beneficiary C were not eligible for an amount of EUR 20 000 and that 
            there were issues with the confidentiality obligations. 
            Calculation of the beneficiaries final grant shares: 
                A: (200 000/600 000) x 500 000 = EUR 166 667 
                B: (150 000/600 000) x 500 000 = EUR 125 000 
                C: (250 000/600 000) x 500 000 = EUR 208 333. 
            Beneficiary A: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary A: EUR 160 000 (direct costs) – EUR 30 000 (rejected 
            costs) = EUR 130 000 + EUR 32 500 (25% flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 162 500. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 162 500. 
            No grant reductions 
            Beneficiary A revised final grant amount: EUR 162 500. 
            Beneficiary C: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary C: EUR 200 000 (direct costs) – 20 000 (rejected costs) = 
            EUR 180 000 + EUR 45 000 ((25% flat rate for indirect costs) = EUR 225 000. 
            Application of the reimbursement rate: 100% = EUR 225 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 225 000.

            10% grant reduction beneficiary C: 10% of 200 000 = EUR 20 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 2: 200 000 – 20 000 = EUR 180 000. 
            Lower amount of the two: EUR 180 000. 
            Beneficiary C revised final grant amount: EUR 180 000. 
            Beneficiary B’s final grant amounts (i.e. its final grant amount share) remains unchanged. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            Beneficiary A: 
            Balance: EUR 162 500 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 166 667 (final grant share) = EUR –4 167 (excess of EUR 
            4 167). 
            Beneficiary C: 
            Balance: EUR 180 000 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 208 333 (final grant share) = EUR -28 333 (excess of EUR 
            4 167). 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 4 167 (negative balance of EUR 4 167 must be paid back by the 
            beneficiary). 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary C:  
                In principle: EUR 28 333 (negative balance according to normal calculation). 
                However, since normal calculation leads to disproportionate grant reductions for beneficiaries that overspent at 
                payment of the balance: shortcut calculation (see above): 10% of EUR 208 333 = EUR 20 833.

                           22.1               Checks, reviews and audits by the [Agency and the] Commission  
                           22.1.1  Right to carry out checks 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission will — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — check 
                           the  proper  implementation  of  the  action  and  compliance  with  the  obligations  under  the  Agreement, 
                           including assessing deliverables and reports. 
                           For this purpose the [Agency or the] Commission may be assisted by external persons or bodies. 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may also request additional information in accordance with Article 17. 
                             The [Agency or the] Commission may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it directly. 
                          
                             Information  provided  must  be  accurate,  precise  and  complete  and  in  the  format  requested,  including 
                           electronic format. 
                            
                              
                                            
                         1. Checks 
                         The Commission/Agency may — at any moment and without any time-limit — check any aspect 
                         relating to the grant.  
                                              Examples: 
                                              1.  After  receiving  the  reports  (see  Article  20),  the  Commission  checks  the  different  documents 
                                              (explanation of the work carried out, overview of the progress, explanation of the use of resources, etc.), 
                                              for consistency with the description and work plan of the action. 
                                              2. The Agency performs a plagiarism check on documents submitted by the consortium. 
                                              3. After receiving information about misconducts concerning a certain beneficiary that participates in EU 
                                              actions, the Commission checks all the grant agreements in order to see if it needs to take action. 
                                              4. After the end of the action, the Commission receives a complaint by one of the beneficiaries that 
                                              another beneficiary does not respect its intellectual property obligations and decides to look into this 
                                              allegation. 
                         The  checks  itself  are  internal.  They  may  however  have  external  effects,  since  the 
                         Commission/Agency may lead to a request for information (see Article 17.1) or it may take 
                         Chapter 6 measures in view of the results.  
                                              Example: The beneficiaries did not clearly explain the allocation and use of resources in their periodic 
                                              report. The Commission asks for more information by a certain date. 
                         The checks may also extend to third parties involved in the action (which is why beneficiaries must 
                         ensure that the Commission/Agency can exercise its rights towards contractors, subcontractors, 
                         linked  third  parties  or  third  parties  providing  in-kind  contributions,  by  including  appropriate 
                         clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10-14). 
                         The  Commission/Agency  may  carry  out  checks  using  its  own  staff  or  with  the  assistance  of 
                         external expert(s) or bodies — without asking the beneficiaries for approval before appointing 
                         them. In this case, the Commission/Agency will ensure that there is no conflict of interest by 
                         asking the expert(s) to sign a declaration.

            If  the  check  shows  ineligible  costs  or  serious  breach  of  obligations,  it  may  lead  to  cost 
            rejection or grant reduction and, if necessary, recovery (see Articles 42, 43 and 44). If a more in-
            depth examination is required, the Commission/Agency may start a review or audit.

                           22.1.2 Right to carry out reviews 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry 
                           out reviews on the proper implementation of the action  (including assessment of deliverables and reports), 
                             compliance with the obligations under the Agreement and continued scientific or technological relevance of 
                           the action. 
                           Reviews may be started up to two years after the payment of the balance. They will be formally notified to 
                           the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
                             notification. 
                          
                           If the review is carried out on a third party (see Articles 10 to 16), the beneficiary concerned must inform 
                             the third party. 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out reviews directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
                           external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will inform the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of 
                           the identity of the external persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds 
                             of commercial confidentiality. 
                           The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must provide — within the deadline requested — any information 
                           and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including information on the use of 
                           resources). The [Agency or the] Commission may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it 
                             directly. 
                           The coordinator or beneficiary concerned may be requested to participate in meetings, including with 
                           external experts. 
                           For  on-the-spot  reviews,  the  beneficiaries  must  allow  access  to  their  sites  and  premises,  including  to 
                           external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available. 
                           Information  provided  must  be  accurate,  precise  and  complete  and  in  the  format  requested,  including 
                           electronic format. 
                           On the basis of the review findings, a ‘review report’ will be drawn up. 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the review report to the coordinator or beneficiary 
                             concerned, which has 30 days to formally notify observations (‘contradictory review procedure’). 
                          
                           Reviews (including review reports) are in the language of the Agreement. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Project reviews 
                         The Commission/Agency may — at any moment and up until 2 years after the payment of the 
                         balance — carry out a review.  
                                  Reviews normally concern mainly the technical implementation of the action (i.e. its scientific 
                                  and technological implementation), but may also cover financial and budgetary aspects or 
                                  compliance with other obligations under the GA and may exceptionally also concern issues 
                                  related to only one specific beneficiary.  
                         H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 22.1.2                                                                                                                                                                                   216 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                They consist in an in-depth examination (often done with the help of independent experts) of 
                the progress of the action, and in particular: 
                          the  degree  to  which  the  work  plan  has  been  carried  out  and  whether  all 
                            deliverables were completed 
                          whether  the  objectives  are  still  relevant  and  provide  scientific  or  industrial 
                            breakthrough potential 
                          how resources were planned and used in relation to the achieved progress, and if 
                            their use respected the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness 
                          the management procedures and methods of the action 
                          the beneficiaries’ contributions and integration within the action 
                          the expected potential scientific, technological, economic, competitive and social 
                            impact, and plans for using and disseminating results. 
                For some types of actions, they may be done regularly (e.g. for the periodic reports related to 
                a payment, to help the Commission/Agency to properly assess the action implementation and 
                the work carried out by the beneficiaries). 
                They may also extend to third parties involved in the action (which is why beneficiaries must 
                ensure  that  the  Commission/Agency  can  exercise  its  rights  towards  contractors, 
                subcontractors, linked third parties or third parties providing in-kind contributions, by including 
                appropriate clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10-14). 
            If the review shows ineligible costs or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
            breach of obligations (including non- or improper implementation of the action as described in 
            Annex 1), it may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction and recovery 
            (see Articles 42-44, 47-50) and to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see Article 45).  
            If  carried  out  during  the  implementation  of  the  action,  a  review  may  also  recommend 
            reorientations to the action. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The review will be initiated by a letter sent to the coordinator (or, exceptionally, the beneficiary 
            concerned) via the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                The letter will also mention the names of the independent experts that have been appointed (if 
                any).  The  consortium  may  object  to  an  expert,  but  only  on  the  grounds  of  commercial 
                confidentiality. 
            The  review  may  include  on-the-spot  visits  or  a  review  meeting  (on  Commission/Agency 
            premises or anywhere relevant for the action). 
                If  there  is  a  meeting,  the  invitation  will  indicate  the  documents  that  will  be  discussed, 
                normally: 
                      Annex 1 (the contractual description of the action against which the assessment will 
                        be made)  
                      for periodic reviews: the periodic report(s) (technical and financial) for the period(s) 
                        under review (including documents related to financial/budgetary issues) 
                      deliverables that were due 
                      for final reviews: the final report and all periodic reports.

                           22.1.3                 Right to carry out audits 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry 
                           out  audits  on  the  proper  implementation  of  the  action  and  compliance  with  the  obligations  under  the 
                           Agreement. 
                           Audits may be started up to two years after the payment of the balance. They will be formally notified to 
                            the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
                           notification. 
                           If the audit is carried out on a third party (see Articles 10 to 16), the beneficiary concerned must inform the 
                           third party. 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out audits directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
                           external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will inform the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of 
                            the identity of the external persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds 
                           of commercial confidentiality. 
                           The  coordinator  or  beneficiary  concerned  must  provide  —  within  the  deadline  requested  —  any 
                           information (including complete accounts, individual salary statements or other personal data) to verify 
                            compliance with the Agreement. The [Agency or the] Commission may request beneficiaries to provide 
                           such information to it directly 
                           For  on-the-spot  audits,  the  beneficiaries  must  allow  access  to  their  sites  and  premises,  including  to 
                           external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available. 
                           Information  provided  must  be  accurate,  precise  and  complete  and  in  the  format  requested,  including 
                           electronic format. 
                           On the basis of the audit findings, a ‘draft audit report’ will be drawn up. 
                           The  [Agency  or  the]  Commission  will  formally  notify  the  draft  audit  report  to  the  coordinator  or 
                           beneficiary  concerned,  which  has  30  days  to  formally  notify  observations  (‘contradictory  audit 
                            procedure’). This period may be extended by the [Agency or the] Commission in justified cases. 
                          
                           The ‘final audit report’ will take into account observations by the coordinator or beneficiary concerned. 
                            The report will be formally notified to it. 
                           Audits (including audit reports) are in the language of the Agreement. 
                          
                            The [Agency or the] Commission may also access the beneficiaries’ statutory records for the periodical 
                           assessment of unit costs or flat-rate amounts [or lump sums]. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Audits 
                         The Commission/Agency may — at any moment and up until 2 years after the payment of the 
                         balance — carry out an audit.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                        Record-keeping  — Once an audit  has  started,  the  beneficiary  must  keep  ALL  the  records  and 
                   supporting  documents  until  the  audit  procedure  AND  its  follow-up  (including  cost  rejection,  grant 
                   reduction, recovery and litigation) is completed.  
                       Example: If the beneficiary archives the paper copies of the original supporting documentation not on its 
                       premises, the documentation must be retrieved and sent there in time for the audit fieldwork. 
                    
                Audits normally concern mainly the financial implementation of the action by a beneficiary (i.e. 
                    
                financial and budgetary implementation), but may also cover technical aspects or compliance 
                with other obligations under the GA. 
                       . 
                        
                They consist in an in-depth examination (by professional (external or Commission/Agency) 
                auditors and according to the generally accepted audit standards) of the implementation of the 
                    
                action by the beneficiary. 
                    
                They  may  also  extend  to  third  parties  involved  in  the  action  and  third  parties  receiving 
                financial  support  or  a  prize  (which  is  why  beneficiaries  must  ensure  that  the 
                    
                Commission/Agency auditors can exercise their  rights  towards  contractors,  subcontractors, 
                    
                linked third parties or third parties providing in-kind contributions, by including appropriate 
                clauses in their contracts with them; see Articles 10-15). 
                    
                     Examples: 
                     1. The Commission/Agency will audit linked third parties, as if they were beneficiaries. The audit will be 
                     carried out on the premises of the third party and all communication concerning the audit will be carried 
                     out  directly  with  the  linked  third  party  (e.g.  audit  initiation  letter,  contradictory  audit  procedure). 
                     However, since the financial consequences would normally have to be borne by the linked third party’s 
                     beneficiary (see Article 44), the Commission/Agency will also notify the beneficiary about the launching 
                     the audit, as well as about a summary of its conclusions.  
                     2. The Commission/Agency may audit third parties providing in-kind contributions (free of charge or 
                     against payment), in the context of an audit of a beneficiary, in order to see if the costs claimed for the in-
                     kind contribution are eligible. The audit procedure will formally be with the beneficiary and the beneficiary 
                     will be responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary documents and to the third 
                     party’s premises, if necessary. 
                     3. The Commission/Agency may audit contractors or subcontractors, in the context of an audit of a 
                     beneficiary, in order to: 
                           see if contracts/subcontracts were awarded in compliance with the requirements of the H2020 GA 
                            (ensuring best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest price, absence of conflict of interest) 
                           see if payments made under the contract/subcontract match the costs declared by the beneficiary  
                           assess the technical work carried out by the subcontractor. 
                     The  audit  procedure  will  formally  be  with  the  beneficiary  and  the  beneficiary  will  be  responsible  for 
                     ensuring  that  the  auditors  have  access  to  all  necessary  documents  and  to  carry  out  checks  on  the 
                     contractor/subcontractor’s  premises,  if  necessary.  The  audit  will  not  aim  to  check  the 
                     contractors’/subcontractors’ costs or accounts, because the remuneration they get is a set price, not a 
                     reimbursement of costs (except in cases of fraud).  
                     4. The Commission/Agency may audit recipients of financial support or prizes, in the context of an 
                     audit of a beneficiary, in order to see whether the eligibility conditions for the costs declared by the 
                     beneficiary are met. The audit procedure will formally be with the beneficiary and the beneficiary will be 
                     responsible for ensuring that the auditors have access to all necessary documents and to the recipient’s 
                     premises, if necessary. The audit will normally not aim to assess the costs incurred by the recipients 
                     (since they are not relevant for the eligibility of the beneficiary’s costs) — unless Annex 1 of the GA 
                     provides that the financial support must be given as reimbursement of the actual costs of the third parties. 
            If the audit shows, ineligible costs, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud   or serious 
            breach of obligations, it may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant reduction 
            and recovery (see Articles 42-44, 47-50) and, in very serious cases, to exclusion and/or financial 
            penalties (see Article 45). In some cases, findings may result in the acceptance of additional 
            costs (if the beneficiary declared them). 
            Specific cases (audits): 
            Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Commission/Agency may also 
            audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items 
            for which it has fixed unit costs, flat-rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to 
            assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits will normally have no direct 
            consequences for the beneficiaries that were audited; even if the actual costs turn out to be lower, this 
            will not lead to a rejection of costs.

            2. Procedure 
            The audit will be initiated by a letter sent to the beneficiary concerned (via the Funding & Tenders 
            Portal or by registered post with proof of delivery; see Article 52).  
                If the Commission/Agency uses an external audit firm, this letter will mention its name. The 
                beneficiary may object on grounds of commercial confidentiality (together with the reasons 
                why) and — if justified — the Commission/Agency may decide to appoint another external 
                auditor (or, in exceptional circumstances, to carry out the audit itself).  
            The audit usually involves a desk review of the documents requested from the beneficiary and an 
            on-the-spot visit (i.e. on the beneficiary’s premises or on the site on which the action is being 
            implemented). There may however also be audits that consist only in a desk review. 
                The auditors will request access to a wide range of records and documentation (e.g. payslips, 
                labour contracts, complete statutory accounts, etc.) and will indicate how and when it must be 
                provided (and in which format). 
                The  beneficiary  must  provide  the  auditors  with  all  requested  information,  records  and 
                supporting documents (in the format and within the deadline specified). 
                        Example:  A  hard  copy  list  of  records  from  the  general  ledger  (accounting  document)  disclosing 
                        hundreds or thousands of transactions is impossible to process manually, therefore the auditors will 
                        normally require an electronic version. 
                    Objections based on data protection or confidentiality will NOT be accepted.  
                        Where the records and documentation contain personal data, the Commission/Agency 
                        will  process  it  in  compliance  with  Regulation  2018/1725  and  the  beneficiary  must 
                        inform the persons concerned about this processing (see Article 39).  
                        Confidential data will be processed in accordance with Article 36. 
                        Failure to provide the requested information (in the requested format and within the 
                        specified deadline) will lead to the rejection of costs (and possibly other measures, 
                        such as recovery, suspension of payments, termination, administrative and financial 
                        penalties, etc.). 
                For on-the-spot audits, the beneficiary must allow access to its premises and ensure that all 
                records and supporting documentation are readily available. This includes granting access to 
                research facilities and interviewing the researchers that worked on the action.  
            The results of the audit will be recorded in an audit report. 
                The draft audit report will be sent to the beneficiary concerned for comments within 30 days 
                (contradictory  audit  procedure).  (This  is  NOT  the  contradictory  procedure  described  in 
                Article  42.  It  is  a  separate  procedure  that  may,  if  necessary,  be  followed  by  a  second 
                contradictory procedure for cost rejection, grant reduction, etc. under Articles 41 to 46.) 
            The audit procedure will be closed (by the Commission/Agency auditors) with the final audit 
            report and the letter of audit conclusions (LoC) — and the file will then be passed on to the 
            Commission/Agency operational services (authorising officers) for the follow-up, if any.  
             
                         If there are cost adjustments in favour of the EU budget to be made on the basis of the audit, please 
                     do not take any immediate action (do NOT deduct them from the next financial statement). If needed, the 
                     adjustments will be done by the Commission/Agency and you will be informed about them in the payment 
                     letter or audit implementation pre-information letter (with the possibility to take position).

                           procedures), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) may — at any moment during implementation of 
                             the action or afterwards — carry out investigations, including on-the-spot checks and inspections, to 
                           establish whether there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial 
                             interests of the EU.

                                    investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European 
                                    Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18.09.2013, p. 1). 
                             42     Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/1996 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out 
                                 
                                    by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (OJ L 292,

                         1. OLAF investigations 
                         OLAF is the EU’s anti-fraud office, responsible for investigating fraud against the EU budget.  
                         If  the  Commission/Agency  suspects  that  a  beneficiary  or  third  party  involved  in  an  action 
                         committed fraud or other illegal acts, it will inform OLAF, who may decide to investigate. 
                         OLAF will send the outcome of the investigation to the Commission/Agency, who will then decide 
                         how to proceed. 
                         If an OLAF investigation shows ineligible costs, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud  or 
                         serious  breach  of  obligations,  it  may  lead  to  suspension,  termination,  cost  rejection,  grant 
                         reduction and recovery (see Articles 42-44, 47-50), to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see 
                         Article 45), as well as to criminal prosecution before the national authorities.

                             during implementation of the action or afterwards — carry out audits. 
                           The ECA has the right of access for the purpose of checks and audits. 
                           43          Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules

                         1. ECA checks and audits 
                         The European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the (entirely independent) external auditing body for all 
                         European institutions. As such, it may carry out audits on all recipients of EU funds (including 
                         beneficiaries, third parties involved in the action and recipients of financial support or prizes). 
                         Depending on the outcome, the results of such an audit may be notified to the beneficiary.  
                         If  the  Commission/Agency intends to reject costs on the basis of the findings of the Court of 
                         Auditors, it will inform the beneficiary and give it the possibility to make observations.  
                         If an ECA check or audit shows ineligible costs, substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                         serious breach of obligations, this may lead to suspension, termination, cost rejection, grant 
                         reduction and recovery (see Articles 42-44, 47-50) and to exclusion and/or financial penalties (see 
                         Article 45).

                           [OPTION 1 for international organisations: In conformity with its financial regulations, the European

                             may undertake, including on the spot, checks, reviews, audits and investigations. 
                           This Article will be applied in accordance with any specific agreement concluded in this respect by the 
                           international organisation and the European Union.]

                         1. Checks, reviews, audits and investigations for international organisations 
                         Checks, reviews, audits and investigations may also be made with regard to beneficiaries that are 
                         international organisations (IOs).  
                                             Checks, reviews, audits and investigations must however respect the privileges and immunities accorded 
                                      to an international organisation by its constituent documents or international law. 
                                       
                         If there is a specific agreement concluded with the international organisation (and this agreement 
                         covers  checks,  reviews,  audits  and  investigations),  the  Commission/Agency  will  apply  the 
                         agreement.

                           22.5 Consequences of findings in checks, reviews, audits and investigations — Extension of findings 
                           22.5.1 Findings in this grant 
                           Findings in checks, reviews, audits or investigations carried out in the context of this grant may lead to the 
                           rejection of ineligible costs (see Article 42), reduction of the grant (see Article 43), recovery of undue 
                             amounts (see Article 44) or to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                           Rejection of costs or reduction of the grant after the payment of the balance will lead to a revised final grant 
                           amount (see Article 5.4). 
                           Findings  in  checks,  reviews,  audits  or  investigations  may  lead  to  a  request  for  amendment  for  the 
                             modification of Annex 1 (see Article 55). 
                          
                             Checks,  reviews,  audits  or  investigations  that  find  systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or 
                           breach of obligations may also lead to consequences in other EU or Euratom grants awarded under similar 
                           conditions (‘extension of findings from this grant to other grants’). 
                           Moreover, findings arising from an OLAF investigation may lead to criminal prosecution under national 
                             law. 
                           22.5.2 Findings in other grants 
                           The  [Agency  or  the]  Commission  may  extend  findings  from  other  grants  to  this  grant  (‘extension  of 
                           findings from other grants to this grant’), if: 
                                         (a)  the  beneficiary  concerned  is  found,  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  under  similar 
                                                  conditions,  to  have  committed  systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  breach  of 
                                                  obligations that have a material impact on this grant and 
                                         (b)  those findings are formally notified to the beneficiary concerned — together with the list of grants 
                                                  affected by the findings — no later than two years after the payment of the balance of this grant. 
                           The extension of findings may lead to the rejection of costs (see Article 42), reduction of the grant (see 
                             Article  43),  recovery  of  undue  amounts  (see  Article  44),  suspension  of  payments  (see  Article  48), 
                           suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49) or termination (see Article 50). 
                           22.5.3 Procedure 
                           The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the beneficiary concerned the systemic or recurrent 
                             errors and its intention to extend these audit findings, together with the list of grants affected. 
                           22.5.3.1 If the findings concern eligibility of costs: the formal notification will include: 
                                         (a)  an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings; 
                                         (b)  the request to submit revised financial statements for all grants affected; 
                                         (c)  the correction rate for extrapolation established by the [Agency or the]Commission on the basis of 
                                                  the  systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  to  calculate  the  amounts  to  be  rejected  if  the  beneficiary 
                                                  concerned: 
                                                    (i)         considers that the submission of revised financial statements is not possible or practicable 
                                                                  or 
                                                   (ii)         does not submit revised financial statements.

              The beneficiary concerned has 90 days from receiving notification to submit observations, revised financial 
              statements or to propose a duly substantiated alternative correction method. This period may be extended 
             by the [Agency or the] Commission in justified cases. 
              The [Agency or the] Commission may then start a rejection procedure in accordance with Article 42, on the 
              basis of: 
                 -   the revised financial statements, if approved 
                 -   the proposed alternative correction method, if accepted 
                 or 
                 -   the initially notified correction rate for extrapolation, if it does not receive any observations or 
                     revised financial statements, does not accept the observations or the proposed alternative correction 
                     method or does not approve the revised financial statements. 
              22.5.3.2  If  the  findings  concern  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
              obligations, the formal notification will include: 
                 (a)  an invitation to submit observations on the list of grants affected by the findings and 
                 (b)  the  flat-rate  the  [Agency  or  the]  Commission  intends  to  apply  according  to  the  principle  of 
                     proportionality. 
              The beneficiary concerned has 90 days from receiving notification to submit observations or to propose a 
              duly substantiated alternative flat-rate. 
              The [Agency or the] Commission may then start a reduction procedure in accordance with Article 43, on the 
             basis of: 
                 -   the proposed alternative flat-rate, if accepted 
             
                 or 
             
                 -   the  initially  notified  flat-rate,  if  it  does  not  receive  any  observations  or  does  not  accept  the 
                     observations or the proposed alternative flat-rate. 
              22.6 Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, any insufficiently substantiated costs will 
              be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
              Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
               
             
                     
            1. Extension of findings (rejection and grant reduction) 
            If the Commission/Agency finds (typically in a review, audit or OLAF investigation) substantial 
            errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  which  are  systemic  or 
            recurrent, it may make a correction (cost rejection or grant reduction; see Articles 42 and 43) in: 
                  the grant, both for  
                          reporting periods that where audited/reviewed and 
                          reporting periods that were not audited/reviewed (extension of the findings) 
                  other grants of the beneficiary (extension of the findings).

                ‘Recurrent’ means an infringement found in several grants of the beneficiary (and therefore 
                likely to also have occurred in the other grants of that beneficiary).  
                    Examples (recurrent): In several grants, the beneficiary claimed deductible  VAT  as  an  eligible cost; 
                    increased the remuneration of its personnel solely for its contracts with the Commission; did not clearly 
                    display the EU funding despite the GA’s visibility requirements. 
                ‘Systemic’ means an infringement that is inherently related to the beneficiary’s methodologies, 
                accounting, management or internal control practices (and therefore, by its very nature, likely 
                to have occurred in all other transactions of the beneficiary that are comparable/similar (i.e. 
                governed by the same methodologies, accounting management or internal control practices, 
                and thus part of the same ‘system’). 
                    Examples (systemic):  The  beneficiary  does  not  keep  records  of  a  certain  type  of  transactions;  the 
                    beneficiary set up a fraudulent network to overcharge personnel costs . 
            The findings may be extended both to on-going grants (i.e. grants for which the payment of the 
            balance has not yet been carried out) and to closed grants — up to two years after the payment 
            of the balance.  
            Findings may be extended to all other EU or Euratom grants awarded under similar conditions. 
             
                      Findings will normally be extended only within one programme (e.g. findings in an H2020 audit to all 
                  H2020 grants) but they may exceptionally also be extended to similar programmes (e.g. if justified by the 
                  nature  of  the  findings  and  the  similarity  of  the  applicable  grant  agreements  or  in  case  of  serious 
                  irregularities or fraud).     
                   
             
                   
            2. Procedure 
                      . 
            If findings are systemic or recurrent, this will already have been mentioned in the audit or review 
                       
            report and — like the other aspects of the report — they have been subject to the contradictory 
            audit/review procedure.  
                   
                   
            If the findings  also impact other EU/Euratom grants, the audit/review procedure will be followed 
            by an extension procedure, to fix the list of impacted grants and ask the beneficiary’s views on the 
                   
            method for correction. In order to minimise the administrative burden, this procedure is usually 
            centralised. 
                   
                Procedure for extension of findings: 
                   
                Step 1 —   After the end of the contradictory audit/review procedure, the Commission/Agency 
                             auditors  send  the  letter  closing  the  audit/review  procedure  (letter  of  audit 
                             conclusions), together with 
                                   the final audit/review report  
                                   the list of grants/reporting periods to which the audit findings will be extended 
                                   an invitation to submit comments on the list of grants/reporting periods 
                                   for cost rejection:  
                                           a request to submit revised financial statements for the grants/reporting 
                                            periods on the list (via a specific form annexed to the letter of audit 
                                            conclusions)  
                                           the proposed correction rate for extrapolation (if the beneficiary does 
                                            not submit revised financial statements) 
                                           the  conditions  for  external  counter-audits  to  propose  an  alternative 
                                            correction method (see below) 
                                   for grant reduction: the proposed flat-rate for the correction.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                                The  correction  rate  for  cost  rejection  will  normally  correspond  to  the  average 
                                correction  rate  calculated  in  the  sample  of  audited  grants  (for  the  flawed  cost 
                                category(ies) or even for the total costs claimed). 
                                The flat-rate for grant reductions will normally be based on the relative importance 
                                of the tasks improperly implemented or the seriousness of the breach of obligations 
                                —  compared  to  the  action  (i.e.  calculated  according  to  the  principle  of 
                                proportionality). 
                                    The rate will be used if: 
                                       the beneficiary explicitly requests it 
                                            Example: if the beneficiary considers that the administrative workload related to 
                                            submitting  revised  financial  statements  for  all  the  grants  affected  would  be 
                                            disproportionate or impossible and so it decides to accept the correction rate. 
                                       the beneficiary does not submit revised financial statements or refuses to 
                                        cooperate (in time) 
                                       the  Commission/Agency  cannot  approve  the  revised  financial  statements 
                                        (because they do not properly reflect the audit/review findings) 
                                       the  Commission/Agency  cannot  accept  the  alternative  correction  method 
                                        proposed by the beneficiary.  
                Step 2 —   The beneficiary has 90 days to: 
                                   submit comments on the list of grants 
                                    If the beneficiary considers that some (or all) of the grants on the list are not 
                                    affected,  it  must  explain  why.  If  the  explanation  is  not  sufficient,  the 
                                    Commission/Agency may request additional information or clarifications.  
                                   submit revised financial statements (free of the errors or irregularities raised). 
                                        Example: An  audit  finds  that  the  beneficiary  claimed  the  deductible  VAT  as  an 
                                        eligible cost and qualifies this finding as recurrent. The beneficiary agrees with the 
                                        audit conclusions. It submits revised financial statements correcting the VAT for each 
                                        grant affected.  
                                   if it does not intend to submit revised financial statement, but disagrees with 
                                    the proposed correction rate, the beneficiary may:  
                                          for  cost  rejection:  present  an  alternative  correction  method 
                                           (alternative correction rate), substantiated by an audit performed by an 
                                           independent external auditor  
                                           The purpose of the independent audit can ONLY be to determine a more 
                                           precise    error   rate   for    the   audit/review    findings   of   the 
                                           Commission/Agency (NOT to contest those findings themselves).  
                                          for  grant  reduction:  present  an  alternative  correction  method 
                                           (alternative  flat  rate),  substantiated  by  a  note  explaining  why  the 
                                           alternative  rate  is  more  appropriate  than  the  rate  proposed  by  the 
                                           Commission/Agency.  
                                        
                                       The  beneficiary  must  choose  one  method  for  the  entire  extension  procedure,  i.e. 
                                        
                                  submit  for  all  grants  either  revised  financial  statements  or  an  alternative  correction 
                                  method.  
                                       The  Commission/Agency  has  full  discretion  to  accept  or  refuse  the  alternative 
                                  correction method proposed by the beneficiary; there is NO entitlement to it.  
                                   
                                   
            After the extension procedure is completed, the list of grants and beneficiary position is handed to 
            the operational services which are in charge of managing the concerned grants. They will decide 
                                      . 
            on the actions to be taken in their grants.    
                                       
            The implementation will be done on the basis of the:

                           The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out interim and final evaluations of the impact of the action 
                           measured against the objective of the [EU][Euratom] programme. 
                           Evaluations  may  be  started  during  implementation  of  the  action  and  up  to  [OPTION  1  by  default: 
                             five][OPTION 2 for low value grants: three] years after the payment of the balance. The evaluation is

                           The [Agency or the] Commission may make these evaluations directly (using its own staff) or indirectly 
                           (using external bodies or persons it has authorised to do so). 
                           The coordinator or beneficiaries must provide any information relevant to evaluate the impact of the action,

                         The Commission/Agency may carry out interim and final evaluations of the actions for the 
                         monitoring and evaluation of the H2020 Programme implementation.  
                                             These evaluations have NO effect on the grant. 
                                     
                                  They are based on the performance indicators and issues specified in Annexes II and III to the

                                  H2020  Specific  Programme.  These  performance  indicators  vary  according  to  the  specific 
                                  programme’s objectives. Performance indicators may be refined during the implementation of

                         The necessary information will normally be taken from the questionnaire (that must be filled out 
                         as  part  of  the  periodic  reports).  However,  the  Commission/Agency  may  also  address  specific 
                         information requests to the coordinator (or the other beneficiaries).

                                            This is a best effort obligation: If not already done so, these beneficiaries must ensure that they

                           The beneficiaries must identify and agree (in writing) on the background for the action (‘agreement on 
                           background’).  
                           ‘Background’ means any data, know-how or information — whatever its form or nature (tangible or 
                            intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that:  
                                     (a)  is held by the beneficiaries before they acceded to the Agreement, and 
                                     (b)  is needed to implement the action or exploit the results.

                            If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                            
                            Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Agreement on background 
                         The beneficiaries must identify and agree on what constitutes background for their action (in 
                         order to be able to give access to it). 
                                           Best  practice:  Although  not  obligatory,  beneficiaries  are  strongly  advised  to  agree  on 
                                           background before the GA is signed, to ensure that they have access rights to what is needed 
                                           for implementing the action (and then exploiting its results). 
                                  ‘Background’ means any tangible or intangible input — from data to know-how, information or 
                                  rights — that exists before the GA is signed and that is needed to implement the action or to 
                                  exploit its results. 
                                                     Examples: prototypes; cell lines; patents; database rights 
                                           For intellectual property rights, it suffices that the application was filed before the GA is 
                                           signed. (‘Intellectual property’ being understood in the meaning defined in Article 2 of the 
                                           Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organisation, signed at Stockholm 
                                                                                48

                                           Background  is  not  limited  to  input  owned,  but  potentially  extends  to  anything  the 
                                           beneficiaries lawfully hold (e.g. through a licence with the right to sub-licence). It also 
                                           extends to input held by other parts of the beneficiary’s organisation.

                        Example:  if  a  university  department  participates  in  the  action,  background  could  potentially  be 
                        anything  held  by  the  university  (unless  the  department  has  its  own  legal  personality  and  is  the 
                        beneficiary) 
            The  agreement  may  take  any  form  (e.g.  positive  list,  negative  list).  It  may  be  a  separate 
            agreement or may be part of the consortium agreement (see Article 41). 
            If access to background is subject to legal restrictions or limits, the beneficiary must inform the 
            other beneficiaries — before signing the GA (see Article 25). 
                Example: Beneficiaries may agree to exclude specific background. Such an exclusion may be temporary (e.g. to 
                permit the adequate protection of the background before providing access) or limited (e.g. to exclude only one 
                or more specific beneficiaries). As background is by definition considered to be needed for implementation or 
                exploitation, the impact of such exclusion on the action, particularly regarding an exclusion which does not have 
                a temporary character, should be examined by the beneficiaries.

                           To exercise access rights, this must first be requested in writing (‘request for access’).  
                           ‘Access rights’ means rights to use results or background under the terms and conditions laid down in this 
                           Agreement.

                            legal restrictions or limits, including those imposed by the rights of third parties (including personnel).

                           the actual or potential value of the results or background to which access is requested and/or the scope, 
                            duration or other characteristics of the exploitation envisaged.

                        1. Access to background 
                        The rules on access to background (including conditions and scope of access) are generally the 
                        same as for results (see Article 31). 
                        However, for background there is NO (or a more limited) obligation to give access, if there are 
                        restrictions or limits (legal or otherwise) and the beneficiary has informed the others — before 
                        acceding to the GA (or immediately when additional background is agreed on).  
                                         Example: A pre-existing agreement (e.g. an exclusive licence) which precludes the granting of access 
                                         rights 
                                 By contrast, if a beneficiary contracts on background later, it must ensure that it can comply 
                                 with its access obligations under the GA.  
                        Moreover, the conditions for access are slightly different. Access must be given: 
                                        for the implementation of action tasks: the default rule is royalty-free  
                                         However, if agreed by the beneficiaries before the GA is signed, for background other 
                                         conditions may apply.

                        Example: A beneficiary owns a novel technology needed by other beneficiaries for implementing their 
                        tasks under the action and the other beneficiaries do not bring the same level of background. In such 
                        case the beneficiaries may agree that access to the novel technology to implement the action will not 
                        be on a royalty-free basis. 
                    Best practice: If beneficiaries intend to deviate from the default rule, it is recommended that 
                    this is explained in detail in their proposal. 
                   for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions (see Article 31). 
            Also, there are NO specific access rights for EU institutions, Member States, Euratom, joint 
            undertakings or third parties — except for the option for royalty-free access for users of research 
            infrastructures in actions with trans-national or virtual access to research infrastructure. 
            Access rights are therefore normally limited to other beneficiaries and certain affiliated entities of 
            other beneficiaries, unless otherwise agreed. 
                Example: Beneficiary A used background from beneficiary B to generate its results. Beneficiary A would like to 
                use its affiliated entity A established in a MS to exploit the results. For this, affiliated entity A needs access 
                rights to beneficiary B’s background.

                           Results are owned by the beneficiary that generates them. 
                           ‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action such as data, knowledge or information — 
                           whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is generated in the action, as well as

                                     (a)  they have jointly generated them and 
                                     (b)  it is not possible to: 
                                                  (i)           establish the respective contribution of each beneficiary, or 
                                                (ii)            separate them for the purpose of applying for, obtaining or maintaining their protection (see

                           The joint owners must agree (in writing) on the allocation and terms of exercise of their joint ownership 
                           (‘joint ownership agreement’), to ensure compliance with their obligations under this Agreement. 
                           Unless  otherwise  agreed  in  the  joint  ownership  agreement,  each  joint  owner  may  grant  non-exclusive 
                             licences to third parties to exploit jointly-owned results (without any right to sub-license), if the other joint 
                           owners are given: 
                                      (a)  at least 45 days advance notice and 
                                      (b)  fair and reasonable compensation. 
                           Once the results have been generated, joint owners may agree (in writing) to apply another regime than joint 
                           ownership (such as, for instance, transfer to a single owner (see Article 30) with access rights for the others). 
                           26.3               Rights of third parties (including personnel) 
                           If third parties (including personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary concerned must ensure 
                             that it complies with its obligations under the Agreement. 
                           If  a  third  party  generates  results,  the  beneficiary  concerned  must  obtain  all  necessary  rights  (transfer, 
                           licences or other) from the third party, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if those results were 
                             generated by the beneficiary itself. 
                           If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using the third party to generate the 
                           results.

                (a)  the lack of protection is because protecting the results is not possible, reasonable or justified (given 
                     the circumstances);

              Before the results are disseminated and unless any of the cases above under Points (a), (b) or (c) applies, the 
              beneficiary must formally notify the [Commission][Agency] and at the same time inform it of any reasons 
             for refusing consent. The beneficiary may refuse consent only if it can show that its legitimate interests 
              would suffer significant harm. 
              If  the  [Commission][Agency]  decides  to  assume  ownership,  it  will  formally  notify  the  beneficiary 
             concerned within 45 days of receiving notification. 
              No  dissemination  relating  to  these  results  may  take  place  before  the  end  of  this  period  or,  if  the 
              [Commission][Agency] takes a positive decision, until it has taken the necessary steps to protect the results. 
              26.4.2 [The EU][Euratom][The Agency] may — with the consent of the beneficiary concerned — assume 
              ownership of results to protect them, if a beneficiary intends — up to four years after the period set out in 
             Article 3 — to stop protecting them or not to seek an extension of protection, except in any of the following 
              cases: 
                (a)  the protection is stopped because of a lack of potential for commercial or industrial exploitation; 
                (b)  an extension would not be justified given the circumstances. 
              A beneficiary that intends to stop protecting results or not seek an extension must — unless any of the cases 
             above under Points (a) or (b) applies — formally notify the [Commission][Agency] at least 60 days before 
              the protection lapses or its extension is no longer possible and at the same time inform it of any reasons for 
             refusing consent. The beneficiary may refuse consent only if it can show that its legitimate interests would 
              suffer significant harm. 
              If  the  [Commission][Agency]  decides  to  assume  ownership,  it  will  formally  notify  the  beneficiary 
              concerned within 45 days of receiving notification. 
              26.5   Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
              Such breaches may also lead to the any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
             
                     
            1. Ownership of results 
            Results belong normally to the beneficiary that produced them.

                ‘Results’ means the action’s tangible outputs (e.g. prototypes, micro-organisms) and intangible 
                outputs (e.g. know-how, formulas), as well as related rights (e.g. patent rights and database 
                rights). Results do not include the outputs of activities not described in Annex 1, produced 
                before the action starts, during its course or after it ends. 
                 
                           Record-keeping  
                       Best practice: To avoid or resolve ownership disputes, beneficiaries should keep documents such 
                       as laboratory notebooks to show how and when they produced the results.  
                        
                        
            Specific cases (ownership of results): 
                           . 
            Automatic joint ownership — If beneficiaries have jointly generated results and it is not possible to 
                            
            establish  their  respective  contribution  (or  to  separate  them  for  protection),  the  beneficiaries 
            automatically become joint owners.  
                        
            In this case, the beneficiaries concerned must conclude a joint ownership agreement (in writing).  
                        
                This agreement should cover in particular: 
                       specific conditions for granting licenses (if they are different from those already set out in 
                        the GA) 
                      criteria or principles for ‘fair and reasonable compensation’ to be provided to the other joint 
                        owners, if a non-exclusive license is granted to a third party (if appropriate) 
                        
                        A ceiling for fair and reasonable compensation should be fixed only if the expected results 
                        can be determined with precision already before the action starts.  
                      how disputes will be settled (e.g. via a mediator, applicable law, etc.). 
                    Best practice: To make it easier to negotiate a joint-ownership agreement, the beneficiaries should include 
                    general principles on joint ownership already in the consortium agreement. 
                    The joint ownership agreement will usually require further fine-tuning after the jointly-owned 
                    results are produced, in particular with regard to: 
                          how the ownership is divided (e.g. equally or not) 
                          if and how the joint results will be protected, including issues related to the cost of 
                            protection (e.g. patent filing and examination fees, renewal fees, prior state-of-the-art 
                            searches, infringement actions, etc.), or to the sharing of revenues or profits 
                          how the joint results will be exploited and disseminated.  
            The joint owners automatically have the right under the GA to grant non-exclusive licenses to third 
            parties  against  fair  and  reasonable  compensation  (without  prior  authorisation  from  the  other  joint 
            owners) — unless otherwise provided in the joint ownership agreement.  
                The joint owner that intends to grant the licence must give the other joint owners at least 45 days 
                advance notice (together with sufficient information, to check if the proposed compensation is fair 
                and reasonable). Such licenses may not include sub-licensing. Joint owners are free to agree on 
                different arrangements in their joint-ownership agreement. 
            Joint owners may abandon joint ownership only after the jointly-owned results have been produced (         
            new in Horizon 2020). 
                    Example: Once the results have been produced, the joint owners may transfer ownership to a single owner 
                    and agree on more favourable access rights (or on any other fair counterpart)  
            Joint ownership by agreement — Outside the cases described above, the beneficiaries may also 
            become joint owners if they specifically agree on it. 
                    Example: A beneficiary may decide that a part of its results will be owned jointly with its parent company 
                    or another third party. However, this requires a (partial) transfer of ownership, which is subject to the GA’s 
                    rules on transferring ownership.  
            EU/Euratom/Agency ownership to protect results — If valuable results are not protected (e.g. if 
            the official prosecution or renewal fees for a patent application are not paid), the Commission/Agency 
            may — under certain circumstances — assume ownership of the results.

            2. Third parties with rights on results 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that they can fulfil their obligations under the GA regarding results, 
            by  making  arrangements  with  any  third  parties  that  could  claim  rights  to  them  (e.g. 
            subcontractors, linked third parties, international partners, employees, etc.).  
                Examples (third parties that may claim rights): academic institutions in countries that have a kind of 
                ‘professor’s privilege’ system (according to which researchers may have some rights to the results of university 
                research); employees or students who carry out work for the action (if they have rights under national law or 
                their contract); beneficiaries for which linked third parties carry out a significant part of the work. 
                Examples (arrangements): transferring ownership to the beneficiary; granting access rights to the beneficiary 
                with a right to sub-license. 
             
            Specific cases (third parties with rights on results): 
            Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU (see Article 14), state that 
            any results produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, these other members are third 
            parties that can claim rights on the results. In this case, the JRU member that is the beneficiary must 
            ensure that it can fulfil its contractual obligations under the GA (e.g. with regard to other beneficiaries’ 
            access rights).  
                Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a JRU should inform the other beneficiaries as 
                soon  as  possible,  to  give  them  time  to  make,  if  needed,  appropriate  arrangements  in  the 
                consortium agreement.

                           ARTICLE 27 — PROTECTION OF RESULTS — VISIBILITY OF EU FUNDING  
                           27.1               Obligation to protect the results 
                           Each beneficiary must examine the possibility of protecting its results and must adequately protect them — 
                           for an appropriate period and with appropriate territorial coverage — if: 
                                     (a)  the results can reasonably be expected to be commercially or industrially exploited and 
                                     (b)  protecting them is possible, reasonable and justified (given the circumstances). 
                           When deciding on protection, the beneficiary must consider its own legitimate interests and the legitimate 
                            interests (especially commercial) of the other beneficiaries. 
                           27.2               [EU][Euratom][Agency] ownership, to protect the results 
                           If  a  beneficiary  intends  not  to  protect  its  results,  to  stop  protecting  them  or  not  seek  an  extension  of 
                           protection, [the EU][Euratom][the Agency] may — under certain conditions (see Article 26.4) — assume 
                            ownership to ensure their (continued) protection. 
                           27.3               Information on EU funding 
                           Applications for protection of results (including patent applications) filed by or on behalf of a beneficiary 
                           must — unless the [Commission][Agency] requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible — include 
                            the following: 
                          
                                                 “The project leading to this application has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 
                                                 research and innovation programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018] under grant 
                                                 agreement No [number]”. 
                           27.4               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                           Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                                      
                                      
                             
                                            
                         1. Protection of results 
                         The beneficiaries must — for any results that can reasonably be expected to be commercially or 
                         industrially exploited —: 
                                  –        examine the possibility of protecting them and 
                                  –        if possible, reasonable and justified, protect them  
                                  even if this requires further research and development or private investment. 
                                           Example (no protection necessary): if protection is impossible under EU or national law or not justified 
                                           (in view of the (potential) commercial or industrial exploitation, the action’s objective and other relevant 
                                           elements, such as potential markets and countries in which competitors are located, whether additionally 
                                           protecting a part of certain technology would bring significantly broader protection or not, etc.)  
                                           Best practice: Beneficiaries should consider seeking expert advice to help them decide whether 
                                           and how to protect results.  
                                  This obligation also applies to beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see Article 9).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            The beneficiaries are in principle free to choose any available form of protection.  
                Standard forms of protection: 
                       Patent 
                       Trademark 
                       Industrial design 
                       Copyright 
                       Trade-secret 
                       Confidentiality 
                    The choice of the most suitable form should be made on the basis of the specificities of the 
                    action and the type of result (i.e. the form which offers the most adequate and effective 
                    protection). Although important for commercial and industrial exploitation, IP protection is 
                    not mandatory. 
                        Examples (choice according to the type of result): 
                        1. For an invention: e.g. patent, confidential information. 
                        2. For the design of a technology: e.g. industrial design, copyright. 
                        3. For a website: e.g. industrial design, copyright, trademark. 
                    In some cases, it may be advisable to protect the invention by keeping it confidential, or to 
                    postpone the filing of a patent (or other IPR) application.  
                        Example (better not to protect for the moment): Keeping an invention temporarily confidential 
                        could allow further development of the invention while avoiding the negative consequences associated 
                        with premature filing (earlier priority and filing dates, early publication, possible rejection due to lack of 
                        support or industrial applicability, etc.). 
                    Costs related to protection may be eligible (see Article 6.2.D.3). 
            When  deciding  on  protection,  the  beneficiaries  must  also  consider  the  other  beneficiaries’ 
            legitimate interests.  
                Any  other  beneficiary  invoking  legitimate  interests  must  show  how  the  decision  would 
                significantly harm it (especially commercially).  
                    Example (harm): The protection would lead to the disclosure of valuable background that is held by the 
                    other beneficiary (as a trade secret or flagged as confidential). 
                    Best practice: Although a beneficiary is not required to consult the other beneficiaries before 
                    deciding whether to protect a specific result it owns, beneficiaries can foresee arrangements 
                    (either in the consortium agreement or in separate agreements), to ensure that decisions on 
                    protection take due account of the interests of all beneficiaries concerned. 
            Protection should last for an appropriate period and have appropriate territorial coverage (in 
            view of potential) commercial or industrial exploitation and other elements (e.g. potential markets 
            and countries in which potential competitors are located). Patent applications should identify the 
            rightful  inventors.  Errors  (or  fraud)  in  identifying  inventors  may  lead  to  the  invalidation  of 
            patents.  
               Example (not rightful inventor): an entity systematically designates a head of department as one of the 
               inventors, although it is not true. 
            2. Visibility of EU funding 
            Applications for protection must include the reference to EU funding set out in the GA — unless 
            (technically or legally) impossible (see Article 38).  
                Best practice: Where possible, beneficiaries should make this reference in the language of their

                           ARTICLE 28 — EXPLOITATION OF RESULTS  
                           28.1                Obligation to exploit the results 
                           Each beneficiary must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — take measures aiming to 
                           ensure ‘exploitation’ of its results (either directly or indirectly, in particular through transfer or licensing; 
                             see Article 30) by: 
                                      (a)  using them in further research activities (outside the action); 
                                      (b)  developing, creating or marketing a product or process; 
                                      (c)  creating and providing a service, or 
                                      (d)  using them in standardisation activities. 
                           [OPTION for additional exploitation obligations if foreseen in the work programme: In addition, the 
                           beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — comply with the additional 
                             exploitation obligations set out in Annex 1.] 
                           This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply. 
                           28.2                Results that could contribute to European or international standards — Information on EU 
                                               funding 
                           [OPTION for results that could contribute to standards if foreseen in the work programme: If results 
                             could  reasonably  be  expected  to  contribute  to  European  or  international  standards,  the  beneficiary 
                           concerned  must  —  up  to  four  years  after  the  period  set  out  in  Article  3  —  inform  the 
                           [Commission][Agency].] 
                           If        results  are  incorporated  in  a  standard,  the  beneficiary  concerned  must  —  unless  the 
                             [Commission][Agency] requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible — ask the standardisation 
                           body to include the following statement in (information related to) the standard: 
                                      "Results  incorporated  in  this  standard  received  funding  from  the  [European  Union’s  Horizon  2020  research  and 
                                      innovation programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018] under grant agreement No [Number]". 
                           28.3                Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced in accordance 
                           with Article 43. 
                           Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Exploitation of results 
                         The beneficiaries must take measures aiming to ensure exploitation of their results — either by 
                         themselves  (e.g.  for  further  research  or  for  commercial  or  industrial  exploitation  in  its  own 
                         activities)  or  by  others  (other  beneficiaries  or  third  parties,  e.g.  through  licensing  or  by 
                         transferring the ownership of results). 
                                   
                                           This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific measures to 
                                    ensure that their results are used (to the extent possible and justified).

                The obligation applies only to beneficiaries receiving EU funding (see Article 9). 
                Where possible, the measures should be consistent with the impact expected from the action 
                and the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of the results.  
            If the GA provides for additional exploitation obligations, these must also be fulfilled. (Such 
            additional exploitation obligations will already be mentioned in the work programme/call.)  
             
                     Additional exploitation obligations apply to ALL beneficiaries.  
             
                  
            If  the  GA  includes  the  option  for  information  on  standardisation,  the  beneficiaries  must 
            moreover inform the Commission/Agency on any results that could contribute to European or 
            international standards.  
                Example: The results are produced in an area in which standards play an important role (such as in mobile 
                communication, diagnostics or immunological diseases).

                           Unless  it  goes  against  their  legitimate  interests,  each  beneficiary  must  —  as  soon  as  possible  — 
                             ‘disseminate’ its results by disclosing them to the public by appropriate means (other than those resulting 
                           from protecting or exploiting the results), including in scientific publications (in any medium). 
                           [OPTION for additional dissemination obligations if foreseen in the work programme: In addition, the 
                           beneficiaries must comply with the additional dissemination obligations set out in Annex 1.]

                             programme: Moreover, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 — 
                           disseminate any technical specifications of the results that are needed for interoperability.] 
                           [OPTION for additional dissemination obligations for cross-border interoperability if foreseen in the 
                             work programme: Moreover, the beneficiaries must — up to four years after the period set out in Article 3 
                           — disseminate the deliverables relating to cross-border interoperability (see Annex 1) and any results 
                             needed  for  cross-border  interoperability  (in  particular  common  technical  specifications  and  software 
                           components).] 
                           This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in 
                           Article 36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all 
                             of which still apply. 
                           A beneficiary that intends to disseminate its results must give advance notice to the other beneficiaries of — 
                           unless agreed otherwise — at least 45 days, together with sufficient information on the results it will 
                             disseminate. 
                           Any other beneficiary may object within — unless agreed otherwise — 30 days of receiving notification, if 
                           it  can  show  that  its  legitimate  interests  in  relation  to  the  results  or  background  would  be  significantly 
                             harmed. In such cases, the dissemination may not take place unless appropriate steps are taken to safeguard 
                           these legitimate interests. 
                           If a beneficiary intends not to protect its results, it may — under certain conditions (see Article 26.4.1) — 
                           need to formally notify the [Commission][Agency] before dissemination takes place. 
                           29.2               Open access to scientific publications 
                           Each beneficiary must ensure open access (free of charge, online access for any user) to all peer-reviewed

              The  beneficiaries  must  deposit  the  digital  research  data  generated  in  the  action  in  a  research  data 
              repository and take measures to make it possible for third parties to access, mine, exploit, reproduce and 
              disseminate the data free of charge for any user, at the latest within 30 days after it has been generated. 
              This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
              36, the security obligations in Article 37 or the obligations to protect personal data in Article 39, all of 
              which still apply. 
              As an exception, the beneficiaries do not have to ensure open access, if the [Commission][Agency] agrees to 
              replace the open access obligation by special access rights for third parties that need the data to address the 
              public health emergency. These access rights must include the right to access, mine, exploit and reproduce 
              the data free of charge.] 
              [OPTION 2: Not applicable] 
              29.4    Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem 
              Unless the [Commission][Agency] requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any dissemination 
              of results (in any form, including electronic) must: 
                  (a)  display the EU emblem and 
                  (b)  include the following text: 
                      “This  project  has  received  funding  from  the  [European  Union’s  Horizon  2020  research  and  innovation 
                      programme][Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018] under grant agreement No [Number]”. 
              When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence. 
              For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
              first obtaining approval from the [Commission][Agency]. 
              This does not however give them the right to exclusive use. 
              Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
              or by any other means. 
              29.5    Disclaimer excluding [Commission][Agency] responsibility 
              Any  dissemination  of  results  must  indicate  that  it  reflects  only  the  author’s  view  and  that  the 
              [Commission][Agency] is not responsible for any use that may be made of the information it contains. 
              29.6    Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
              Such a breach may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                     
            1. Dissemination of results 
            Unless it goes against their legitimate interests, the beneficiaries must — as soon as possible (but 
            not before a decision on their possible protection) — disseminate their results (i.e. make them 
            public). 
                Results that are disclosed too early (i.e. before the decision on their protection) run the risk 
                being invalidated. 
                    Example: If a result is disclosed (in writing (including by e-mail) or orally (e.g. at a conference) before 
                    filing for protection — even to a single person who is not bound by secrecy or confidentiality obligations 
                    (typically someone from an organisation outside the consortium). 
                NO dissemination at all may take place, if: 
                       the results need to be protected as a trade secret (i.e. confidential know-how) or 
                       dissemination conflicts with any other obligations under the GA (e.g. personal data 
                        protection, security obligations, etc.). 
                  Security obligations — Dissemination may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are subject to 
              limited disclosure/dissemination in Annex 1 of the GA (see Article 37). 
                   Results  that  contain  EU-classified  information,  can  be  disclosed  only  after  approval  by  the 
              Commission/Agency (see Article 37).  
                  For more guidance on security obligations, see the Guidelines for the handling of classified information 
              in EU research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
             
            The beneficiaries may choose the form for disseminating their results.  
                Standard forms of dissemination: 
                       website 
                       presentation at a scientific conference 
                       peer-reviewed publication 
                The dissemination measures should however be consistent with the ‘plan for the exploitation 
                and dissemination of the results’ and proportionate to the impact expected from the action.  
            When deciding on dissemination, the beneficiaries must also consider the other beneficiaries’ 
            legitimate interests.  
                The  beneficiary  that  intends  to  disseminate  must  give  the  other  beneficiaries  —  unless 
                otherwise agreed — at least 45 days advance notice (together with sufficient information on 
                the dissemination). 
                Any other beneficiary may object to dissemination — unless otherwise agreed — within 30 
                days of receiving notification, if it can show that it would suffer significant harm (in relation to 
                background  or  results).  In  this  case,  the  results  may  not  be  disseminated  —  unless 
                appropriate steps are taken to safeguard the interests at stake. 
                    Examples (significant harm): Disseminating the results would lead to disclosure of valuable background 
                    held by another beneficiary as a trade secret or would make protecting another beneficiary’s results more 
                    difficult. Appropriate steps could include: omitting certain data or postponing dissemination until the results 
                    are protected. 
                    Best practice: Beneficiaries should foresee arrangements (either in the consortium agreement 
                    or in separate agreements) to ensure that decisions on dissemination take due account of the 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29                                             248

                    interests  of  all  beneficiaries  concerned  (and  yet  allow  for  publication  of  results  without 
                    unreasonable delay). 
            If the GA provides for additional dissemination obligations, these must also be fulfilled. Such 
            additional dissemination obligations will already be mentioned in the work programme/call.  
             
                 For more guidance on dissemination and exploitation, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
               
            2. Open access to scientific publications 
            What?  Beneficiaries  must  ensure  open,  free-of-charge  access  to  the  end-user  to  peer-
            reviewed scientific publications relating to their results. 
                ‘Peer-reviewed publications’ means publications that have been evaluated by other scholars 
                (e.g. articles in scientific journals).  
                 
                       Other  types  of  scientific  publications,  such  as  non-peer-reviewed  articles  as  well  as  monographs, 
                  books, conference proceedings and ‘grey literature’ (i.e. informally published material not having gone 
                   through a standard publishing process, e.g. reports), are not covered by the open access obligation. 
                       Best practice: However, to ensure fuller and wider access, beneficiaries are encouraged to provide 
                       open access also to these other types of scientific publications (where possible). 
                 
                       . 
            The requirement of  Horizon 2020 for open access does NOT imply that the beneficiaries  are 
                        
            obliged to publish their results; it only sets requirements that must be fulfilled if they do decide to 
            publish them. 
                    
            Open access means ensuring that, at the very least,  such  publications  can  be  read  online, 
                    
            downloaded and printed — via a repository for scientific publications, a publication platform or 
                    
            publisher site. 
                     Best practice: In order to increase the utility of the publication, beneficiaries are encouraged 
                    to provide additional rights, such as the right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl and mine. 
                    Beneficiaries/authors  are  encouraged  to  retain  copyright  and  grant  appropriate  licences  to 
                    publishers. They are encouraged to use Creative Commons (CC) or similar licenses. CC BY is a 
                    good legal tool for providing open access in its broadest sense. 
            Open access can be provided through: 
                a)  publishing in open access (‘gold’  open access) ‘ 
                    Publishing  in  open  access’  means  that  open  access  is  provided  immediately  via  the 
                    publication  venues,  at  the  time  that  an  article  is  published  (i.e.  in  open  access 
                    journals/platforms or in ‘hybrid’ journals combining subscription access and open access to 
                    individual articles). 
                    Some publishers levy author processing charges for open access publishing. These costs 
                    are eligible (see Article 6.2.D.3), if incurred before the end of the action and if all other 
                    eligibility conditions are fulfilled.  
                        Although publishing in open access already ensures access via the publisher, the beneficiaries must 
                      still deposit their publication in a repository (see below), in order to ensure the long-term preservation 
                     and availability of the publication. This is part of the open access requirement. 
                      
                      
                b)  self-archiving (‘green’ open access) ‘ 
                          
                         . 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29                                             249 
                          
                      
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                    Self-archiving’ means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is 
                    archived by the researcher (or a representative) in a repository and made available in 
                    open access through that repository.  
            A ‘repository for scientific publications’ is an online archive, where researchers deposit research 
            publications, research data and other scientific outputs and can provide open access to them. 
            Repositories help preserve, manage and provide access to scientific outputs. They collect and 
            disseminate  digital  research  outputs  from  individual  research  organisations  (institutional 
            repositories,  e.g.  the  repository  of  University  X)  or  specific  research  communities 
            (thematic/disciplinary repositories,  e.g. Europe PMC for life sciences including biomedicine and 
            health  or  arXiv  for  physics,  mathematics,  computer  science,  quantitative  biology,  quantitative 
            finance and statistics). They can also be centralised repositories, such as for example Zenodo, 
            developed by CERN. 
                    Best practice: Identify the repository that suits your need in the Directory of Open Access 
                    Repositories (OpenDOAR). The Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (OpenAIRE) 
                    can  help  you  to  find  such  repositories.  We  recommend  that  you  use  a  repository  that  is 
                    compliant with the requirements of OpenAIRE and that you use the OpenAIRE database as a 
                    point  of  departure.  OpenAIRE  also  offers  support  services  for  researchers,  by  providing 
                    information on open access requirements, a general Helpdesk and country-specific helpdesks 
                    (National Open Access Desks) that answer questions on open access and Horizon 2020 . 
            Beneficiaries without institutional/thematic repositories may deposit their publications in Zenodo, at no 
            cost to them. 
            Beneficiaries should NOT use a repository with rules which could conflict with open access.  
            A  template  for  an  open  access  clause  addendum  which  can  be  added  to  publishing 
            agreements to enable open access through self-archiving  in  repositories  is  available  on  the 
            Funding & Tenders Portal. 
            How? Open access to scientific publications involves four actions: 
                    1)  Deposit, in a repository for scientific publications, a machine-readable electronic copy of 
                        the  published  version  of  the  publication  (or  the  final  peer-reviewed  manuscript  as 
                        accepted for publication, author’s version).  
                        This must be done at the latest on publication (in some cases, the final version can be 
                        deposited before publication, e.g. once accepted by the journal).  
                        ‘Machine readable copy’ means a format that can be used and understood by a computer; 
                        copies must be stored using text file formats that are either standardised or otherwise 
                        publicly known, so that anyone can develop new tools for working with them. 
                           Best practice: Where possible, the article as published (in terms of layout, pagination, 
                           etc.) should be deposited. 
                    2)   Provide open access to the scientific publication — either via open access publishing (i.e. 
                        via the publication venue AND via the repository) or as self-archiving (i.e. via the repository 
                        only).  
                        Open access must be given: 
                               in case of ‘open access publishing’: at the latest on publication 
                               in all other cases: within 6 months (12 months for publications in the social sciences 
                                and humanities)  
                    3)   Ensure open access, via the repository, to certain bibliographic metadata that identify 
                        the publication 
                          This is needed for visibility, traceability and monitoring.  
                          It must be done in a standard format and include:  
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29                                             250 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                                the terms ‘European Union (EU)’ and ‘Horizon 2020’ or ‘Euratom’ and ‘Euratom 
                                 research and training programme 2014-18’ (depending on the grant) 
                                the name of the action, acronym and grant number 
                                the publication date, and length of embargo period if applicable and 
                                a persistent identifier (e.g. a stable digital object identifier which identifies the 
                                 publication and links to an authoritative version).  
                             Best practice: For ease of tracking, beneficiaries should also include the digital object 
                             identifier  for  ‘Horizon  2020’  (http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601)  in  the 
                             funding acknowledgement field in their metadata.  
                          The metadata compliance of the repository can be checked using OpenAIRE. 
                    4)   Aim to deposit at the same time with action 1, ideally in a data repository, the research 
                        data needed to validate the results in the deposited publication.  
                        This  is  linked  to  rapid  evolution  of  the  concept  of  ‘publication’  in  the  digital  era.  The 
                        underlying data needed to validate the results presented in scientific publications is now 
                        seen as a crucial part of the publication and therefore an important element of scientific 
                        best practice. 
                                 
                              Beneficiaries do NOT have to grant open access to the deposited underlying research data — 
                           unless they are participating in the Pilot on Open Research Data (see below). 
                                 
                            
                            
                   For more guidance on open access, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                                
                               . 
            3. Open access to research data (Extended Open Research Data Pilot) 
                                
            What? Beneficiaries of actions that participate in the Open Research Data Pilot (ORDP) must: 
                            
                  develop a data management plan (DMP) as a deliverable of the project and  
                            
                  give open, free-of-charge access to the end-user to digital research data generated 
                            
                    during the action.  
                            
            The purpose of the ORDP is therefore twofold: research data management and open access. 
                            
                       As of the Work Programme 2017, the Open Research Data pilot has been extended to all thematic 
                    areas of Horizon 2020 (except ERC PoC actions, SME instrument Ph1 actions, ERA-NET Cofund actions 
                    that do not produce data, EJP Cofund actions, and prizes).  
                    Participation is therefore now in principle the default. However, actions may opt out at any stage — 
                    both before signing the GA and afterwards (through an amendment; see Article 55) —, if: 
                        -   participation is incompatible with the obligation to protect results (see Article 27)  
                        -   participation is incompatible with the security obligations (see Article 37)  
                        -   participation is incompatible with rules on protection of personal data 
                        -   participation would mean that the project's main aim might not be achieved 
                        -   the project will not generate/collect any research data or 
                        -   there are other legitimate reasons not to take part.  
                     
             
                         
            Open access to digital research data means taking measures to make it possible for end-users to 
            access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate the data via a research data repository 
                     
            without any charges for them.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                ‘Digital research data’ are information in digital form (in particular facts or numbers), collected 
                to be examined and used as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation; this includes 
                statistics,  results  of  experiments,  measurements,  observations  resulting  from  fieldwork, 
                survey results, interview recordings and images.  
                Only data that are generated by beneficiaries in the course of the action or reused digitally in 
                the action are concerned. Actions are encouraged to digitise any other data and provide open 
                access to them, but they are not obliged to do so. 
                The pilot applies to 2 types of digital research data: 
                       the  data  needed  to  validate  the  results  presented  in  scientific  publications  and 
                        associated metadata (i.e. data describing the deposited research data) and 
                       other data  and associated metadata, as specified by the beneficiaries themselves in 
                        their data management plan. 
                            Examples: curated data not directly attributable to a publication or raw data 
                             
                          Beneficiaries participating in the ORPD should NOT provide open access to specific datasets if this 
                       would go against other GA obligations (e.g. to protect results or personal data) or if the action’s main 
                       objective, as described in Annex 1, would be jeopardised by giving open access to those specific 
                       datasets. In this case, the reasons must be explained in the data management plan, which is a 
                       deliverable for projects participating in the ORDP, see below). 
                        
                 
                        
                A ‘research data repository’ means an online archive for research data; this can be subject-
                        
                based/thematic, institutional or centralised.  
                        
                    Best practice: Useful listings of repositories include the Registry of Research Data Repositories 
                    (Re3data) and the Core Trust Seal certified repositories. One key entry point for accessing and 
                        
                    depositing related data and tools is Zenodo. For further details on general and discipline-specific 
                    repositories visit the EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure.   
            Actions participating in the pilot must moreover develop a data management plan (DMP) as a 
            deliverable of the project within the first 6 months of the project implementation.  
                The DMP must support the management life-cycle for all data that will be collected, processed 
                or generated by the action. It must cover how to make data findable, accessible, interoperable 
                and re-usable (FAIR), including: 
                       the handling of data during and after the project 
                       what data will be generated or reused 
                       what methodology and standards will be applied 
                       whether data will be shared / made open access (and how) and, if any, what data will 
                        not be shared / made open access (and why) and 
                       how data will be curated and preserved. 
                The DMP should be updated (and become more precise) as the project evolves. New versions 
                should  be  created  whenever  important  changes  to  the  project  occur  (e.g.  new  data  sets, 
                changes in consortium policies, etc.), at least as part of the mid-term review (if any) and at 
                the end of the project. 
                    Best practice: FAIRsharing provides a curated and searchable portal of data standards, 
                    databases,  and  policies  in  the  life  sciences  and  other  scientific  disciplines.  For  more 
                    information on disciplinary metadata standards, visit Digital Curation Centre and Research 
                    Data Alliance Metadata Directory. Additional information on DMPs, repositories and the 
                    FAIR principles can be found in this Practical Guide.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                         For  more guidance on data management plans (and a template), see also the H2020 proposal 
                     forms and the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                      
            Costs related to the implementation of the ORDP (e.g. costs for providing open access, related 
            research data management costs, data curation and data storage costs) are eligible if incurred 
            before  the  end  of  the  action  and  if  all  the  other  eligibility  conditions  are  fulfilled  (see  Article 
            6.2.D.3).  
            How? Open access to digital research data involves 3 actions: 
                    1)  Develop a data management plan (DMP) by month six of the project as a deliverable. 
                        The DMP is a ‘living document’ to be revised as appropriate in the duration of the project  
                    2)  Deposit the digital research data, preferably in a research data repository. 
                    3)  Provide  open  access  by  taking  measures  to  enable  users  to  access,  mine,  exploit, 
                        reproduce and disseminate the data free of charge (e.g. for databases: by attaching an 
                        appropriate creative commons licence (CC-BY or CC0 tool) to the data; if the access/use is 
                        not subject to any rights: by indicating that no licence is needed). 
                        Open access must not necessarily be given immediately; for data needed to validate the 
                        results presented in scientific publications, as soon as possible; for other data, beneficiaries 
                        are  free  to  specify  embargo  periods  for  their  data  in  the  data  management  plan  (as 
                        appropriate in their scientific area). 
                    4)  Provide information, via the repository, about tools and instruments for validating the 
                        results.  
                        Where  possible,  the  beneficiaries  should  provide  those  tools  and  instruments  (e.g. 
                        specialised software or software code, algorithms, analysis protocols, etc.). 
             
                 For more guidance on the research data pilot, see the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.  
             
               
               
            4. Data sharing for public health emergencies 
            If foreseen in the work programme/call, grant agreements for health actions will include specific 
            contractual provisions concerning the sharing of research data for public health emergencies.  
            Public health emergencies are for instance:  
                       public health emergencies of international concern (‘PHEIC’) according to the World 
                        Health Organisation, or 
                       public health emergencies under Decision 1082/2013/EU, or 
                       public health emergencies under applicable national frameworks and regulations.  
            What? The data-sharing obligations for public health emergencies refer to any type of quality-
            controlled digital research data (see point 3) and associated metadata which is generated in the 
            action and is relevant for the response to the public health emergency.  
            Personal data must be processed in accordance with applicable EU and national law (including 
            international practices and standards; see Article 39.2). 
            For H2020 actions targeting public health emergencies, the beneficiaries must moreover: 
                   provide a data management plan (DMP) preferably with the proposal or at the latest before 
                    grant signature  
                    The  data  management  plan  should  address  the  relevant  aspects  of  making  the  data 
                    findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR), including: 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 29                                             253 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                           what data the project will generate 
                           whether and how the data will be made accessible for verification and re-use and 
                           how it will be circulated and preserved. 
                             For more guidance on data management plans (and a template), see the H2020 proposal forms 
                          and the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                           
                   for relevant data (as agreed with the Commission/Agency): provide open access within 30 
                    days after it has been generated 
                   for other data: provide open access as soon as possible. 
                If  agreed  with  the  Commission/Agency,  the  open  access  obligation  can  exceptionally  be 
                replaced by special access rights to specific third parties that need the data to address the 
                public health emergency.  
                In this case, the access rights must include the right to access, mine, exploit and reproduce 
                the data free of charge (as further specified by the Commission/Agency, if needed) — but they 
                may be used only for the access needed and only for addressing the public health emergency 
                (i.e. limited both in scope and in time). Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary agrees. 
            For other H2020 actions, the special open access obligation (or the special access rights to specific 
            third parties) is linked to a specific request by the Commission/Agency and limited to datasets 
            agreed with the Commission/Agency.  
             
            5. Visibility of EU funding 
            Any dissemination of results (in any form), even when combined with other data, must include the 
            reference to EU funding set out in the GA (see Article 38).  
                Best practice: Where possible, beneficiaries should make this reference in the language of the 
                dissemination activity (using the text of the GA language version available on Funding & Tenders 
                Portal Reference Documents). 
            Do NOT refer to EU funding when describing outputs of activities that are not described in Annex I, 
            i.e. outputs developed outside the action (in other words for dissemination activities which do not 
            concern results of the action).  
             
                         Combining H2020 & other EU grants — If the outputs were developed in another EU-funded 
                      action (funded not by H2020, but another EU programme, including Structural Funds/ESIF Funds), do 
                      NOT forget the visibility obligations under those grant agreements. 
                       
                       
                       
                           
                          .

                         ARTICLE 30 — TRANSFER AND LICENSING OF RESULTS 
                           ARTICLE 30 — TRANSFER AND LICENSING OF RESULTS 
                           30.1               Transfer of ownership 
                           Each beneficiary may transfer ownership of its results. 
                           It must however ensure that its obligations under Articles 26.2, 26.4, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 also apply to the 
                           new owner and that this owner has the obligation to pass them on in any subsequent transfer. 
                           This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply. 
                           Unless  agreed  otherwise  (in  writing)  for  specifically-identified  third  parties  or  unless  impossible  under 
                            applicable  EU  and  national  laws  on  mergers  and  acquisitions,  a  beneficiary  that  intends  to  transfer 
                           ownership of results must give at least 45 days advance notice (or less if agreed in writing) to the other 
                            beneficiaries that still have (or still may request) access rights to the results. This notification must include 
                           sufficient information on the new owner to enable any beneficiary concerned to assess the effects on its 
                            access rights. 
                          
                            Unless  agreed  otherwise  (in  writing)  for  specifically-identified  third  parties,  any  other  beneficiary  may 
                           object within 30 days of receiving notification (or less if agreed in writing), if it can show that the transfer 
                           would adversely affect its access rights. In this case, the transfer may not take place until agreement has been 
                            reached between the beneficiaries concerned. 
                           30.2               Granting licences 
                           Each beneficiary may grant licences to its results (or otherwise give the right to exploit them), if: 
                                       (a) this does not impede the access rights under Article 31 and 
                                       (b) [OPTION 1 if additional exploitation obligations in Annex 1: the beneficiary complies with its 
                                                additional exploitation obligations (see Article 28.1 and Annex 1)] [OPTION 2: not applicable]. 
                           In  addition  to  Points  (a)  and  (b),  exclusive  licences  for  results  may  be  granted  only  if  all  the  other 
                            beneficiaries concerned have waived their access rights (see Article 31.1). 
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29 or security obligations in Article 37, which 
                           still apply. 
                           30.3               [Commission][ Agency] right to object to transfers or licensing 
                           [OPTION 1 for EU grants: The [Commission][Agency] may — up to four years after the period set out in 
                           Article 3 — object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results, if: 
                                     (a)  it is to a third party established in a non-EU country not associated with Horizon 2020 and 
                                     (b)  the [Commission][Agency] considers that the transfer or licence is not in line with EU interests 
                                              regarding competitiveness or is inconsistent with ethical principles or security considerations.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                     
            1. Transfers of ownership 
            The beneficiaries may transfer ownership of their results. 
             
                         Security obligations — Transfer may be restricted/NOT possible for results that are subject to 
                     limited disclosure/dissemination in Annex 1 of the GA (see Article 37). 
                          For  more  guidance  on  security  obligations,  see  the  Guidelines  for  the  handling  of  classified 
                     information in EU research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                      
            The beneficiaries must however ensure that their obligations (regarding the results) apply to the 
            new owner and that this new owner would pass them on in any subsequent transfer (e.g. by 
            including this in their arrangements with the new owner). 
                Obligations that must be extended to new owners: 
                       Joint ownership-related obligations (see Article 26.2)  
                       EU/Euratom/Agency’s right to assume ownership, to protect results (see Article 26.4) 
                       Protection of results and visibility of EU funding (see Article 27) 
                       Exploitation of results and visibility of EU funding (see Article 28) 
                       Dissemination of results, open access and visibility of EU funding (see Article 29)  
                       Transfer and licensing of results (see Article 30) 
                       Access rights to result (see Article 31). 
            When  transferring  ownership,  they  must  also  consider  the  other  beneficiaries’  legitimate 
            interests. 
                The beneficiary that intends to make the transfer must give the other beneficiaries (that still 
                have  or  still  may  request  access  rights)  at  least  45  days  (or  less  if  agreed  in  writing) 
                advance notice (together with sufficient information to allow them to properly assess the 
                extent to which their access rights may be affected). 
                Any other beneficiary (with such access rights) may object to the transfer within 30 days (or 
                less if agreed in writing) of receiving notification, if it can show that it would adversely affect 
                its  access  rights.  In  this  case,  the  transfer  may  not  take  place,  until  the  beneficiaries 
                concerned reach an agreement. 
                    The mere fact that the results concerned are transferred to a competitor is NOT in itself a 
                    valid reason for an objection. The beneficiary concerned must demonstrate the adverse 
                    effects on the exercise of its access rights. 
                        Example (adverse effect): Beneficiary A intends to transfer ownership of a new process it created 
                        during the course of an action to a competitor of beneficiary B. If beneficiary B shows that its access 
                        rights would be adversely affected by such a transfer (for instance, because the competitor has a 
                        proven track record of systematically legally challenging beneficiary B’s claims), the transfer may not 
                        take place until the two beneficiaries reach an agreement. 
             
            Specific cases (transfers of ownership of results): 
            Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) — If a transfer of ownership is not explicit (through an ‘intended’ 
            transfer)  but  part  of  a  take-over  or  merger  of  two  companies,  confidentiality  constraints  normally 
            prevail (under M&A rules). Therefore, it may be necessary to inform the other beneficiaries only after 
            the merger/acquisition took place (instead of before). 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 30                                             257 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            Specifically-identified third parties — The beneficiaries may (by prior written agreement) waive 
            their right to object to transfers of ownership to a specifically-identified third party (e.g. the mother 
            company or an affiliate of one of them). In this case, there is no need to inform them of such transfers 
            in advance (and they do not have the right to object). 
            Before agreeing to such a global authorisation, beneficiaries should carefully consider the situation (and 
            in particular the identity of the third party concerned), to determine if their access rights would be 
            affected. 
                Example: For large industrial groups, it is sometimes clear from the beginning that all results produced will be 
                transferred to another entity of the group, without being detrimental to the other beneficiaries (who agreed to 
                the global authorisation). 
            In security-related actions, transfers to third parties should only be decided on a case-by-case basis and 
            should be handled with the greatest caution. 
            If  the  Commission/Agency has the right to object to transfers  (see point 3), the beneficiary must 
            formally notify in advance (via the Funding & Tenders Portal) any transfer to a specifically-identified 
            third party established in a non-associated third country — and the Commission/Agency may object.  
            Joint research units (JRUs) — Where the internal arrangements of a JRU state that any results 
            produced by one member are owned jointly by all members, the JRU member that is the beneficiary 
            must ensure that it complies with the obligations under the GA on transfers (placing results under joint 
            ownership of the JRU is a form of transfer). 
            Common legal structures — Common legal structures (CLS) (i.e. entities representing several other 
            legal entities, e.g. European Economic Interest Groupings (EEIG) or associations) that are beneficiaries 
            of an action may want to transfer ownership to one (or more) of their members. This is not prohibited; 
            however the normal rules on transfers apply (e.g. access rights have to remain available). 
                Best practice: Beneficiaries that are members of a common legal structure are strongly advised to 
                agree  on  specific  arrangements  with  the  other  members  of  the  CLS,  in  particular  relating  to 
                ownership and access rights. 
             
            2. Granting licences 
            The beneficiaries may grant licences to their results. 
            They  must  however  ensure  that  access  rights  can  be  exercised  and  that  any  additional 
            exploitation obligations are complied with. 
                Exclusive  licences  (e.g.  for  commercial  exploitation)  may  be  granted  only  if  all  other 
                beneficiaries have waived their access rights and other access rights are preserved, (e.g. the 
                access rights of the EU, Member States and third parties; see Article 31). 
             
            3. Commission/Agency right to object to transfers or exclusive licensing 
            If the GA provides for this option, the Commission/Agency may object to transfers or exclusive 
            licences (or, for Euratom grants, also non-exclusive licences) to third parties established in a non-
            associated third country. 
                      As of the Work Programme 2018, the calls will normally already indicate if this option will be activated 
                   in the GAs. The option may however still be activated (without such indication):  
                          for calls which do not fix the type of research and innovation activities (“bottom-up” calls, such 
                           as FET Open or MSCA) or  
                          in other calls, exceptionally, if justified by the nature of the research and innovation activities or 
                           other action-related reasons.

                Grounds for objection: 
                       Planned transfer/licence not in line with EU competitiveness interests  
                            Example: if the transfer or licence would create a major competitive disadvantage for European 
                            companies or could make the results commercially unavailable on fair and reasonable conditions in 
                            the EU 
                       Planned transfer/licence not consistent with ethical principles 
                            Example: if the transfer or license could cause the results to be used in a way that is not in 
                            accordance with the fundamental ethical rules and principles recognised at EU and international 
                            level 
                       Planned  transfer/licence  not  consistent  with  security  considerations  (including,  for 
                        Euratom grants, the Member States’ defence interests under Article 24 of the Euratom 
                        Treaty). 
                            Example: if  the  transfer  or  licence  could  make  results  considered  significant  from  a  security 
                            standpoint not readily available in the EU, or if security-sensitive results could fall into the hands of 
                            third parties that are considered a security risk 
            This right does NOT apply to results generated by beneficiaries not receiving EU funding (see 
            Article 9). 
            The beneficiary must formally notify the Commission/Agency in advance (via the Funding & 
            Tenders Portal) of any planned transfer or exclusive licence (and, for Euratom grants, also of any 
            non-exclusive licence).  
                A notification before the results are generated is allowed, if the specific results concerned (and 
                the details of the transfer/licence) can already be identified.

                             associated country, if this is needed for those entities to exploit the results generated by the beneficiaries to 
                           which they are affiliated. 
                           Unless agreed otherwise (see above; Article 31.1), the affiliated entity concerned must make any such 
                             request directly to the beneficiary that owns the results. 
                           Requests for access may be made — unless agreed otherwise — up to one year after the period set out in 
                           Article 3. 
                           31.5               Access rights for the EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and EU Member States 
                           [OPTION 1 by default for EU grants: The beneficiaries must give access to their results — on a royalty-

                             policies or programmes. 
                           Such access rights are limited to non-commercial and non-competitive use.

             1. Access to results 
                 
             What & When? The beneficiaries must provide access to results, if it is needed: 
                      by another beneficiary, for implementing action tasks or exploiting results  
                      by an affiliated entity of another beneficiary (established in a EU Member State or H2020 
                       associated  country),  to  exploit  the  results  produced  by  the  beneficiary  to  which  it  is 
                       affiliated — unless otherwise provided for in the consortium agreement. 
                 
             H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 3 > Subsection 3 > Article 31                                                               261 
                40  ‘Complementary beneficiary’ means a beneficiary of a complementary grant agreement. 
                 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                There is NO definition of ‘needed’. The beneficiary owning the results has to assess (on a case 
                by case basis and taking into account the action’s specificities), if the requesting beneficiary 
                needs the access (and may refuse it, if it does not).  
                        Example (results needed for implementation): if without these results, action tasks could not be 
                        implemented, would be significantly delayed or would require significant additional financial or human 
                        resources. 
                        Example (background needed for exploitation): if without these results, exploiting a result would 
                        be technically or legally impossible or if significant additional R&D work would have to be carried out 
                        outside of the action to develop an alternative equivalent solution. 
                    Best  practice:  To  avoid  conflicts,  beneficiaries  should  agree  (e.g.  in  the  consortium 
                    agreement) on a common interpretation of what is needed. 
            The other beneficiaries may waive their access rights, provided that such a waiver is made in 
            writing. 
                Best practice: Waivers should be made only on a case-by-case basis, once the results have been 
                correctly identified, and should not be broader than what is actually necessary.  
                    Examples:  
                    1. If a waiver is made to allow for an exclusive licence, this waiver should not be broader than what is 
                    required for the purpose of the licence (regarding application fields, geographical coverage, etc.).  
                    2. If a waiver is made to allow for an exclusive licence, it may be wise that the beneficiaries agree that the 
                    waiver will lapse, if the license is not granted within a certain period or if the results concerned are not 
                    exploited by the licensee within a certain period.  
            How? Access rights are not automatic; they must be requested (in writing).  
                Best practice: Beneficiaries may use their internal rules to specify how to make such written 
                requests.  
                It may be requested even from beneficiaries who left the action before the end, under the 
                same conditions as from active participants. 
                For affiliated entities (established in a EU Member State or H2020 associated country), access 
                must be requested directly from the beneficiary owning the results. However, the beneficiary 
                owning the results may agree to a different arrangement.  
                Access to results for exploitation may be requested up to one year after the period set out in 
                Article 3 — unless the beneficiaries agreed on another time limit.  
            The agreement by the beneficiary owning the results (on the request for access) may be in any 
            form (tacit, explicit, in writing or oral). 
            In case of disagreement, the requesting beneficiary can better substantiate its request, withdraw 
            it or resort to the conflict resolution procedures foreseen by the consortium (e.g. in the consortium 
            agreement).  
                If  a  conflict  on  access  rights  to  results  is  likely  to  affect  the  action  implementation,  the 
                beneficiaries must immediately inform the Commission/Agency (see Article 17.2). 
             
            2. Conditions for access: Royalty free — Fair and reasonable conditions 
            Access must be given: 
                   for the implementation of action tasks: royalty-free  
                   for the exploitation of results: under fair and reasonable conditions  
                    ‘Fair and reasonable conditions’ means appropriate conditions, including possible financial 
                    terms (i.e. monetary compensation), non-financial terms or royalty-free conditions, taking 
                    into account the specific terms of the granted access.

                        Fair and reasonable conditions includes also royalty-free conditions (        new in Horizon 
                        2020).  
                            Examples (monetary compensation): a lump sum, a royalty percentage, or a combination of 
                            both. 
                            Examples (non-financial terms): a requirement to grant access to technology it has, or to agree 
                            on cooperation in a different field or in a future project. 
                    Best practice: Beneficiaries must agree on what constitutes fair and reasonable conditions, 
                    preferably in writing.  
                    Royalty fees paid for access may be eligible costs (see Article 6.2.D.3). 
             
            3. Scope of access: Sublicensing/Licensing — Additional access rights — More 
               favourable terms — Additional conditions  
            The access rights set out in the GA cover only the access needed. 
                Access  rights  do  NOT  automatically  give  the  right  to  the  requesting  beneficiary  to  sub-
                licence. (If this were the case, access rights to results would be extended — without consent 
                — to virtually any company in the world, including the beneficiary’s competitors).  
                    Sub-licensing is only allowed if the beneficiary owning the results agrees — although such 
                    agreement should not be unduly refused, if the sublicensing is necessary. In this case the 
                    sub-licensing does not have to be royalty-free (even if the access rights concerned are) 
                    and can itself be made subject to specific conditions. 
                        Examples: 
                        1. A university may need the right to sub-license access to results to third parties, to make it possible 
                        to derive value from its own results.  
                        2.  In  large  industrial  groups  it  is  quite  common  that  research  is  conducted  by  one  affiliate  and 
                        exploitation by one or several other affiliates. Access rights enjoyed by the ‘research affiliate’ but not by 
                        the ‘exploitation affiliate(s)’ would raise problems for them.  
                        Best practice: The beneficiaries should agree on the terms and conditions of the sub-
                        licensing generally and in writing (in the consortium agreement or separately). 
                            Examples: In such an agreement, they could foresee that sub-licensing could apply to the results 
                            (or part of them), but not to the background; sub-licensing could apply to affiliates of (some of) 
                            the beneficiaries, but not to other third parties. 
            The beneficiaries remain free to grant licenses (including quasi-exclusive licenses) to their own 
            results, as long as they can guarantee that all the access rights can be exercised. They can even 
            grant an exclusive licence, if the other beneficiaries have waived their access rights. 
            Beneficiaries are free to grant additional access rights to results, beyond the rights foreseen in 
            the GA. 
                Examples: Additional access rights for third parties (e.g. affiliated entities not established in an EU Member 
                State or H2020 associated country).  
                Best practice: Such additional provisions may be included in the consortium agreement or in a 
                separate agreement. 
            Access may also be granted on more favourable terms (e.g. include the right to sub-licence) or 
            be made subject to additional conditions (e.g. appropriate confidentiality obligations).  
                Example: 
                The beneficiary owning the results agrees that another beneficiary may sublicense its access rights to results to 
                its affiliated entity. 
                Best practice: For legal certainty, beneficiaries should to specify these terms or conditions in 
                writing.

            Once obtained, access rights may be exercised as long as agreed by the concerned beneficiaries 
            (e.g. until the patent expires). 
             
            4. Specific access rights for EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and EU 
               Member States 
            If the GA provides for this option, EU institutions, bodies, offices or agencies and/or EU Member 
            States have specific access rights for policy purposes.  
             
            5. Specific access rights for Euratom and its joint undertakings  
            If  the GA provides for this option, Euratom and its joint undertakings (such as the Fusion for 
            Energy joint undertaking) have royalty-free access, for: 
                   developing, implementing and monitoring Euratom policies and programmes 
                   complying  with  Euratom’s  obligations  under  international  research  and  cooperation 
                    agreements in the field of nuclear energy. 
                These access rights include the right to sub-license (e.g. to third parties involved in such an 
                international agreements) or to give the results for use in public procurement, as long as they 
                are only used for non-commercial and non-competitive purposes.  
                    Example: 
                    Euratom is part of the ITER agreement and is committed to disseminating information on technological 
                    solutions developed in the context of ITER projects, and to sharing them on a non-discriminatory basis with 
                    other ITER members and ITER itself. It does this by giving ITER and ITER members royalty-free licences, 
                    including the right to sub-license, for the intellectual property produced, so that they can publicly sponsor 
                    fusion and research programmes. 
             
            6. Specific access rights for third parties 
            If the GA provides for this option, there are specific access rights for third parties, i.e.: 
                   for beneficiaries of complementary grants (depending on the case, royalty-free or under 
                    fair and reasonable conditions)  
                    The additional access rights to results for complementary grant agreements apply ONLY if 
                    (and to the extent that) the access is needed for the purposes of the complementary grant 
                    (i.e.  the  access  is  needed  for  implementing the action tasks under the complementary 
                    grant or for exploiting the results of the beneficiaries in the complementary grant). 
                   for third parties that need it for (cross-border) interoperability (depending on the case, 
                    royalty-free or under fair and reasonable conditions) 
                   for users of a research infrastructure in actions with trans-national or virtual access to 
                    research infrastructure under Article 16 (royalty-free). 
                    These access rights are limited to the research work of the user under the grant (i.e. what 
                    he needs for his research work while he uses the research infrastructure).

                         Charter for Researchers  and the Code of Conduct for their Recruitment.   
                                   The Charter provides a framework for researchers’ activities and career management, and 
                                   includes obligations for researchers, employers and funders. The Code of Conduct provides 
                                   for transparency to the recruitment and selection process, ensuring the equal treatment of all 
                                   applicants. It includes obligations for employers and funders. 
                                    
                                             This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must be proactive and take specific steps to address 
                                      conflicts between their policies and practices and the principles set out in the Charter and Code of Conduct.

                                      measures put in place (see Article 18).

                         List of principles (relating to working conditions): 
                                     Recruitment 
                                     Transparency 
                                     Judging merit 
                                     Selection 
                                     Variations in the chronological order of CVs 
                                     Recognition of mobility experience 
                                     Recognition of qualifications

                               According to these principles, beneficiaries should have a clear policy for recruiting and 
                               selecting researchers, which is publicly available and ensures that: 
                                          all research vacancies and funding opportunities are publically advertised (e.g. via 
                                                                                        53
                                           the EURAXESS Jobs Portal ) 
                                          vacancies and funding opportunities are also published in English 
                                          vacancy announcements include a clear job description 
                                          vacancy announcements include the requirements for the position or the funding 
                                           opportunity, and the selection criteria 
                                          there is an appropriate time period left between publication and the deadline for 
                                           applications 
                                          there are clear rules for the composition of the selection panels (e.g. number and 
                                           role  of  members,  inclusion  of  experts  from  other  (foreign)  institutions,  gender

                                          the  selection  criteria  adequately  value  mobility,  qualifications  and  experience, 
                                           including qualifications and experience obtained in non-standard or informal ways. 
                                     These  principles  also  apply  to  selection  procedures  that  do  not  lead  to  formal 
                                     employment relationship (e.g. award of a research fellowship).

                         1. Gender equality — Equal opportunities 
                         The beneficiaries  must  aim  — to  the extent  possible  —  for  a  gender  balance  at  all  levels  of 
                         personnel assigned to the action, including at the supervisory and managerial levels. 
                          
                                             This is a best effort obligation: The beneficiaries must: 
                                                       aim for the balanced participation of women and men in their research teams

                                      measures put in place (see Article 18). 
                                           
                                           
                                          Examples (measures to promote equal opportunities): transparency of recruitment and advancement 
                                          processes, including gender-sensitive language in vacancies and job-descriptions; plans and conditions for 
                                          career  advancement;  transparent  wage  classification  and  grading  of  jobs; development  of  leadership

                         If a beneficiary cannot achieve the balanced participation of women and men in its team despite 
                         active  recruitment  efforts,  the  reasons  should  moreover  be  explained  in  the  first  periodic 
                         technical report and in the final report (see Articles 20.3 and 20.4). 
                         The Commission/Agency will verify compliance with this obligation, when monitoring the action 
                         implementation and in case of checks, reviews, audits and investigations (see Article 22).

                           States or for activities which destroy human embryos (for example, for obtaining stem cells).   
                           The  beneficiaries  must  ensure  that  the  activities  under  the  action  have  an  exclusive  focus  on  civil 
                           applications. 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that the activities under the action do not: 
                                      (a)  aim at human cloning for reproductive purposes; 
                                      (b)  intend to modify the genetic heritage of human beings which could make such changes heritable 
                                               (with the exception of research relating to cancer treatment of the gonads, which may be financed), 
                                               or 
                                      (c)  intend to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell 
                                               procurement, including by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer. 
                           In addition, the beneficiaries must respect the fundamental principle of research integrity — as set out in 
                                                                                                                                             49

                           This implies notably compliance with the following fundamental principles: 
                                      -        reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis 
                                               and the use of resources; 
                          
                                      -        honesty  in  developing,  undertaking,  reviewing,  reporting  and  communicating  research  in  a 
                                               transparent, fair and unbiased way; 
                                      -        respect  for  colleagues,  research  participants,  society,  ecosystems,  cultural  heritage  and  the 
                                               environment; 
                                      -        accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organization, for 
                                               training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts 
                           and means that beneficiaries must ensure that persons carrying out research tasks follow the good research 
                           practices and refrain from the research integrity violations described in this Code.  
                           This  does  not  change  the  other  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  obligations  under  applicable 
                             international, EU or national law, all of which still apply.

             34.2    Activities raising ethical issues 
             Activities  raising  ethical  issues  must  comply  with  the  ‘ethics  requirements’  set out  as deliverables  in 
             Annex 1. 
             Before the beginning of an activity raising an ethical issue, each beneficiary must have obtained: 
                 (a)  any ethics committee opinion required under national law and 
                 (b)  any notification or authorisation for activities raising ethical issues required under national and/or 
                     European law 
                 needed for implementing the action tasks in question.  
             The  documents  must  be  kept  on  file  and  be  submitted  upon  request  by  the  coordinator  to  the 
             [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52). If they are not in English, they must be submitted together with an 
             English summary, which shows that the action tasks in question are covered and includes the conclusions of 
             the committee or authority concerned (if available).  
             34.3    Activities involving human embryos or human embryonic stem cells  
             Activities involving research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells may be carried out, in 
             addition to Article 34.1, only if: 
                 -    they are set out in Annex 1 or 
                 -   the coordinator has obtained explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see 
                     Article 52). 
             34.4    Consequences of non-compliance 
             If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) 
             and the Agreement or participation of the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 50). 
             Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
               
              
                     
            1. Ethical principles 
            The beneficiaries must carry out the action in compliance with: 
                   ethical principles (including the highest standards of research integrity) and 
                   applicable international, EU and national law. 
                Main ethical principles: 
                       Respecting human dignity and integrity 
                       Ensuring honesty and transparency towards research subjects and notably getting free and 
                        informed consent (as well as assent whenever relevant) 
                       Protecting vulnerable persons 
                       Ensuring privacy and confidentiality 
                       Promoting justice and inclusiveness 
                       Minimising harm and maximising benefit 
                       Sharing the benefits with disadvantaged populations, especially if the research is being 
                        carried out in developing countries 
            H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 34                                                            270 
              EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                     General MGA 
                           Maximising animal welfare, in particular by ensuring replacement, reduction and refinement 
                            (‘3Rs’) in animal research 
                           Respecting and protecting the environment and future generations 
                  The key sources of EU and international law are the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the 
                  European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its Protocols (for 
                  other texts). Another important source is the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
                  Disabilities (UN CRPD). 
              Compliance to the ethical principles and legislation is ensured by the H2020 ethics appraisal 
              scheme (i.e. the H2020 policy on ethics issues in research), which includes all of the following: 
                      ethics self-assessment (by the applicants, in their proposal) 
                      two-stage ethics review, with an ethics screening and, if necessary, an ethics assessment 
                       (by the Commission/Agency, during the selection procedure) 
                      if necessary, ethics checks, reviews and audits (during the implementation of the action 
                       and up to two years afterwards; see Article 22). 
               
                    For more guidance on ethics, see How to complete your ethics self-assessment, Research involving dual use 
                 items,  Research  focusing  exclusively  on  civil  applications,  Potential  misuse  of  research  results  and  more

              2. Activities carried out outside the EU 
              Activities carried out in a non-EU country must comply with the laws of that country AND be 
              allowed in at least one EU Member State.  
               
                   The beneficiaries must confirm in the ethics self-assessment section of their proposal that this 
                   condition is met.  
               
              3. Exclusive focus on civil applications 
              Activities under the action must have an exclusive focus on civil applications. 
              This does not mean that the research results cannot peripherally be useful in a military context. 
              Research related to dual-use products or technologies (usually used for civilian purposes but with 
              possible  military  applications)  is  not  prohibited.  However,  activities  that  focus  on  military 
              applications will NOT be funded. 
               
              4. Research integrity 
              In  order  to  ensure  the  necessary  level  of  research  integrity,  the  beneficiaries  must  follow 
              principles listed in this Article and ensure that the persons carrying out research tasks comply with 
                                                                                   54
              the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity  (i.e. follow the good research practices 
              listed in this Code and refrain from any research integrity violations it describes). 
                  Fundamental research integrity principles: 
                           reliability in ensuring the quality of research reflected in the design, the methodology, the 
                            analysis and the use of resources

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                       honesty in developing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a 
                        transparent, fair and unbiased way  
                       respect for colleagues, research participants, society, ecosystems, cultural heritage and the 
                        environment 
                       accountability for  the  research  from  the  idea  to  publication,  for  its  management  and 
                        organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts. 
            The  Code  constitutes  a  general  reference  framework  and  takes  into  account  the  legitimate 
            interests of the beneficiaries (i.e. regarding IPRs and data sharing).  
            This does not change the other obligations under this Agreement or obligations under applicable 
            international, EU or national law, all of which still apply. In addition, beneficiaries should rely on 
            local, national or discipline-specific guidelines, if such documents exist and are not contrary to the 
            Code. 
            The detailed research integrity obligations were introduced with GA version 3.0. For older grant 
            agreements,  these  obligations  were  however  already  implicitly  included  in  Article  34  (which 
            already provided for the more general obligation to comply with the highest standards of research 
            integrity and the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity).  
             
            5. Activities raising ethics issues 
            If  the  ethics  review  (carried  out  by  the  Commission/Agency  during  the  selection  procedure) 
            identifies an ethics issue, the Commission/Agency will define ethics requirements and include 
            them as deliverables in Annex 1 of the GA. 
                Examples (ethics issues): involvement of patients, volunteers, children or vulnerable populations; use of 
                human (embryonic) stem cells; implication of developing countries; collecting and processing of personal data; 
                use of animals; risk of environmental impact; risk of malevolent use or misuse of research results. 
                Examples (ethics deliverables): to submit to the Commission/Agency a report on certain ethics issues 
                during the course of the action. 
            Other ethics requirements may have been required already before GA signature.  
                Examples (other ethics  requirements):  confirmation  that  the  research  data  of  this  study  will  not  be 
                transferred outside the EU. 
            In addition, the beneficiary must obtain — before the start of the activity for which it is needed — 
            all the necessary ethics opinions, notifications and authorisations (e.g. to ethics committees, 
            data protection authorities, dual-use authorities, etc.). 
                Best  practice:  When  preparing  the  applications  for  such  opinions/notifications/  authorisations, 
                beneficiaries   should    request    the   assistance    of    ethics   experts,    research    ethics 
                departments/committees and of their organisation’s data protection officer (DPO). 
                      Record-keeping — The documents no longer need to be submitted before the start of the action, but 
                   the beneficiary must keep them on file and provide them on request to the Commission/Agency (e.g. in 
                   case of ethics reviews, checks or audits; see Article 18). 
                       The beneficiary must be able to show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the tasks to 
                       be undertaken in the context of the action. 
                       If the documents are not in English, the beneficiary may be asked to provide an English summary. 
                           This summary should show that the opinions/authorisations/notifications cover the action activities 
                           and should include conclusions, recommendations and, if applicable, conditions imposed (e.g. the 
                           use of animals is authorised but limited to a certain number).  
                           Translation costs may (exceptionally) be charged to the action (see Article 6.2.D.3) — at the rate 
                           of non-official translations.

                  The Commission/Agency may carry out ethics checks, reviews or audits, to ensure that the 
                  beneficiaries  have  properly  implemented  the  ethics  requirements  and  obtained  the 
                  opinions/notifications/authorisations (see Article 22). 
                   
                  6. Activities involving human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) 
                  Activities that involve human embryos (hE) or human embryonic stem cells (hESC) can only be 
                  funded, if: 
                            they comply with the Statement of the European Commission related to research activities 
                                                                                                   55
                                involving human embryonic stem cells  (in particular, do NOT result in the destruction of 
                                human embryos) 
                          and 
                                     they are set out in Annex 1 or  
                                     the coordinator has obtained explicit approval by the Commission/Agency. 
                  These activities raise ethics issues and must comply with the rules above (and in particular the

                         ARTICLE 35 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS 
                           ARTICLE 35 — CONFLICT OF INTERESTS 
                           35.1               Obligation to avoid a conflict of interests 
                           The  beneficiaries  must  take  all  measures  to  prevent  any  situation  where  the  impartial  and  objective 
                           implementation of the action is compromised for reasons involving economic interest, political or national 
                            affinity, family or emotional ties or any other shared interest (‘conflict of interests’). 
                           They must formally notify to the [Commission][Agency] without delay any situation constituting or likely 
                           to lead to a conflict of interests and immediately take all the necessary steps to rectify this situation. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may verify that the measures taken are appropriate and may require additional 
                           measures to be taken by a specified deadline. 
                           35.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43) 
                            and the Agreement or participation of the beneficiary may be terminated (see Article 50). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Conflicts of interests  
                         The  beneficiaries  must  ensure  that  the  action  is  implemented  impartially  and  objectively,  as 
                         described in the GA. They must do their best to avoid conflicts of interest. 
                                  A ‘conflict of interests’ exists if shared interests: 
                                                  influenced the contract’s/subcontract’s selection/award procedure 
                                                  influenced  the  contract’s/subcontract’s  price  and  this  does  not  correspond  to  the 
                                                   market price or 
                                                  affected the action’s performance, as measured by the appropriate quality standards. 
                                           These interests may be: 
                                                           economic interests (e.g. unjustified and preferential contracts or subcontracts 
                                                            with connected companies (not based on best value for money, technical merit, 
                                                            etc.)) 
                                                            Examples: 
                                                            1. A beneficiary subcontracts work to another legal entity at above the market prices because it is 
                                                            a shareholder or has economic interests in this other legal entity. 
                                                            2. A university subcontracts work to a consultancy firm owned by a professor carrying out part of 
                                                            the work for the project in which the university participates. 
                                                            3. A university gives a preferential subcontract to its spin-off company: the contract is not based 
                                                            on the best value for money principle (i.e. the price is higher than the general market price for the 
                                                            same type of service). 
                                                           political or national affinity (e.g. beneficiaries or third parties are chosen, or 
                                                            research-related  decisions  are  adopted,  based  on  political  considerations, 
                                                            connections or national affinity) 
                         H2020 > Chapter 4 > Section 4 > Article 35                                                                                                                                                                                       274

                            Example: The choice of an action’s demonstration site is based on national affinities, not on the 
                            site’s merits. 
                           family  or  emotional  ties  (e.g.  contracts  or  subcontracts  made  with  family 
                            members for their benefit) 
                            Example: A husband works for a beneficiary who subcontracts work to an SME owned by his wife. 
                           other shared interests. 
                            Examples: 
                            1. If a beneficiary or third party participates in the action not because of its technical capacity and 
                            objective merits, but because it has a close relationship with someone else working for the action, 
                            and this affects the action’s implementation. 
                            2. If decisions made in the context of the action are taken not according to objective and impartial 
                            criteria, but because of these shared interests. 
                            3. If entities with close ties create a professional relationship with the intention of being part of the 
                            action in order to satisfy other interests, and as a result, the quality of the implementation is (or is 
                            likely to be) compromised. 
            If  there  is  a  (risk  of)  a  conflict  of  interests,  the  coordinator  must  inform  the 
            Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal), so that steps can be taken to resolve or 
            avoid it. 
                This may result in the Commission/Agency putting in place certain measures.

                           ARTICLE 36 — CONFIDENTIALITY 
                           36.1               General obligation to maintain confidentiality 
                           During implementation of the action and for four years after the period set out in Article 3, the parties must 
                           keep confidential any data, documents or other material (in any form) that is identified as confidential at the 
                             time it is disclosed (‘confidential information’). 
                          
                             If a beneficiary requests, the [Commission][Agency] may agree to keep such information confidential for an 
                           additional period beyond the initial four years. 
                           If information has been identified as confidential only orally, it will be considered to be confidential only if 
                           this is confirmed in writing within 15 days of the oral disclosure. 
                           Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, they may use confidential information only to implement the 
                             Agreement. 
                           The beneficiaries may disclose confidential information to their personnel or third parties involved in the 
                           action only if they: 
                                      (a)  need to know to implement the Agreement and 
                                      (b)  are bound by an obligation of confidentiality. 
                           This does not change the security obligations in Article 37, which still apply. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may disclose confidential information to its staff, other EU institutions and 
                             bodies. It may disclose confidential information to third parties, if: 
                          
                                      (a)  this is necessary to implement the Agreement or safeguard the EU’s financial interests and 
                          
                                      (b)  the recipients of the information are bound by an obligation of confidentiality. 
                          
                             Under the conditions set out in Article 4 of the Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/201350, the 
                           Commission must moreover make available information on the results to other EU institutions, bodies, 
                           offices or agencies as well as Member States or associated countries. 
                           The confidentiality obligations no longer apply if: 
                                      (a)  the disclosing party agrees to release the other party; 
                                      (b)  the  information  was  already  known  by  the  recipient  or  is  given  to  him  without  obligation  of 
                                              confidentiality by a third party that was not bound by any obligation of confidentiality; 
                                      (c)  the recipient proves that the information was developed without the use of confidential information; 
                                      (d)  the information becomes generally and publicly available, without breaching any confidentiality 
                                              obligation, or 
                                      (e)  the disclosure of the information is required by EU or national law.

              36.2   Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
              Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
             
             
                     
            1. Confidentiality 
            The beneficiaries (and also the Commission/Agency) must — during the action and for four years 
            afterwards  —  keep  confidential  any  data,  documents  or  other  material  (in  any  form)  that  is 
            identified as confidential at the time it is disclosed.  
             
                     This  is  a  minimum  obligation:  Beneficiaries  may  extend  the  period  and  agree  to  additional 
                 confidentiality-related obligations among themselves (for example, for access rights or third parties involved 
                 in the action).  
                  
                Best practice: Beneficiaries should inform each other (and the Commission/Agency) about any 
                laws that require disclosing confidential information (and to work together to minimise any negative 
                effects). 
                A beneficiary may ask the Commission/Agency to extend the period. This request must explain 
                why and clearly identify the confidential information. 
                     Security obligations — Stricter confidentiality obligations apply for information that is EU-classified 
                  or results that are subject to limited disclosure/dissemination in Annex 1 of the GA (see Article 37). 
                      For more guidance on security obligations, see the Guidelines for the handling of classified information 
                  in EU research projects and, more generally, the Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual. 
                   
                   
            The  Commission/Agency  will  exchange  confidential  information  with  the  European  Court  of 
            Auditors (ECA), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and other Agencies and H2020 funding 
            bodies, to check double funding, pursue fraud and avoid plagiarism. (This is part of safeguarding 
            the EU financial interests).

                  If the GA provides for (one of) these options, the beneficiaries must comply with the security 
                  obligations set out in this Article, in Annex 1 and in the other provisions of the GA (see Articles 
                  13 and 19). 
                  The  options  will  be  inserted  if  the  Commission/Agency  finds  during  the  selection  procedure 
                  (security  scrutiny)  that  the  action  raises  security  issues  and  must  be  subject  to  a  security

                      may affect the project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is your responsibility to avoid this and to 
                      keep  your  project  free  of  such  restrictions  (either  by  adapting  your  project  or  by  obtaining  all  necessary 
                      authorisations to be able to comply with your obligations under the GA). Any potential security issues should 
                      immediately be notified to the Commission/Agency.

                     the project implementation (and even put it at risk). It is your responsibility to avoid this and to keep your 
                    project free of such restrictions (either by adapting your project or by obtaining all necessary authorisations to 
                     be able to comply with your obligations under the GA). Any potential security issues should immediately be 
                     notified to the Commission/Agency.

                           38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results 
                           The beneficiaries must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
                           audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner. 
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 
                             36 or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply. 
                          
                           Before engaging in a communication activity expected to have a major media impact, the beneficiaries must 
                             inform the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52). 
                           38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem 
                           Unless  the  [Commission][Agency]  requests  or  agrees  otherwise  or  unless  it  is  impossible,  any 
                           communication activity related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any 
                             infrastructure, equipment and major results funded by the grant must: 
                                     (a)  display the EU emblem and 
                                     (b)  include the following text: 
                          
                                              For communication activities: “This project has received funding from the [European Union’s Horizon 2020

                                              agreement No [number]”. 
                                              For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is

                           When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence. 
                           For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
                             first obtaining approval from the [Commission][Agency]. 
                           This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use. 
                           Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
                           or by any other means.

                           Any communication activity related to the action must indicate that it reflects only the author’s view and 
                             that the [Agency and the] Commission [is] [are] not responsible for any use that may be made of the

                  The beneficiaries must promote the action and its result, with a comprehensive communication 
                  plan that defines clear objectives (adapted to various relevant target audiences) and sets out a 
                  concrete planning for the communication activities (including a description and timing for each 
                  activity — throughout the action duration). 
                         ‘Promoting the action’ means providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including 
                         the media and the public), in a strategic and effective manner and possibly engaging in a two-
                         way exchange 
                                                                                                                                                     58
                         The beneficiaries are free to choose the type of communication activities . 
                                      Examples: a press release for the general public at the start of the action; an interview in the local 
                                      radio station after a major achievement of the action; an event in a shopping mall that shows how the 
                                      outcomes of the action are relevant to our everyday lives; organising local workshops about the action, 
                                      targeted at audiences for which the action is of interest; producing a brochure to explain the action’s 
                                      work to school or university students to show how interesting this specific research topic can be. 
                               The activities must however:  
                                           be effective (i.e. suited to achieving the action’s communication goals)  
                                           be proportionate to the scale of the action (e.g. activities carried out by a large-
                                            scale action with beneficiaries coming from several different countries and a large 
                                            budget must be more ambitious than those of a beneficiary in a mono-beneficiary 
                                            grant) 
                                           address  audiences  that  go  beyond  the  action’s  own  community  (including  the 
                                            media and the public). 
                                      Ad hoc efforts or mere dissemination of results are NOT sufficient. (Dissemination of 
                                      results (see Article 29) cannot replace communication activities (or vice-versa); both 
                                      provisions must be complied with.)  
                               Moreover, the activities must make the research activities known to multiple audiences 
                               (in a way that they can be understood by non-specialists) and include the public policy 
                               perspective of EU research and innovation funding, by addressing aspects such as:  
                                           transnational cooperation in a European consortium (i.e. how working together has 
                                            allowed to achieve more than otherwise possible)  
                                           scientific excellence  
                                           contributing to competitiveness and to solving societal challenges 
                                           impact on everyday lives (e.g. creation of jobs, development of new technologies, 
                                            better quality products, more convenience, improved life-style, etc.) 
                                           better  use  of  results  and  spill-over  to  policy-makers,  industry  and  the  scientific 
                                            community.  
                               Any communication activity that is expected to have a major media impact (i.e. media 
                               coverage  (online  and  printed  press,  broadcast  media,  social  media,  etc.)  that  will  go 
                               beyond  having  a  local  impact  and  which  could  have  the  potential  for  national  and 
                               international outreach) must be first notified to the Commission/Agency.

                The communication activities during the action must already be part of the proposal (either as 
                a specific work package for communication or by including them in another work package; see 
                the H2020 proposal templates) and be included in Annex 1 and 2. 
             
                  For guidance on promoting the action, see the Social media guide for EU funded R&I actions and the Funding 
               & Tenders Portal Online Manual.  
                
                
            2. Visibility of EU funding 
                     
            The beneficiaries must — during the action and afterwards — ensure the visibility of EU funding for 
            any communication activity related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, 
            etc.) and on any infrastructure, equipment or major result (including prototypes) funded by the 
            grant, by: 
                   displaying the EU emblem  
                 AND 
                   including the reference to EU funding set out in the GA.  
                    Best practice: Where possible, beneficiaries should make this reference in the language of the 
                    communication  activity  or,  for  infrastructure,  equipment  or  major  results,  the  official 
                    language(s) of the country where they are located (using the text of the GA language version 
                    available on Funding & Tenders Portal Reference Documents).  
            The EU emblem and reference to EU funding must be displayed in a way that is easily visible for 
            the public and with sufficient prominence (taking also into account the nature of the activity or 
            object). 
                Examples: a sticker or poster for equipment and major results, a plaque or billboard for infrastructure. 
             
                 For guidance on using the EU emblem, see the Guide to using the EU emblem.

                             compromising legitimate interests, the beneficiary concerned may request the [Agency or the] Commission 
                           not to use it (see Article 52). 
                           The right to use a beneficiary’s materials, documents and information includes:

                                              any channel, public display or presentation, communicating through press information services, or 
                                              inclusion in widely accessible databases or indexes); 
                                     (c)  editing  or  redrafting  for  communication  and  publicising  activities  (including  shortening, 
                                              summarising, inserting other elements (such as meta-data, legends, other graphic, visual, audio or 
                                              text elements), extracting parts (e.g. audio or video files), dividing into parts, use in a compilation);   
                                     (d)  translation; 
                                     (e)  giving access in response to individual requests under Regulation No 1049/200152, without the 
                                              right to reproduce or exploit;

              If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
              Such breaches may also lead to any of the measures described in Chapter 6. 
             
             
                     
            1. Communication activities (EU) 
            The  Commission/Agency  may  use  (free  of  charge)  any  (non-confidential  and  non-classified) 
            information, documents and materials received from the beneficiaries, for its own communication 
            and publicising activities.  
                    Examples (material): summaries for publication (submitted as part of the reports), public deliverables 
                    and any other material, such as pictures or audio-visual material, provided by beneficiaries 
                    Examples (communication activities): using a picture or the publishable summary included in the final 
                    report submitted by the action to write a story about a particularly successful action for a Commission 
                    publication (e.g. Horizon - The EU Research & Innovation Magazine), or for speeches, etc.  
                    Examples  (publicising  activities): providing  on  an  Commission/Agency  website  general  information 
                    about the action such as its name, a project summary, the participating partners, the EU funding, etc.  
                If the use would risk compromising legitimate interests, the beneficiary may request that the 
                material is not used. This request must explain why and include the information, documents 
                or material concerned. 
                If the Commission/Agency needs to edit or redraft the material, it will be careful not to distort 
                any content. 
                Beneficiaries may ask the Commission/Agency to include a copyright notice (e.g. by including 
                such a notice in the material). 
            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Commission/Agency can use the documents or materials 
            by making arrangements with any third parties that could claim rights to them.

                                           GA or protecting the EU financial interests).

                               The notifications are available via the Register of the DPO  (and describe the processing 
                               operations, legal basis, security safeguards, retention period, possible data transfer, etc.). 
                         In addition, for processing that implies specific risks to the rights and freedoms of the data 
                         subjects (e.g. processing of data relating to health), the European Data Protection Supervisor 
                         (EDPS) will be consulted. 
                   
                  2. Right to access and correct personal data 
                  Persons whose data is being processed (data subjects) can contact the data controller or the DPO 
                  (via the contact information in the privacy statement), to: 
                              correct errors in the data, block access or delete their data 
                              complain about the data collection and use, and claim compensation for any damage. 
                   
                  3. Complaints to the EDPS 
                  Persons whose data is being processed by the Commission/Agency can lodge a complaint with the 
                  European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) (i.e. the independent supervisory authority for data 
                  processing by EU institutions). 
                         Best practice: The beneficiaries should first contact the data controller (via the contact information 
                         in the privacy statement), since s/he might be able to solve the problem quickly.

                           The beneficiaries must process personal data under the Agreement in compliance with applicable EU and 
                           national law on data protection (including authorisations or notification requirements). 
                           The beneficiaries may grant their personnel access only to data that is strictly necessary for implementing, 
                            managing and monitoring the Agreement. 
                           The beneficiaries must inform the personnel whose personal data are collected and processed by the [Agency 
                           or the] Commission]. For this purpose, they must provide them with the privacy statement(s) (see above), 
                            before transmitting their data to the [Agency or the] Commission.

                            If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 39.2, the [Commission][Agency] may apply 
                           any of the measures described in Chapter 6.

                         The beneficiaries must process personal data under the GA in accordance with EU and national law 
                                                                                                                                                    60
                         on data protection (in particular, Directive 95/46/EC  and the corresponding national law). 
                                                      The Directive is currently under revision. The new General Data Protection Regulation No 2016/679 
                                                will apply from 25 May 2018. 
                                            
                                ‘Personal data’ means any information, private or professional, which relates to an identified 
                                or identifiable natural person (for the full definition, see Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46/EC).  
                                                   Examples (personal data): name, address, identification number, e-mail, CV, bank account number, 
                                                   phone number, medical records. 
                                           There  are  various  potential  identifiers,  including  full  name,  pseudonyms,  occupation, 
                                           address  or  any  combination  of  these.  Individuals  are  considered  NOT  ‘identifiable’,  if 
                                           identifying them requires excessive effort.  
                                           Certain  categories  of  data  are  more  ‘sensitive’  than  others,  and  these  may  only  be 
                                                                                                                                   61
                                           processed according to specific rules.                                                       
                                                   Examples (sensitive data): racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, 
                                                   trade-union membership, health, sexual orientation, etc. 
                                  ‘Processing  of  personal  data’  means  any  operation  (or  set  of  operations)  which  is 
                                  performed on personal data, either manually or by automatic means. This includes:  
                                                  collection 
                                                  recording

                               Examples (processing of personal data): creating a mailing list or a list of participants; managing a 
                               database; accounting records on personnel costs; time-sheets; project planning with names.  
                         Under  these  laws,  personal  data  must  be  processed  according  to  certain  principles  and 
                                                                                                                                        62
                         conditions that aim to ensure data quality and confidentiality.  
                         The beneficiaries must give their staff access to the personal data ONLY on a need to know 
                         basis, for carrying out their functions under the GA. This means that the beneficiaries must put 
                         in place adequate access controls and retention policies for the various categories of data they 
                         hold. 
                         The beneficiaries must inform their staff (whose personal data are collected and processed 
                         by the Commission/Agency) about the disclosure of their data to the Commission/Agency (by 
                         providing them with the relevant Funding & Tenders Portal privacy statements). 
                               Examples: 
                               1. Before encoding staff data in the Participant Register or into a proposal, the beneficiary must provide the 
                               staff concerned with the privacy statement. 
                               2.  If  in  an  ex-post  audit,  the  Commission  requests  the  names,  CVs,  time-sheets  and  salaries  of  the 
                               beneficiary’s  staff  (to  check  the  eligibility  of  personnel  costs),  the  beneficiary  must  inform  the  staff 
                               concerned and provide them with the privacy statement. 
                         Processing  of  personal  data  is  also  part  of  the  ethics  obligations  (see  Article  34).  Both 
                         provisions must be complied with.

                           the coordinator (on behalf of the beneficiary concerned). 
                           If  the  [Commission][Agency] has not accepted the assignment or the terms of it are not observed, the

                         What? The beneficiaries may assign (i.e. transfer, sell or give) claims for payment (for work 
                         carried out under the action) to a third party, if the Commission/Agency has explicitly agreed in 
                         writing. 
                                    
                                             Assignments of rights under this Article are limited to claims for payment under Article 21. Transfers 
                                     of other rights or obligations (e.g. replacement of a beneficiary by the entity that bought it) are governed by 
                                    other provisions (e.g. amendments; see Article 55). 
                                             Assignment has NO effect on the beneficiary’s obligations under the GA; it remains fully bound by 
                                     them. 
                                     
                                              . 
                                   Only  actual  (i.e.  existing)  claims  for  payment  may  be  assigned  (including  pre-financing). 
                                   Assignment is NOT possible for future claims. 
                                               
                         How? Assignment of payment claims must be requested. 
                                      
                                   The  request  for  approval  must  come  from  the  coordinator,  on  behalf  of  the  beneficiary 
                                      
                                   concerned. It must be in writing and must explain the reasons for the assignment. 
                                      
                         The  Commission/Agency  will  assess  the  reasons  given  and  approve  or  reject  the  request  in 
                                      
                         writing. 
                                   E xamples (reasonable requests for assignment): 
                                   1. Assignment of a claim for payment for work carried out by a research laboratory sold after the end of the 
                                   action (but before payment of the balance) by a beneficiary to another legal entity.  
                                   2. Assignment for the benefit of creditors in a bankruptcy procedure.  
                         If the assignment is linked to bankruptcy, the approval will be subject to compliance with national 
                         law.

             1.  Division  of  roles  and  responsibilities  —  Responsibilities  towards  the 
                 Commission/Agency 
             The beneficiaries have full responsibility for implementing the action (see Article 7) and for 
             complying with the GA. 
                  This means that: 
                          each beneficiary must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the GA  
                          each beneficiary must ensure swift and proper implementation of the action (i.e. that 
                           there are no delays which can be attributed to it) 
                          each  beneficiary  is  responsible  (towards  the  Commission/Agency)  for  the  tasks 
                           performed by its subcontractors and linked third parties 
                          the Commission/Agency is NOT responsible for the implementation of the action and 
                           has NO responsibility for the way in which the action is conducted (or any adverse 
                           consequences).  
             The beneficiaries are jointly and severally liable for the technical implementation of the 
             action.  
                  This  means  that  the  beneficiaries  —  including  any  new  beneficiary  introduced  through  an 
                  amendment — accept that they are together responsible for fully implementing the whole 
                  action — even if one of them withdraws.  
                  If  one of them withdraws, the remaining members of the consortium must carry out the 
                  action as set out in the GA — including the part that the defaulting beneficiary was supposed 
                  to carry out — unless the Commission/Agency expressly agrees otherwise (exceptional; only 
                  for specific reasons). They will have to do this without any additional funding (although — in 
                  case  of  beneficiary  termination  —  the  Guarantee  Fund  may  intervene  for  the  defaulting 
                  beneficiary; see Article 50).  
                            Example:  Legal  entities  A,  B  and  C  are  members  of  a  consortium  that  signed  a  GA  with  the 
                            Commission in order to carry out a research action. One year later, beneficiary C goes bankrupt. 
                            Beneficiaries A and B (or even only A or B) must carry out the entire action as described in Annex 1. 
                      The remaining beneficiaries may later take legal action against the defaulting beneficiary, 
                      in order to obtain compensation.  
                      Moreover, the GA will have to be amended, in order to redistribute the tasks, terminate 
                      the beneficiary’s participation, and/or add a new beneficiary (see Article 50). 
             In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is in principle limited to its own 
             debt and undue amounts paid for costs declared by its linked third parties. It is only for the 5% 
             contribution to the Guarantee Fund that financial responsibility is shared; see Article 21.4).

                                                                                   63
             ERIC (European Research Infrastructure Consortium) : If the beneficiary is an ERIC which does

             members: 
                     monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7) 
                     inform  about  events  or  circumstances  likely  to  affect  significantly  or  delay  the  action

                           The internal roles and responsibilities of the beneficiaries are divided as follows: 
                                (a)  Each beneficiary must: 
                                              (i)       keep  information  stored  in  the  Participant  Portal  Beneficiary  Register  (via  the  electronic

                                                        significantly or delay the implementation of the action (see Article 17); 
                                              (iii)  submit to the coordinator in good time: 
                                                        -      individual  financial  statements  for  itself  [and  its  linked  third  parties]  and,  if  required,

                                (b)   The coordinator must: 
                                               (i)          monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7); 
                                             (ii)           act  as  the  intermediary  for  all  communications  between  the  beneficiaries  and  the

                                              The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary

            1.  Division of roles and responsibilities — Roles and responsibilities within the 
               consortium 
            The general division of roles and responsibilities within the consortium is as follows: 
                       the coordinator must coordinate and manage the grant and is the central contact point 
                        for the Commission/Agency 
                       the  beneficiaries  must  all  together  contribute  to  a  smooth  and  successful 
                        implementation of the grant (i.e. contribute to the proper implementation of the action, 
                        comply with their own obligations under the GA and support the coordinator in his 
                        obligations).

            The beneficiaries must send all documents/information via the coordinator — unless, for specific 
            cases, the Commission/Agency requests them to provide such information directly (see Article 
            22). 
                Example:  
                In  case  of  an  audit,  the  beneficiaries  must  submit  the  documents  requested  directly  to  the  auditors,  if 
                requested so. 
             
            2. The coordinator’s roles and responsibilities  
            The coordinator is the central contact point for the Commission/Agency and represents the 
            consortium (towards the Commission/Agency). 
            For this purpose, the GA imposes a number of specific coordination tasks. 
                Main coordination tasks: 
                       Monitor that the action is implemented properly 
                       Act as the intermediary for all communications — unless the Agreement specifies otherwise 
                       Request and review any documents or information required and verify their completeness 
                        and correctness  
                        The coordinator must check the quality of the documents submitted by the beneficiaries, 
                        including: 
                               reviewing  the  individual  financial  statements  from  each  beneficiary  to  verify 
                                consistency with the action tasks, as well as their completeness and correctness 
                                (e.g. that the addition of the different costs declared by the beneficiary corresponds 
                                to the total amount declared, or that the 25% flat-rate for indirect costs is correctly 
                                calculated) 
                                The coordinator is not, however, obliged to verify the eligibility of these costs (under 
                                Article 6) or to request justifications. Each beneficiary remains responsible for the 
                                cost it declares (both as regards eligibility and as regards sufficient records and 
                                supporting documents to substantiate them). 
                               verifying that all the requested documents are submitted by the beneficiary (e.g. 
                                the summary, the questionnaire etc.)  
                               verifying that the beneficiary submits the documents in the requested format 
                               verifying  that  the  technical  information  submitted  by  a  beneficiary  concerns  its 
                                action tasks as described in Annex 1 (and not something unrelated to the action). 
                       Submit the deliverables and reports 
                       Distribute payments to the other beneficiaries, without unjustified delay  
                       Inform the Commission/Agency of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, if requested to do 
                        so (see Article 44.1.2) 
            The coordination tasks listed in Article 41.2 can normally NOT be subcontracted or outsourced to a 
            third party (including linked third parties). They can NOT be carried out by other beneficiaries. (By 
            contrast, the coordinator remains free — like any other beneficiary — to subcontract or use linked 
            third parties for other tasks; see Articles 13, 14).  
             
            Specific cases (coordinator’s responsibilities): 
            Authorisation to administer — Coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments 
            and coordinators that are public bodies may exceptionally delegate the administration of the payments 
            to another legal entity (third party), in most cases a foundation.

                            The third party must fulfil the following conditions: 
                                               they must have been granted the ‘authorisation to administer’ 
                                      AND 
                                               it must be affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
                                                affairs (and those must include receiving and administering EU funds). 
                             
                                               Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks. 
                                               Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer remain fully responsible for it under 
                                         the GA. 
                                          
                             
                                          
                            In this case, the option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisations to administer must be added to the grant 
                            agreement. The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8 must be that of the entity with 
                            the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
                            therefore be registered in the Participant Register and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will get 
                            its own PIC — although it is not a beneficiary. 
                            The costs of the entity may be declared by the coordinator as in-kind contributions (free of charge or 
                            against payment; see Articles 6, 11 and 12).  
                                                                                                                                                                                64
                            ERICs (European Research Infrastructure Consortia)  — Beneficiaries that are ERICs and do not 
                            have their own resources may exceptionally delegate the following coordination tasks to one of its 
                            members: 
                                              monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7); 
                                              act as intermediary for communications (see Article 17); 
                                              request  and  review  documents  or  information  required  and  verify  completeness  and 
                                               correctness; 
                                              submit deliverables and reports (see Articles 19 and 20); 
                             
                                            ERICs using one of their members remain fully responsible for it under the GA. 
                                      
                                      
                            Scientific coordinator — Non-administrative coordination tasks (i.e. tasks not listed in this Article, 
                            e.g. scientific coordination of the action) can be carried out by any beneficiary. 
                            Such a beneficiary may internally (i.e. within the consortium) be called ‘scientific coordinator’. In the 
                            relationship with the Commission/Agency, it will however NOT be considered the action’s coordinator 
                            (but one of the other beneficiaries). 
                            Costs for scientific coordination can be eligible, if they comply with the eligibility conditions set out in 
                            Article 6.

                            3. Internal arrangements between beneficiaries — Consortium agreement 
                            The  beneficiaries  must  conclude  a  consortium  agreement  to  ensure  a  smooth  and  successful 
                            project implementation — unless exceptionally provided otherwise in the work programme/call.  
                                                Best  practice:  In  view  of  their  importance  for  avoiding  disputes  and  ensuring  a  smooth 
                                                implementation  of  the  grant,  the  Commission/Agencies  strongly  recommend  that  every 
                                                consortium sets up a consortium agreement, even if not mandatory. 
                            The ‘consortium agreement’ is an agreement between members of the consortium, to set out their 
                            internal arrangements for implementing the grant. It is purely internal; the EU/Euratom is not 
                            party and has NO responsibility for it (nor for any adverse consequences).

                                      Research Infrastructure Consortium (OJ L 206, 08.08.2009, p.1) 
                            H2020 > Chapter 5 > Article 41.3                                                                                                                                                                                                                             297 
                         EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                                                                                      General MGA 
                         The consortium agreement should complement the GA and must NOT contain any provision 
                         contrary  to  it  (or  to  the  Rules  for  Participation  Regulation  No  1290/2013  or  the  Financial 
                         Regulation No 966/2012). 
                         The consortium agreement should in principle be negotiated and concluded before the signature 
                         of the GA (i.e. each beneficiary should sign the consortium agreement before acceding to the 
                         GA). Otherwise, there is usually a serious risk that prolonged disagreement jeopardises the action. 
                         Of course, the consortium agreement does not have to remain the same during the lifetime of the 
                         action, it can be modified by the consortium at any moment. 
                         The consortium agreement must be in writing. It may be a simple written agreement or take 
                         some other form (e.g. a notarial deed or part of the statutes of a separate legal entity, such as a 
                         European Economic Interest Grouping, association or joint venture).  
                                  Best practice: The beneficiaries should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of the 
                                  different legal forms, and choose the one that best fits the consortium’s specific needs.

                         4. Relationship with complementary beneficiaries — Collaboration agreement 
                         If the GA provides for this option, the beneficiaries must conclude a collaboration agreement to 
                         ensure a smooth and successful project implementation. 
                         The option will be inserted ONLY for complementary actions (see Article 2). 
                         A ‘collaboration  agreement’  is  an  agreement  between  the  consortium  and  the  beneficiaries  of 
                         another complementary H2020 grant, to coordinate their work under the different GAs. It is purely 
                         internal; the EU/Euratom is not party and has NO responsibility for them (nor for any adverse 
                         consequences). 
                         The beneficiaries of complementary grants must — through the collaboration agreement — create 
                         and  participate  in  common  boards  and  advisory  structures,  to  decide  on  collaboration  and 
                         synchronisation  of  the  activities.  These  boards  and  advisory  structures  complement  the 
                         governance of the project; they do not replace the consortium and other project governance 
                         mechanisms (if any).   
                          
                         5. Relationship with participants of a joint action — Coordination agreement 
                         If the GA provides for this option, the beneficiaries must conclude a coordination agreement, to 
                         ensure a smooth and successful project implementation.  
                         The option will be inserted ONLY for jointly funded actions (see Article 2). 
                         A ‘coordination agreement’ is an agreement between the consortium and the participants of the 
                         third  country/international  organisation  (IO)  action  (see  Article  2).  It  is  purely  internal;  the 
                         EU/Euratom is not party and has NO responsibility for it (or for any adverse consequences). 
                         The coordination agreement should complement the GA and must NOT contain any provision 
                         contrary  to  them  (or  to  the  Rules  for  Participation  Regulation  No  1290/2013  or  the  Financial 
                         Regulation No 966/2012).  
                         Moreover, it must be in line with the consortium agreement. It can NOT replace the consortium 
                         agreement (and vice versa).The coordination agreement should in principle be negotiated and 
                         concluded before any work is begun. The work programme/call may require that proposals 
                         include a draft coordination agreement.

                           42.2               Ineligible costs to be rejected — Calculation — Procedure 
                           Ineligible costs will be rejected in full [OPTION if lump sum foreseen in Article 5.2:, except for lump sum 
                            costs, which will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented]. 
                           If  the  rejection  of  costs  does  not  lead  to  a  recovery  (see  Article  44),  the  [Commission][Agency]  will 
                           formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the 
                            reasons why (if applicable, together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5). The coordinator 
                           or  beneficiary  concerned  may  —  within  30  days  of  receiving  notification  —  formally  notify  the 
                           [Commission][Agency] of its disagreement and the reasons why. 
                           If  the  rejection  of  costs  leads  to  a  recovery,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  follow  the  contradictory 
                            procedure with pre-information letter set out in Article 44. 
                           42.3               Effects 
                           If  the  [Commission][Agency] rejects costs at the time of an interim payment or the payment of the 
                           balance, it will deduct them from the total eligible costs declared, for the action, in the periodic or final 
                            summary financial statement (see Articles 20.3 and 20.4). It will then calculate the interim payment or 
                           payment of the balance as set out in Articles 21.3 or 21.4. 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs after termination of the participation of a beneficiary, it will 
                            deduct them from the costs declared by the beneficiary in the termination report and include the rejection in 
                           the calculation after termination (see Article 50.2 and 50.3).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
              If the [Commission][Agency] — after an interim payment but before the payment of the balance — 
              rejects costs declared in a periodic summary financial statement, it will deduct them from the total eligible 
             costs declared, for the action, in the next periodic summary financial statement or in the final summary 
              financial  statement.  It  will  then  calculate  the  interim  payment  or  payment  of  the balance as  set  out  in 
             Articles 21.3 or 21.4.    
              If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs after the payment of the balance, it will deduct the amount 
              rejected from the total eligible costs declared, by the beneficiary, in the final summary financial statement. 
              It will then calculate the revised final grant amount as set out in Article 5.4. 
               
                     
            1. Cost rejection 
            If the Commission/Agency finds ineligible costs (in particular, following a check, audit, extension 
            of audit findings, review or OLAF investigation), it will reject these costs (— in full, i.e. for the 
            amount that is ineligible). 
                       Cost rejections will be made for violations of cost eligibility rules (see Articles 6, 8-16) and will 
                  correspond to the amount that is ineligible. 
                   
                Grounds for cost rejection (EU): 
                     . 
                       Costs do not comply with the GA eligibility rules (in this grant) 
                      
                        The Commission/Agency will reject costs, if they do not comply with the eligibility rules set 
                        out in Articles 6 and 8-16. 
                       Costs do not comply with the GA eligibility rules (in other grants) 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  also  reject  costs,  if  such  ineligibility  was  found  in  other 
                        grants, if:  
                               the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and 
                               the ineligibility is:  
                                       systemic or recurrent and  
                                       has a material impact on this grant. 
            Rejection of costs can take place at any moment — at the time of beneficiary termination, interim 
            payment, payment of the balance or afterwards. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The procedure differs according to the situation: 
                   if cost rejection leads to a recovery: there will be an ex ante contradictory procedure  
                   if  cost  rejection  does  NOT  lead  to  a  recovery:  there  will  be  NO  ex  ante  contradictory 
                    procedure,  but  the  possibility  to  object  ex  post  to  the  rejection  (payment  review 
                    procedure). 
                In both cases, the Commission/Agency will explain which costs were rejected and why they 
                were rejected. In both cases, beneficiaries can object and bring forward their arguments for 
                disagreeing.  The  switch  to  the  ex  post  payment  review  procedure  allows  the 
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 42                                                            301 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                Commission/Agency however to pay quickly without having to suspend the payment deadline 
                (by postponing the discussion on the disputed costs). 
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5). 
                Payment review procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The  Commission/Agency  informs  the  coordinator  about  the  rejection  of  costs  and 
                           notifies the amounts that will be paid out (notification of amounts due; see Article 
                           21.5). 
                Step 2 —   If  the  beneficiaries  disagree,  the  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to 
                           inform the Commission/Agency of its objections. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the request for review and informs the coordinator of 
                           its outcome. 
            Depending on the moment when costs are rejected, this procedure will be directed either at the 
            coordinator or the beneficiary concerned: 
                   for rejections at the time of an interim payment or the payment of the balance: normally 
                    the coordinator 
                   for rejections after beneficiary termination and after payment of the balance: normally the 
                    beneficiary concerned. 
                If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must immediately inform the beneficiaries 
                concerned offline, via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with 
                proof of delivery, etc.) and ask for its comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries. 
                If it is directed at the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator in later 
                on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).  
                      
                             Information obligation — Beneficiaries do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them 
                         to submit comments. However, they should inform them if there is the risk of a significant impact 
                         on the action (see Article 17.2). 
                          
             
            3. Effects        
                          
            If the Commission/Agency rejects costs at beneficiary termination, it will deduct the rejected 
                          
            amount from the costs the beneficiary declared in the termination report and calculate the amount 
            due to the beneficiary. If the amount is lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments 
                          
            received by the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will recover the difference (see Articles 44 
            and 50).      
                Recovery  at  beneficiary  termination  during  an  ongoing  action  means  that  the  beneficiary 
                          
                should pay back the amount to the consortium. If it doesn’t, the Guarantee Fund will intervene 
                and the Commission/Agency will then recover the amount for the Guarantee Fund. 
            If the Commission/Agency rejects costs at the moment of an interim payment or the payment 
            of the balance, it will deduct them and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly (see Articles 
            5.3 and 21). 
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 1 > Article 42                                                            302 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            If ineligible costs are found in-between payments, the Commission/Agency will reject them at 
            the next payment (i.e. deduct the amount rejected from the costs declared in the next financial 
            statement and calculate the amount to be paid accordingly; see Article 21). 
            If the Commission/Agency rejects costs after the payment of the balance, it will deduct the 
            amount rejected from the costs accepted for the beneficiary at the payment of the balance and 
            calculate a revised grant amount. If the revised grant amount is lower than its share of the final 
            grant amount, the Commission/Agency will recover the difference (see Articles 5.4 and Article 
            44). 
            The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 21.

                           ARTICLE 43 — REDUCTION OF THE GRANT 
                           43.1               Conditions 
                           The  [Commission][Agency]  may  —  after  termination  of  the  participation  of  a  beneficiary,  at  the 
                           payment of the balance or afterwards — reduce the grant amount (see Article 5.1), if: 
                                      (a)   a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                              has committed: 
                                                  (i)           substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                                                 (ii)           serious  breach  of  obligations  under  the  Agreement  or  during  the  award  procedure 
                                                                (including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
                                                                to provide required information, breach of ethical principles) or 
                                      (b)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) has 
                                              committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
                                              recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact on 
                                              this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 22.5.2). 
                           43.2               Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure 
                           The amount of the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                           breach of obligations.  
                           Before reduction of the grant, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to 
                             the coordinator or beneficiary concerned: 
                                    -        informing it of its intention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons why 
                                             and 
                                    -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification. 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the 
                             observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the reduction (if applicable, together 
                           with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21). 
                           43.3               Effects 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant after termination of the participation of a beneficiary, it 
                             will calculate the reduced grant amount for that beneficiary and then determine the amount due to that 
                           beneficiary (see Article 50.2 and 50.3). 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant at the time of the payment of the balance, it will calculate 
                             the reduced grant amount for the action and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see 
                           Articles 5.3.4 and 21.4). 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant after the payment of the balance, it will calculate the 
                           revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned (see Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount 
                             for the beneficiary concerned is lower than its share of the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency] 
                           will recover the difference (see Article 44).

                  1. Grant reduction 
                  If the Commission/Agency finds (in particular following a check, audit, extension of audit findings, 
                  review  or  OLAF  investigation)  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  breach  of 
                  obligations under the GA or during the award procedure (e.g. the action has not been properly 
                  implemented), it may reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities 
                  or fraud or breach of obligations. 
                          
                                 Grant reductions will be made (at beneficiary termination, at the end of the action or after the 
                           payment of the balance) for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations, in 
                           proportion to the seriousness of the error, irregularity, fraud or breach (e.g. in case of fraud the reduction 
                           may be up to a 100%). 
                                If the issues are found before the end of the action, the beneficiaries must take all possible corrective 
                           steps to bring the action implementation back into line with the GA. 
                                   
                                   
                         Grounds for grant reduction (EU): 
                                     Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
                                      grant) 
                                      The  Commission/Agency  may  make  a  grant  reduction  if  a  beneficiary  has  committed 
                                      substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations — either during the 
                                      award procedure or under the GA. 
                                       Serious  breach  of  obligations  covers  all  kinds  of  non-compliance  with  GA  obligations 
                                       (including obligations during the award procedure). 
                                            Example: false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding 
                                       In  practice,  the  most  frequent  breach  is  improper  implementation  of  the  action/non-
                                       compliance  with  Annex  1  GA  (i.e.  if  the  work  performed  does  not  correspond  to  the 
                                       activities described in Annex 1). This will normally be examined on the basis of the periodic 
                                       and final technical reports and, if needed, a project review. 
                                     Substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  OR  serious  breach  of  obligations  (in 
                                      other grants) 
                                      The  Commission/Agency  may  also  make  a  grant  reduction,  if  such  substantial  errors, 
                                      irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants, if:  
                                                  the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and 
                                                  the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations are:  
                                                              systemic or recurrent and  
                                                              have a material impact on this grant. 
                               Reduction for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud was introduced as explicit contractual 
                               ground with GA version 3.0. For older grant agreements, grant reduction on these grounds was 
                               however also possible directly on the basis of Article 135(4) and (5) of the Financial Regulation 
                               No 966/2012 (and in very exceptional cases involving fraud schemes also on the basis of Article 
                                                                                                                                        65

                  Grant reduction can take place: 
                              at beneficiary termination 
                              at the payment of the balance or

                   after the payment of the balance.  
            Reduction at beneficiary termination was introduced explicitly with GA version 3.0. For older grant 
            agreements, there is NO grant reduction at beneficiary termination for serious breach of contract 
            (since explicitly NOT foreseen). By contrast, grant reduction at beneficiary termination is possible 
            for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud — directly on the basis of Article 135(4) and (5) of the 
            Financial Regulation No 966/2012 (see above). 
                 For more guidance on grant reductions, see the Guidance on grant reductions. 
             
             
            2. Procedure 
            The Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure. 
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5). 
            Depending on the moment the reduction takes place, this procedure will be directed either at the 
            coordinator or the beneficiary concerned: 
                   for reductions at beneficiary termination: normally with the beneficiary concerned 
                   for reductions at payment of the balance: normally the coordinator 
                   for reductions after payment of the balance: normally the beneficiary concerned. 
            If  it  is  directed  at  the  coordinator,  the  coordinator  must  immediately  inform  the  beneficiaries 
            concerned offline, via its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof 
            of delivery, etc.) and ask for their comments. It must also inform the other beneficiaries. 
            If it is directed at the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator in copy (in a 
            way that preserves confidentiality).  
                 
                  Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them to 
                      
              submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact on the action 
              (see Article 17.2). 
                 
               
                   
            3. Effects 
               
            If  the Commission/Agency reduces the grant at beneficiary termination, it will calculate the 
               
            reduction at beneficiary-level and calculate the amount due to the beneficiary. If the amount is 
            lower than the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary, the beneficiary 
               
            will have to pay back the difference (see Articles 44 and 50). 
               Recovery at beneficiary termination during an ongoing action means that the beneficiary should 
               pay back the amount to the consortium. If it doesn’t, the Guarantee Fund will intervene and the 
               Commission/Agency will then recover the amount for the Guarantee Fund. 
            If the Commission/Agency reduces the grant at the payment of the balance, it will calculate the 
            reductions for each beneficiary and for the action (if any) and calculate the balance to be paid to 
            the consortium (i.e. final grant amount) accordingly (see Articles 5.3 and 21).

            If the Commission/Agency reduces the grant after the payment of the balance, it will calculate 
            the reduction for the beneficiary and compare the revised grant amount with its share of the final 
            grant  amount. If  the  revised  grant  amount  is  lower,  the  Commission/Agency  will  recover  the 
            difference (see Articles 5.4 and 44).  
            The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 21.

                               The  [Commission][Agency]  will  —  after  termination  of  the  participation  of  a  beneficiary,  at  the 
                               payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any amount that was paid but is not due under the 
                                  Agreement. 
                              
                                  Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt [OPTION if Article 
                               14 applies: (including undue amounts paid by the [Commission][Agency] for costs declared by its linked 
                               third parties)], except for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see Article 21.4). 
                               MULTI-BENEFICIARY: 44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation 
                               If  recovery takes place after termination of a beneficiary’s participation (including the coordinator), the 
                                  [Commission][Agency] will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned by formally 
                               notifying it a debit note (see Article 50.2 and 50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
                                  terms and the date for payment. 
                               If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Agency or the] Commission will recover 
                               the amount: 
                               (a)  by ‘offsetting’ it — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any amounts owed to the beneficiary 
                                            concerned by the [Agency, the] Commission or an[other] executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                                            budget). 
                                            In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the [Agency or the] Commission 
                                            may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                               (b)  [OPTION  1  if  Article  14  applies  and  joint  and  several  liability  has  been  requested  by  the

                                            by holding the third party liable up to the maximum EU contribution indicated, for the linked third 
                                            party, in the estimated budget (see Annex 2) and/or][OPTION 2: not applicable;] 
                               (c)  by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 299 of 
                                            the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty] and Article 
                                            79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012. 
                              
                               If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
                                  be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the 
                               payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the [Agency or the] Commission receives full 
                                  payment of the amount. 
                               Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
                               the principal. 
                               Bank  charges  incurred  in  the  recovery  process  will  be  borne  by  the  beneficiary,  unless  Directive 
                                  2007/64/EC55 applies. 
                               44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance 
                               If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency] 
                               will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the coordinator: 
                                            -         informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;

             Article 21.5) and: 
             
                -    pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                     Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                -    formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                     recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This note 
                     will also specify the terms and the date for payment. 
              If  the  coordinator  does not repay the [Commission][Agency] by the date in the debit note and has not 
              submitted the report on the distribution of payments: the [Agency or the] Commission will  recover the

            1. Recovery of undue amounts 
            If it turns out that — due to early termination, cost rejection or grant reduction (in particular, 
            following  a  check,  audit,  extension  of  audit  findings,  review  or  OLAF  investigation)  —  the 
            Commission/Agency has paid too much, it will recover the amount that is undue.  
                 
                       The Commission/Agency will recover the undue amounts from the beneficiary that owes the money 
                  (i.e. with a debt towards the Commission/Agency). 
                       In case of recovery, each beneficiary’s financial responsibility is normally limited to its own debt 
                       (including undue amounts paid for costs declared by its linked third parties, if any). Only the 
                       responsibility for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (i.e. the 5% withheld from the pre-
                       financing; see Article 21.4) is shared. 
                       If the Commission/Agency has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party (see 
                       Article  14),  it  may  recover  also  from  the  linked  third  party.  The  linked  third  party’s  financial 
                       responsibility (for the debt of the beneficiary) is limited to its maximum grant amount in Annex 2. 
                   
                   
                Grounds for recovery (EU): 
                       . 
                       Commission/Agency paid too much 
                         The Commission/Agency will make a recovery, if the amounts paid out exceed the amounts 
                        that are due for the grant. 
            Recovery normally takes place only at payment of the balance or afterwards. Exceptionally, it 
                   
            can take place before, if a beneficiary’s participation is terminated. 
                   
                The Commission/Agency will recover after beneficiary termination if the beneficiary did not pay 
                   
                back  to  the  coordinator  the  amounts  it  received  in  excess  and  —  following  this  —  the 
                Guarantee Fund had to intervene (see Article 50).  
                   
                The Commission/Agency will recover at the payment of the balance if the sum of the pre-
                financing and the interim payments exceeds the final grant amount (see Articles 5.3 and 21). 
                The Commission/Agency will recover after payment of the balance if — due to cost rejection or 
                grant reduction (in particular, following a check, audit, extension of audit findings or OLAF 
                investigation)  —  it  finds  out  that  it  has  paid  in  excess  (or  that  the  coordinator  did  not 
                distribute the payments received; see Article 5.4). 
            The detailed calculations for all cases are described in Article 21. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The basic procedure for recovery is almost always the same: After a contradictory procedure, 
            the Commission/Agency claims repayment of the amounts and then enforces recovery. 
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it (notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and issues a debit note.

                         Enforced recovery: 
                         If the coordinator/beneficiary concerned does not pay by the date set out in the debit note, the 
                         Commission or the Agency will recover the amount (with interest at the rate set out in Article 
                         21.11), in one of the following ways: 
                                                                66
                                     by offsetting it  
                                      ‘Offsetting’ means to deduct the amount the debtor owes to the Commission/Agency from 
                                      another  amount  that  the  Commission/Agency  owes  to  debtor.  With  the  offsetting  both 
                                      amounts are considered paid. 
                                       
                                                             Offsetting is normally implemented as a public law measure (i.e. directly on the 
                                                       basis  of  Article  80(1)  of  the  the  Financial  Regulation  No  966/2012).  Therefore,  the 
                                                       dispute  settlement  normally  follows  the  public  law  remedies  (i.e.  Article  263  TFEU 
                                                       action; see Article 57.2).  
                                                       For the cases not covered by the Financial Regulation, offsetting will — exceptionally — 
                                                       be implemented as a purely contractual measure (e.g. offsetting with Commission 
                                                       and Agency claims, offsetting  against  international  organisations).  In  this  case,  the 
                                                       normal contractual means for dispute settlement apply (i.e. Article 272 TFEU action, 
                                                       arbitration, etc.; see Article 57.2). 
                                                        
                                                        
                                      Normally, offsetting is carried out after the payment deadline has expired. However, in 
                                      exceptional circumstances, the Commission or the Agency may offset before this date, in 
                                                             .                                                 67

                                      If the offsetting takes place after the deadline for payment has expired, the interest must 
                                      also be offset. The interest is normally offset first, before the principal amount.

                                                   The decision describes the claim and its grounds, notes that the debtor has not paid 
                                                   (despite having been sent a debit note and reminders) and indicates the amount of 
                                                   the debt. 
                                                    
                                                           Enforceable decisions are public law measures (i.e. taken directly on the basis of

                                                     normally follows the public law remedies (i.e. Article 263 TFEU action; see Article 57.2).

                                This  decision  —  duly  endorsed  with  the  order  for  enforcement  issued  by  the 
                                competent authority in the Member State concerned — allows to have the debtor’s 
                                assets seized. 
            The contradictory procedure will normally be combined with the contradictory procedure for 
            cost rejection and/or grant reduction (if any). 
             
            Specific case (recoveries): 
            International organisations — Enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU (and other public law 
            decisions) will NOT be taken against international organisations, where this would be contrary to the 
            privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents or international law  (see Article 
            53.2).  
            Offsetting is — by contrast — a measure that may be taken in relation to international organisations, 
            however NOT as public law measure (i.e. not on the basis of Article 80(1) of the Financial Regulation No 
            966/2012), but as a purely contractual measure (i.e. on the basis of Article 44 of the GA). Offsetting for 
            international organisations will therefore be subject to the contractual means for dispute settlement 
            (i.e. arbitration; see Article 57.2).

                           In  addition  to  contractual  measures,  the  [Agency  or  the]  Commission  may  also  adopt  administrative 
                           sanctions under Articles 106 and 131(4) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012 (i.e. exclusion from future 
                             procurement contracts, grants, prizes and expert contracts and/or financial penalties).

                         If  the  Commission/Agency  finds  (in  particular,  following  a  check,  audit,  review  or  OLAF 
                         investigation) that a beneficiary is in an exclusion situation under Article 106(1) of the Financial 
                         Regulation  No  966/2012,  it  may  impose  administrative  sanctions  (—  in  proportion  to  the 
                         seriousness of the misconduct). 
                                            
                                               Administrative sanctions (financial penalties and/or exclusion from future procurement contracts, 
                                            
                                      grants and expert contracts) are public law measures (i.e. taken directly on the basis of Articles 106 and 
                                      131(4)  of  the  Financial  Regulation  No  966/2012)    that  may  be  applied  in  addition  to  the  contractual 
                                            
                                      measures  (i.e.  cost  rejection,  grant  reduction,  recovery,  suspension  and  termination),  for  serious 
                                      misconducts  (substantial errors, irregularities or fraud,  serious breach of obligations, bankruptcy, non-
                                      compliance with tax or social security obligations,  grave professional  misconduct,  fraud,  corruption, or 
                                      criminal/illegal activity). 
                                               Examples: plagiarism; absence of time recording systems (although required); false declaration concerning 
                                               SME status.  
                                     
                                   
                                               . 
                         The maximum sanctions are as follows: 
                                                
                                          for exclusion: up to 5 years from the date on which the Commission/Agency establishes 
                                           the infringement, i.e. confirms the sanction and formally notifies this to the beneficiary. 
                                           If, in that time, the beneficiary commits the same infringement again, the exclusion period 
                                           may be extended to 10 years. 
                                       
                                     for financial penalties: between 2% and 10% of the maximum EU contribution to the 
                                           beneficiary concerned according to the estimated budget (Annex 2) — depending on the 
                                        seriousness of the infringement. 
                                           If, within five years of the first infringement being established, the beneficiary commits the 
                                           same infringement again, the rate may be increased to between 4% and 20%. 
                         The decision to apply an administrative sanction may be published on the Commission/Agency 
                         websites (— together with the name of the person responsible for the misconduct, information on 
                         the misconduct and the duration of the exclusion and/or amount of the financial penalty). 
                         When  deciding  on  publishing  this  information  or  not,  the  Commission/Agency  will  take  into 
                         account, in particular: 
                                         the  seriousness  of  the  misconduct  (including  impact  on  the  EU  financial  interest  and 
                                          image) 
                                         the time that has elapsed since it took place 
                                         the duration and recurrence of the misconduct

            966/2012 (i.e. contradictory procedure, panel, decision). 
            If the Commission/Agency imposes a financial penalty, it will also issue a debit note to recover 
            the amount.  
            If the penalty is not paid by the date set out in the debit note, late-payment interest will be added 
            to the amount to be recovered. 
            However, there is NO: 
                   intervention of the Guarantee Fund 
                   joint and several liability of linked third parties. 
             
            Specific case (administrative sanctions): 
            International  organisations  —  Decisions  on  administrative  sanctions  (and  other  public  law 
            decisions) will not be taken against international organisations, where this would be contrary to 
            the privileges and immunities accorded by their constituent documents or international law (see 
            Article 53.2).

                           SECTION 2  LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES 
                           ARTICLE 46 — LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES 
                           46.1               Liability of the [Commission][Agency] 
                           The [Commission][Agency] cannot be held liable for any damage caused to the beneficiaries or to third 
                           parties as a consequence of implementing the Agreement, including for gross negligence. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any of the beneficiaries or third 
                           parties involved in the action, as a consequence of implementing the Agreement. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Liability for damages (EU) 
                         The Commission/Agency can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the GA — its own services 
                         cause damage (to a beneficiary or third party). 
                         Moreover, the Commission/Agency can NOT be held liable if — in implementing the GA — a 
                         beneficiary or third party involved in the action causes damage (to another beneficiary or third 
                         party). 
                                  Examples:  
                                  1. An experiment carried out by a beneficiary leads to an accidental escape of pollutants into the local river. 
                                  2. A fire breaks out in a beneficiary’s laboratory in the course of an experiment for the action. 
                         Subsidiary (secondary) liability is also excluded. 
                         Non-liability extends to damages caused by third parties involved in the action (i.e. linked third 
                         parties, third parties providing in-kind contributions, subcontractors etc.; see Article 8).

                           46.2               Liability of the beneficiaries 
                           Except  in  case  of  force  majeure  (see  Article  51),  the  beneficiaries  must  compensate  the 
                           [Commission][Agency] for any damage it sustains as a result of the implementation of the action or because 
                             the action was not implemented in full compliance with the Agreement.  
                            
                                            
                         1. Liability for damages (consortium) 
                         If  a  beneficiary  causes  damage  to  the  Commission/Agency  (in  implementing  the  action),  the 
                         Commission/Agency may claim compensation).  
                                  Examples:    
                                  1. Costs of legal proceedings borne by the Commission. 
                                  2. At a meeting on Commission premises, a beneficiary smokes and causes a fire.  
                          
                         2. Procedure  
                         The Commission/Agency will follow the normal procedure for damages claims (i.e. bringing an 
                         action for contractual damages before the European Court of Justice; not direct claim via a debit 
                         note).

                         ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
                           SECTION 3                            SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION 
                           ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
                           47.1               Conditions 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 
                           21.4) if a request for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:  
                                     (a)  it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Article 20);  
                                     (b)  the technical reports or financial reports have not been submitted or are not complete or additional 
                                              information is needed, or 
                          
                                     (c)  there is doubt about the eligibility of the costs declared in the financial statements and additional 
                                              checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary. 
                           47.2               Procedure 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.  
                           The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52).  
                           If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
                           and the remaining period will resume. 
                           If  the  suspension  exceeds  two  months,  the  coordinator  may  request  the  [Commission][Agency]  if  the 
                             suspension will continue.  
                           If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the technical or financial reports 
                           (see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, 
                             the [Commission][Agency] may also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see 
                           Article 50.3.1(l)). 
                            
                                            
                         1. Suspension of the payment deadline (EU) 
                         The Commission/Agency may stop the clock (suspend the deadline) if a payment request cannot 
                         be immediately approved, on the grounds listed in this Article. 
                                   
                                              Suspension of  the  payment  deadline must be  distinguished from suspension of payments (see 
                                    Article 48). Suspension of the payment deadline is an ad hoc measure regarding the request for payment. 
                                      Suspension of payments is a measure to avoid making payments to a beneficiary which is, for example, 
                                    suspected of serious misconducts. 
                                     
                                       
                                  Grounds for suspension of the payment deadline (EU): 
                                                  Payment request does not comply with the provisions of the GA 
                                                   The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any of their 
                                                   documents) do not fulfil the requirements set out in Article 20.  
                                       
                         H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 47                                                                                                                                                                                       319

                            Examples:  the  certificate  on  the  financial  statements  does  not  comply  with  the  template; 
                            inconsistencies in the technical report (meaning that the action cannot be assessed); the financial 
                            statement contains errors. 
                       Payment request is incomplete or requires clarification 
                        The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if the reports (or any of their 
                        documents) are incomplete or it needs additional information. 
                            Examples: the reports, the certificate on the financial statement or other supporting documents 
                            are missing; the information in the periodic technical report is incomplete; additional information 
                            on the coordinator's new bank account is needed 
                       Doubts on the eligibility  of  costs  in  the  financial  statements  that  require  additional 
                        verifications 
                        The Commission/Agency may suspend the payment deadline, if it has doubts (e.g. due to 
                        audit findings in other grants) on the eligibility of the costs in the financial statements and 
                        additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are needed. 
                            Example: The costs claimed in the financial statements are not consistent with the action tasks 
                            described in the technical report. 
                    In practice, suspension is needed if there are issues with the payment request or with the costs 
                    declared which make it impossible for the Commission/Agency to comply with the payment 
                    deadline  (i.e.  for  interim  payments  and  payment  of  the  balance:  90  days  after  payment 
                    request; see Article 21). 
            Suspension starts on the day the notification (announcing suspension) is sent to the coordinator 
            (and ends on the day it is lifted).  
            Late payment without suspension of the payment deadline gives rise to late-payment interest 
            for the beneficiaries (see Article 21.11). 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The Commission/Agency will immediately formally notify the coordinator of the suspension of the 
            payment deadline and explain the reasons why. 
            There is NO ex ante contradictory procedure. However, if the suspension exceeds two months, 
            the coordinator may ask the Commission/Agency if the suspension is to be continued (i.e. ask to 
            confirm it or lift it).  
             
            3. Effects 
            If  the  issues  have  been  resolved  satisfactorily  (e.g.  the  coordinator  sent  the  requested 
            information or re-submitted the report) or the Commission/Agency has finished the necessary 
            verifications (e.g. an audit), it will lift the suspension and formally notify the coordinator.  
            Suspension will normally last until it is possible to make all the necessary checks and verifications 
            that  are  needed  for  the  payment  (e.g.  analysis  of  technical  reports  and  financial  statements, 
            eligibility  of  claimed  costs,  calculation  of  amount  to  be  paid,  approval  and  authorisation  of 
            payment). 
            With the lifting of the suspension, the remaining payment period starts to run again. 
            If a deadline has been suspended for several reasons, it will be lifted only when the consortium 
            has satisfactorily addressed ALL the reasons.

                                                                to provide required information, breach of ethical principles) or 
                                     (b)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) has 
                                              committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
                                              recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact on 
                                              this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 22.5.2).  
                           If  payments are suspended for one or more beneficiaries, the [Commission][Agency] will make partial 
                           payment(s) for the part(s)  not suspended. If suspension concerns the payment of the balance, — once 
                           suspension is lifted — the payment or the recovery of the amount(s) concerned will be considered the 
                             payment of the balance that closes the action. 
                           48.2               Procedure 
                           Before suspending payments, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary 
                           concerned:  
                                     -        informing it of its intention to suspend payments and the reasons why and  
                                     -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification. 
                            If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
                             observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
                           formally notify that the suspension procedure is not continued.  
                           The suspension will take effect the day the confirmation notification is sent by the [Commission][Agency].  
                           If the conditions for resuming payments are met, the suspension will be lifted. The [Commission][Agency] 
                             will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned. 
                          
                           During the suspension, the periodic report(s) for all reporting periods except the last one (see Article 20.3) 
                             must not contain any individual financial statements from the beneficiary concerned [and its linked third 
                           parties]. The coordinator must include them in the next periodic report after the suspension is lifted or — if 
                             suspension is not lifted before the end of the action — in the last periodic report. 
                           The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action (see Article 49.1) or terminate the Agreement 
                           or the participation of the beneficiary concerned (see Article 50.1 and 50.2).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            1. Suspension of payments (EU) 
            The Commission/Agency may suspend pre-financing, interim payments or the final payment (for 
            one or more or for all beneficiaries), on the grounds listed in this Article. 
             
                      Suspension of payments has NO impact on the action implementation. The consortium must continue 
                  to  work  on  the  action,  while  addressing  the  issues  that  have  led  to  suspension  of  the  payment;  costs 
                  incurred during suspension of payments are in principle eligible. 
                   
                Grounds for suspension of payments (EU): 
                   
                      . Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
                        grant) 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  suspend  payments,  if  a  beneficiary  has  committed  or  is 
                        suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                        obligations — either during the award procedure or under the GA. 
                            Example: false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding 
                       Substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  OR  serious  breach  of  obligations  (in 
                        other grants) 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  also  suspend  payments,  if  such  substantial  errors, 
                        irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants, if  
                               the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and 
                               the substantial errors, irregularities or  fraud or serious breach of obligations are:  
                                       systemic or recurrent and  
                                       have a material impact on this grant. 
                            Example: During an audit of other grants, the Commission detected systemic irregularities in the 
                            calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other GAs signed by the audited beneficiary. The 
                            Commission may suspend all outstanding payments for the audited beneficiary until the issue is 
                            resolved. 
            Suspension starts on the day the notification (confirming suspension) is sent to the coordinator 
            (and ends on the day it is lifted).  
            If necessary, the consortium may also decide to: 
                  suspend the GA (see Article 49)  
                  terminate the GA or the participation of the beneficiary concerned (see Article 50). 
             
            2. Procedure 
            Before suspending payments, the Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure. 
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it. 
            Depending on the situation and type of suspension, this procedure will be directed either at the 
            coordinator or the beneficiary concerned: 
                       suspension linked to the consortium: normally the coordinator 
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 48                                                            322 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                       suspension  linked  to  a  beneficiary  (e.g.  simultaneous  suspension  of  payments  in 
                        several grants after a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned. 
            If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must make sure that the other members of the 
            consortium are informed and ask for their comments. 
            If it is directed at the beneficiary, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator later on (in a 
            way that preserves confidentiality).  
                         
                       Information obligation — Beneficiaries do not have to inform their coordinators or ask them to 
                         
                  submit comments. However, they should inform them if there is the risk of a significant impact on the 
                  action (see Article 17.2). 
                         
                   
                       
            3. Effects 
                   
            During suspension, NO individual financial statements may be submitted for the beneficiary 
                   
            (or beneficiaries) concerned with the periodic reports (except with the report for the last reporting 
            period). 
                   
            Costs incurred (for continuing to implement the action during suspension) are eligible and may be 
                   
            included in the next financial report, after suspension has been lifted. They must be included in 
            the periodic report for the last reporting period (— even if suspension is still ongoing). 
                   
            Technical  reports  submitted  during  suspension  must  include  the  work  of  the  beneficiaries 
            concerned.  
                    Example: 
                1 May:      the  Commission  informs  the  coordinator  of  its  intention  to  suspend  interim  payments  for 
                            beneficiary B because an audit for other H2020 grants has detected systematic substantial errors in 
                            the calculation of its personnel costs.  
                15 May:     the coordinator comments that beneficiary B was not aware of its obligations in this respect. 
                1 June:     the Commission rejects the comments and confirms the suspension of payments for beneficiary B. 
                1 July:     the  coordinator  submits  all  reports  except  the  individual  financial  statement  for  beneficiary  B 
                            (covering an amount of EUR 75 000). 
                10 August:   the Commission pays for all beneficiaries except B. 
                25 October: the Commission approves remedial measures taken by beneficiary B (correcting the substantial 
                            errors  and  submitting  revised  financial  statements)  and  lifts  the  suspension.  The  costs  of 
                            beneficiary B will be submitted in the next reporting period. 
            If payments for one (or some) of the beneficiaries are still suspended at the end of the action, the 
            Commission/Agency  will  make  a  partial  payment  of  the  balance  for  the  amount  that  is  not 
            suspended  (—  but  ONLY  after  having  received  all  the  necessary  information  for  the  final 
            calculations for ALL consortium members, i.e. including the suspended beneficiaries). 
             
                    The partial final payment is NOT the payment that closes the action. That payment will be made only 
                after the payment suspensions are lifted.

                           ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION 
                           49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries 
                           49.1.1 Conditions 
                           The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
                           — in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult. 
                           49.1.2 Procedure 
                           The coordinator must immediately formally notify to the [Commission][Agency] the suspension (see Article 
                            52), stating: 
                                     -        the reasons why and 
                                     -        the expected date of resumption. 
                           The suspension will take effect the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                           Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately formally notify 
                           the [Commission][Agency] and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which the action 
                            will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to 
                           the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has been 
                            terminated (see Article 50). 
                           The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. 
                           This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                           Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6). 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. GA suspension (consortium) 
                         The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the ground set out in this Article. 
                          
                                              GA suspension may be used exceptionally if it is necessary to stop the action implementation, to fix 
                                       specific  problems.  It  should  NOT  be  used  in  situations  that  cannot  be  resolved  through  a  temporary 
                                       interruption; in these cases, it may be better to terminate the GA (see Article 50). 
                                        
                                  Ground for GA suspension (consortium): 
                                        
                                             .  Action can no longer be implemented (or becomes excessively difficult) 
                                                  The beneficiaries may suspend the action (in full or in part), if implementation becomes 
                                                   impossible or excessively difficult. 
                                                            Example: A fire devastates a beneficiary’s laboratory, with most of the technical equipment and 
                                                            computers used for the action and containing the research results. The beneficiaries therefore 
                                                            request that the part of the action that is affected by this is suspended until the laboratory is 
                                                            restored. 
                                        
                         Suspension starts on the day the Commission/Agency receives the notification (and ends on the 
                                        
                         resumption date specified in the amendment after resumption).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
             
             
                 Information obligation — Depending on the reasons for suspension, the beneficiaries may also have to 
             take other measures under the GA (e.g. inform the Commission/Agency under Article 17.2; notify a situation 
              of force majeure under Article 51). 
              
             
                  
            2. Procedure 
              
            The coordinator must immediately formally notify the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & 
              
            Tenders Portal). 
              
             
              
            3. Effects 
              
            The beneficiaries must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit the damage and do their 
            best to resume (i.e. continue) implementing the action as soon as possible. 
            During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are NOT 
            eligible (see Article 6.5). Costs may again be incurred for the action, once action implementation 
            is resumed. 
            If  the  action  can  be  continued  (resumed),  the  coordinator  must  notify  it  to  the 
            Commission/Agency by requesting an amendment to the GA.  
                The amendment must be requested in accordance with Article 55 (e.g. it must be signed by 
                the coordinator’s LSIGN).  
                It sets the resumption date and adapts the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the 
                action duration, modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods). 
                If  the  Commission/Agency  approves  the  amendment,  the  suspension  is  lifted  and  will  be 
                resumed as from the resumption date set out in the amendment. The resumption date can 
                be retroactive (i.e. back to the date when the problem stopped/issue was clarified). 
                    Example:  The  action  was  suspended  on  24.03.2016  due  to  weather  conditions.  Once  the  conditions 
                    improve,  the  coordinator  requests  and  amendment  to  lift  the  suspension  (e.g.  after  60  days,  on 
                    22.05.2016).  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  Article  54  of  the  GA,  the  action  will  be  resumed  as  from 
                    23.05.2016. 
                If the suspension is lifted and the action continues, the action’s remaining budget can be used 
                for  action  implementation.  (Although  it  may  be  that  the  budget  must  be  lowered  in  the 
                amendment, to adapt the action to the new situation). 
                    Example:  After  the  suspension,  it  is  decided  that  not  all  the  tasks  described  in  Annex  1  will  be 
                    implemented. 
            If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued (or the Commission/Agency does not approve 
            the amendment; see Article 55), the GA (or the participation of one or more beneficiaries) may be 
            terminated. 
                If  the  suspension  leads  to  GA  termination,  NO  further  costs  (incurred  after  the  date  of 
                suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1). 
                     Example:  The  action  starts  on  1.1.2015  and  is  to  last  36  months.  The  action’s  implementation  is 
                     suspended for four months, from the date after the Commission is notified, 1.12.2015 to 31.3.2016 and 
                     the suspension leads to the GA termination. The eligible costs are: 
                           costs incurred from the action’s start (1.1.2015) until the date of notification (30.11.2015) 
                           costs incurred for the submission of the first periodic report and the final report.

                           49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency] 
                           49.2.1 Conditions 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it if: 
                                     (a)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) has 
                                              committed or is suspected of having committed: 
                                                  (i)           substantial errors, irregularities, or fraud or  
                                                 (ii)           serious  breach  of  obligations    under  the  Agreement  or  during  the  award  procedure 
                                                                (including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
                                                                to provide required information, breach of ethical principles); 
                                     (b)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) has 
                                              committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — systemic or 
                                              recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a material impact on 
                                              this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 22.5.2), or 
                                     (c)  the action is suspected of having lost its scientific or technological relevance. 
                           49.2.2 Procedure 
                           Before  suspending  implementation  of  the  action,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  the 
                            coordinator or beneficiary concerned: 
                                     -        informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and 
                                     -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification. 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
                           observations  it  has  received,  it  will  formally  notify  confirmation  of  the  suspension.  Otherwise,  it  will 
                           formally notify that the procedure is not continued. 
                           The suspension will take effect five days after confirmation notification is received (or on a later date 
                            specified in the notification). 
                           It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met. 
                           The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be 
                           amended to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make 
                            other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the 
                           Agreement has already been terminated (see Article 50). 
                           The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. 
                           This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                           Costs incurred during suspension are not eligible (see Article 6). 
                           The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 46). 
                           Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to terminate the 
                           Agreement or participation of a beneficiary (see Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly paid 
                           (see Articles 43 and 44).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                     
            1. GA suspension (EU) 
            The Commission/Agency may suspend the action (in full or in part), on the grounds listed in this 
            Article. 
                Grounds for GA suspension (EU): 
                       Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
                        grant) 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  suspend  the  action,  if  a  beneficiary  has  committed  or  is 
                        suspected of having committed substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                        obligations — either during the award procedure or under the GA 
                            Example: false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding  
                       Substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  OR  serious  breach  of  obligations  (in 
                        other grants) 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  also  suspend  the  action,  if  such  substantial  errors, 
                        irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations were found in other grants, if  
                               the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and 
                               the substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations are:  
                                       systemic or recurrent and  
                                       have a material impact on this grant. 
                            Example: During an audit of other grants, the Commission detected systematic irregularities in the 
                            calculation of personnel costs that also affect all other GAs signed by the audited beneficiary. The 
                            Commission may suspend the audited beneficiary’s part of the action until the issue is resolved.  
                       Loss of scientific or technological relevance  
                        The Commission/Agency may suspend the action, if it needs time to assess whether the 
                        action has lost scientific or technological relevance. 
                        This may in particular be the case: 
                               if a complete revision of Annex 1 is necessary to assess the impact of a request for 
                                amendment 
                               if work has significantly deviated from the original work plan 
                               if  a  key  beneficiary  leaves  the  action  and  the  consortium  needs  time  to  find  a 
                                replacement 
                               after a check, audit or review of the action. 
                    Example: There are technical problems with implementing the work under an action as described in Annex 
                    1, so the consortium proposes changes to the work to be carried out. This may jeopardise its technological 
                    relevance and the Commission decides to suspend its implementation and to carry out a review. 
            Suspension starts 5 days after it is notified to the coordinator (or on a later date specified in the 
            notification)  and  ends  on  the  resumption  date  specified  in  the  amendment  signed  by  the 
            Commission/Agency). 
             
            2. Procedure 
            Before suspending the GA, the Commission/Agency will follow a contradictory procedure. 
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49.2                                                          327 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it. 
            Depending on the situation and type of suspension, this procedure will be directed either at the 
            coordinator or the beneficiary concerned: 
                       suspension linked to the consortium: normally the coordinator 
                       suspension linked to a beneficiary (e.g. simultaneous suspension of several grants after 
                        a beneficiary audit): normally the beneficiary concerned. 
            If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must make sure that the other members of the 
            consortium are informed and ask for their comments. 
            If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the Commission/Agency will inform the coordinator 
            later on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).  
                 
                       Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators  or ask 
                   them to submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact 
                   on the action (see Article 17.2). 
                 
                    
                    
            If  possible, the Commission/Agency will give an estimation of how long the suspension will be 
            needed.   
                    
                    
            3. Effects 
                    
            During suspension, costs incurred (for implementing the suspended part of the action) are NOT 
            eligible (see Article 6.5). Costs may again be declared for the action, once the action is resumed. 
                    
            If  the action can be continued, the Commission/Agency will lift the suspension and formally 
                    
            notify the coordinator (together with the suspension end date). 
                The  suspension  can  be  lifted  retroactively  (i.e.  back  to  the  date  when  the  problem 
                stopped/issue was clarified). 
                The coordinator must then request an  amendment to the GA (see Article 55), to set the 
                resumption date in the tools and adapt the grant to the new situation (e.g. by extending the 
                action duration modifying Annexes 1 and 2, updating the reporting periods). 
            If the action (or part of it) can NOT be continued, the GA (or the beneficiary concerned) may 
            be terminated. 
                If the suspension leads to the GA termination, NO further costs (incurred after the date of 
                suspension) can be declared, except the costs for the reports (see Article 6.1). 
                        Example: 
                        A key beneficiary is suspected of having declared as eligible personnel costs under the GA the costs of 
                        personnel employed by another company. The Commission suspends the implementation of the action 
                        in order to carry out checks. During that period of suspension, the beneficiary withdraws from the 
                        action.  The  consortium  cannot  find  a  replacement  for  this  beneficiary  and  terminates  the  GA  in 
                        accordance with Article 50.1. 
                        The GA starts on 1.5.2015 and lasts 42 months. 
                        The Commission suspends its implementation. 
                        The coordinator confirms having received notification of the suspension on 18.3.2017. 
                        The suspension takes effect on 23.3.2017. 
                        On 23.6.2017, the consortium formally notifies the GA termination.

                           50.1.1 Conditions and procedure 
                           The beneficiaries may terminate the Agreement. 
                           The coordinator must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52), stating: 
                                      -        the reasons why and 
                                      -        the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
                           If no reasons are given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers the reasons do not justify termination, the 
                           Agreement will be considered to have been ‘terminated improperly’ 
                           The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification. 
                           50.1.2 Effects 
                           The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                                      (i)  a periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) and 
                                      (ii)  the final report (see Article 20.4). 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the reports within the deadline (see above), only costs which 
                             are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
                           Article 21.4) on the basis of the reports submitted. Only costs incurred until termination are eligible (see 
                             Article 6). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination are not eligible. 
                           Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43). 
                           After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
                           36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
                            
                              
                                            
                         1. GA termination (consortium) 
                         The beneficiaries have the right to terminate the GA.  
                                     GA termination should be a last-resort measure, if all efforts to continue the action fail. 
                                   
                              If action implementation just becomes temporarily impossible or excessively difficult, it may be better not to 
                              terminate the GA, but to suspend it (see Article 49). In this case, the GA would only be terminated if it turns 
                                   
                              out later that implementation cannot be resumed anymore. 
                                       Example: A fire devastates a laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers used in the 
                                       action are stored. If the beneficiaries consider that the laboratory can be replaced and the action will still be 
                                       correctly implemented, they may suspend implementation and resume it when the new laboratory is operational. 
                                       However, if the action has been suspended and it is not possible to find a new laboratory and therefore it is 
                                       impossible to resume the action, the beneficiaries may terminate the GA.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                Grounds for GA termination (consortium): 
                       Any ground that justifies early termination of the action 
                        The beneficiaries may terminate the GA in principle on any ground — as long as there is a 
                        good  reason  (e.g.  circumstances  make  its  implementation  impossible  or  excessively 
                        difficult; loss of the action’s scientific or technological relevance; force majeure). 
                                Examples:  
                                1. The consortium decides to terminate the GA due to technical difficulties that result in the 
                                action no longer being viable.  
                                2. The consortium requests termination because the action was finished ahead of schedule. 
                        If there are no legitimate reasons for discontinuing the action, the Commission/Agency can 
                        NOT oppose, but termination will be considered improper. 
                 
                                  Improper termination of the GA may lead to a grant reduction (see (see Articles 5.3 and 
                              43).  
                               
                            This will be the case, for instance, if: 
                                       the  implementation  of  the  action  has  become  impossible  or  excessively 
                                  .     difficult due to the beneficiaries’ wilful misconduct or gross negligence 
                                       the reasons provided are based on changes in the strategic choices of the 
                                        beneficiaries, not linked to any specific economic or operational difficulties  
                               
                                       implementation  would  have  been  possible  if  the  beneficiaries  had  made 
                                        more (but still reasonable) efforts.  
                                    Example: The beneficiaries decide to terminate the GA due to internal communication 
                                    and decision-making problems within the consortium, and notify the Commission via the 
                                    coordinator. The Commission considers that these internal problems have jeopardised the 
                                    action’s implementation, but do not justify terminating the GA because they could have 
                                    been  solved  within  the  consortium  on  the  basis  of  the  consortium  agreement.  This 
                                    improper termination may lead to a grant reduction. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The coordinator must formally notify the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal) 
            of the termination — on behalf of the other beneficiaries. 
                Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the Commission/Agency beforehand, to discuss the 
                termination. 
            The notification must specify the date on which termination will take effect (termination date). 
            This date must be a date after the notification: Terminations cannot be retroactive (notably to 
            be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination; see point 3). 
             
            3. Effects 
            The coordinator must — within 60 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a periodic report 
            for the open reporting period until termination and the final report). 
            The  Commission/Agency  will  calculate  the  final  grant  amount  and  the  payment  of  the 
            balance (see Articles 5.3 and 21.4).  
            If  the total amount of earlier payments (pre-financing payment and interim payments, if any) 
            received before termination:

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                      is greater than the final grant amount, the balance is negative and will take the form of 
                       a recovery (see Article 21.4 and 44.1.2). 
                      is lower than the final grant amount, the Commission/Agency will pay the balance (see 
                       Article 21.4). 
            Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date; see 
            Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:  
                      costs for the reports (see Article 6.1) 
                            Example:  The  action’s  duration  is  36  months.  The  starting  date  is  1.1.2016.  The  notified 
                           termination date is 1.5.2017. Therefore, only costs incurred in connection with the action from 
                           1.1.2016 to 1.5.2017 (16 months) and the costs related to submission of the periodic report for the 
                           last reporting period and the final report are eligible 
                      costs  for  (the  part  of)  contracts  or  subcontracts  delivered  before  termination  (see 
                       Article 6.1). 
                            Example: One of the beneficiaries of the GA has a contract to carry out 8 tests during the action’s 
                           duration. However, only three tests out of 8 are carried out before the GA is terminated. Therefore, 
                           only the costs related to these 3 tests carried out before termination may be eligible for the action. 
            If the coordinator fails to submit the reports (within the 60 days of the date on which termination 
            takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report will NOT be taken 
            into account when the final grant amount is calculated. The Commission/Agency will NOT send a 
            reminder and will NOT extend the deadline.  
            The detailed calculations are described in Article 21. 
            Termination has NO effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of 
            the action.  
                Obligations that continue to apply after the GA is terminated: 
                       Keeping records and other supporting documentation (Article 18.1) 
                       Submitting the periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination) and the final 
                        report (see Article 50.1.1 and 20) 
                       Providing requested information and allow access to their sites and premises (for checks, 
                        reviews, audits, investigations or evaluations of the action’s impact; see Articles 22 and 23) 
                       Complying with the rules on management of intellectual property, background and results 
                        (see Section 3 of Chapter 4 of the GA)  
                       Maintaining confidentiality (see Article 36) 
                       Complying with the security obligations (if applicable) (see Article 37) 
                       Promoting the action and giving visibility to the EU funding (see Article 38) 
                       No assignment of claims for payment (see Article 40) 
                       Chapter 6 measures (i.e. rejection of costs (see Article 42), grant reduction (see Article 43), 
                        recovery (see Article 44).

                           50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries 
                           50.2.1 Conditions and procedure 
                           The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
                           beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries. 
                           The coordinator must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52) and inform 
                             the beneficiary concerned. 
                           If the coordinator’s participation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
                           by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries). 
                           The notification must include: 
                                     -        the reasons why; 
                                     -        the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing); 
                                     -        the date the termination takes effect. This date must be after the notification, and 
                                     -        a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and the 
                                              estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned (see Annexes 1 and 2) and, if necessary, the addition 
                                              of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination takes effect after the period set out 
                                              in Article 3, no request for amendment must be included unless the beneficiary concerned is the 
                                              coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose a new coordinator. 
                           If this information is not given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers that the reasons do not justify 
                           termination, the participation will be considered to have been terminated improperly. 
                           The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification. 
                           50.2.2 Effects 
                           The coordinator must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                                     (i)  a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and 
                                     (ii)  if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘termination report’ from the 
                                              beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an overview of 
                                              the progress of the work, an overview of the use of resources, the individual financial statement 
                                              and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement (see Article 20.3 and 20.4). 
                             The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting 
                             period (see Article 20.3). 
                             If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question the 
                             decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
                             be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                             If  the  request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended to 
                             introduce the necessary changes (see Article 55). 
                             The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the report 
                             on the distribution of payments —  calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the (pre-
                             financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amount.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                 The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps: 
                     Step 1 —    Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                                 The  grant  amount  for  the  beneficiary  is  calculated  by  applying  the  reimbursement 
                                 rate(s) to the total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary [and its linked third parties] 
                                 in the termination report and approved by the [Commission][Agency].  
                                 Only  costs  incurred  by  the  beneficiary  concerned  until  termination  takes  effect  are 
                                 eligible  (see  Article  6).  Costs  relating  to  contracts  due  for  execution  only  after 
                                 termination are not eligible.  
             
                      Step 2 —   Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                                 obligations 
                                 In case of a reduction (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency] will calculate the 
                                 reduced grant amount for the beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction 
                                 (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach 
                                 of  obligations,  in  accordance  with  Article  43.2)  from  the  grant  amount  for  the 
                                 beneficiary. 
              If the payments received exceed the amounts due: 
                     -   if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3 and the request for amendment is 
                         accepted, the beneficiary concerned must repay to the coordinator the amount unduly received. 
                         The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the amount unduly received and request the 
                         beneficiary concerned to repay it to the coordinator within 30 days of receiving notification. If it 
                         does not repay the coordinator, the [Commission][Agency] will draw upon the Guarantee Fund 
                         to pay the coordinator and then notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the 
                         beneficiary concerned (see Article 44); 
                     -   in all other cases (in particular if termination takes effect after the period set out in Article 3), the 
                         [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  a  debit  note  to  the  beneficiary  concerned.  If 
                         payment  is  not  made  by  the  date  in  the  debit  note,  the  Guarantee  Fund  will  pay  to  the 
                         [Commission][Agency] the amount due and the [Commission][Agency] will notify a debit note 
                         on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the beneficiary concerned (see Article 44); 
                     -   if the beneficiary concerned is the former coordinator, it must repay the new coordinator the 
                         amount unduly received, unless: 
                             -   termination takes effect after an interim payment and 
                             -   the former coordinator has not distributed amounts received as pre-financing or interim 
                                 payments (see Article 21.7). 
                         In  this  case,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  a  debit  note  to  the  former 
                         coordinator. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will pay to 
                         the [Commission][Agency] the amount due. The [Commission][Agency] will then pay the new 
                         coordinator and notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the former coordinator 
                         (see Article 44). 
             
              If the payments received do not exceed the amounts due: amounts owed to the beneficiary concerned will 
             be included in the next interim or final payment. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the termination report within the deadline (see above), only 
              costs included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
             If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline 
             (see above), it will consider that:

                 -   the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned and that 
                 -   the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator. 
              Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43) or termination of the Agreement 
              (see Article 50). 
              After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
             Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

              50.2   Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
             
             Not applicable 
             
             
                     
            1. Beneficiary termination (consortium) 
            The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of a beneficiary (or of several beneficiaries), if: 
                -   the beneficiary concerned requests it or 
                -   the  consortium  decides  to  terminate  the  beneficiary’s  participation  (using  its  internal 
                    decision-making procedures). In this case, the consortium must inform the beneficiary 
                    concerned,  request  the  beneficiary’s  opinion  in  writing  and  provide  it  to  the 
                    Commission/Agency  (or  —  if  the  beneficiary  didn’t  reply  —  provide  proof  that  the 
                    beneficiary’s opinion has been requested in writing).  
                Grounds for beneficiary termination (consortium): 
                       Any ground that justifies termination of the participation of the beneficiary 
                        The beneficiaries may terminate the participation of one of their consortium members in 
                        principle  on  any  ground  —  as  long  as  there  is  a  good  reason  (e.g.  withdrawal  by  a 
                        beneficiary because due to a change in ownership; the beneficiary cannot implement its 
                        tasks in the same way; bankruptcy). 
                         
                                    For beneficiaries that are involved in several EU GAs, withdrawal from one GA does 
                                NOT necessarily imply that it has to also withdraw from the others. 
                                    Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the 
                                coordinator  must  immediately  inform  the  Commission/Agency.  Late  information  will  be 
                                considered as a breach of the information obligation under the GA (see Article 17.2). 
                             
                                 
                        If there are no legitimate reasons, the Commission/Agency can NOT oppose beneficiary 
                                 
                        termination, but it will be considered improper.

                                  Improper termination of the participation of a beneficiary may lead to GA termination 
                              (see Article 50.3.1(c)) and/or to a grant reduction at the payment of the balance (see Articles 
                                 
                              5.3 and 43).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            Termination extends to linked third parties. Terminating a beneficiary’s participation implies that 
            its linked third parties’ may NOT continue participating in the action. 
             
                     Linked third parties — Linked third parties are allowed to fully participate in actions, like beneficiaries.   
                  Linked third parties can NOT however do more than the beneficiary they are linked to: If their beneficiary is 
                  terminated, they must also leave the action. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The coordinator must formally notify the Commission/Agency of the termination (via the Funding 
            &  Tenders  Portal).  At  the  same  time,  the  coordinator  must  inform  the  beneficiary  concerned 
            (through the usual communication channels — in writing and offline). 
            The notification must include all the information set out in this Article (including the date the 
            termination takes effect) and a request for an amendment. 
            Since for beneficiary termination the notification is combined with an amendment request, they 
            must  be  submitted  and  signed  by  the  PLSIGN  of  the  coordinator  (on  behalf  of  the  other 
            beneficiaries; see Annex 3). 
            NO amendment is needed if the termination takes effect after the end of the action — unless it 
            concerns the coordinator (since the coordinator has many obligations also after the end of the 
            action, e.g. submit the reports, receive the payment of the balance and distribute the payment 
            among the beneficiaries).  
            The amendment must be requested in accordance with Article 55.  
            If  it  is  accepted,  the  GA  will  be  amended  to  introduce  the  necessary  changes  (including,  if 
            necessary, the addition of new beneficiaries). 
            If it is rejected, the beneficiaries will have to make another proposal to the Commission/Agency. If 
            a satisfactory solution cannot be found (i.e. the request for an amendment calls into question the 
            decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of the equal treatment of applicants), the GA 
            may be terminated. 
                    Example:  A  key  beneficiary  terminates  its  participation  in  the  GA.  The  consortium  cannot  find  a 
                    replacement and cannot continue implementing the action without one. 
            The notification must specify the date on which termination will take effect (termination date). 
            This date must be a date after the notification: Terminations cannot be retroactive (notably to 
            be able to comply with the obligations and deadlines after termination; see point 3). 
             
            3. Effects 
            If the GA continues (i.e. it is amended), the remaining members of the consortium (and any new 
            beneficiaries) have the responsibility for fully implementing the action as described in Annex 1 
            (see  Article  41.1).  They  must  carry  out  the  action  (including  the  part  that  the  defaulting 
            beneficiary was supposed to carry out and without any additional funding to do so) — unless the 
            Commission/Agency expressly agrees otherwise.  
            The coordinator must — within 30 days — submit the necessary reports (i.e. a report on the 
            distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and a termination report).  
            In case of coordinator termination, the reports must be submitted by the new coordinator (to 
            avoid problems with the payment). If the nomination of the new coordinator takes more time, the 
            30 days deadline may be extended. 
            The information contained in the beneficiary’s termination report must also be included in the 
            periodic report for the next reporting period.  
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.2                                                          336 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
            The Commission/Agency will calculate the amount due to the terminated beneficiary:  
                       if  the  Commission/Agency owes amounts to the beneficiary, those amounts will be 
                        paid with the following payment to the consortium (interim or final) 
                       if the beneficiary owes, those amounts must be paid back to the consortium. 
            Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date see 
            Article 6.1(a)) are eligible — except for the:  
                      costs for the termination report (see Article 6.1) 
                      costs  for  (the  part  of)  contracts  or  subcontracts  delivered  before  termination  (see 
                       Article 6.1). 
            If the coordinator fails to submit the termination report (within the 30 days of the date on which 
            termination takes effect), costs that are not included in an approved periodic financial report will 
            NOT be taken into account when the contribution is calculated. The Commission/Agency will NOT 
            send a written reminder and will not extend the deadline.  
            If  the  coordinator  fails  to  submit  the  report  on  the  distribution  of  payments,  the  terminated 
            beneficiary whose participation was terminated will NOT have to repay any amounts. 
            The detailed calculations are described in Article 21. 
            Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of 
            the action (see Article 50.1).  
             
            Specific cases (beneficiary termination): 
            Termination  of  the  coordinator  without  its  agreement  —  The  decision  to  terminate  the 
            coordinator must be made by the rest of the consortium (according to its internal decision-making 
            procedures). The notification and amendment request must be made by one of the beneficiaries (acting 
            on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 55) and the reports must be submitted by the new 
            coordinator (to avoid problems with the payment). If needed, the 30 days deadline for submission of 
            the reports can be extended (see above). 
            Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — In principle the coordinator 
            must be changed. If the coordinator can no longer submit the request, the same procedure as for 
            coordinator termination without its agreement should be used (see above and Article 55). 
            Exceptionally, at the end of the action it may not be necessary to change the coordinator, but only its 
            bank account if the administrator/liquidator accepts to do the final transfers of amounts.

                           50.3  Termination  of  the  Agreement  or  the  participation  of  one  or  more  beneficiaries,  by  the 
                                           [Commission][Agency] 
                           50.3.1 Conditions 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may terminate the Agreement or the participation of one or more beneficiaries, 
                           if: 
                                      (a)  one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 56); 
                                      (b)  a change to their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or those of its 
                                              linked third parties)] is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or 
                                              calls into question the decision to award the grant; 
                                      (c)  following termination of participation for one or  more beneficiaries (see above),  the necessary 
                                              changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the 
                                              principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 55); 
                                      (d)  implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
                                              coordinator (see Article 49.1) and either: 
                          
                                                  (i)           resumption is impossible, or 
                                                 (ii)           the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the 
                                                                grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;

                                              has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
                                              any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law; 
                                      (f)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) has 
                                              been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means; 
                                      (g)  a beneficiary does not comply with the applicable national law on taxes and social security; 
                                      (h)  the action has lost scientific or technological relevance;

                 (m) a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                     has  committed  —  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  to  it  under  similar  conditions  — 
                     systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                     material impact on this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant); see Article 
                     22.5.2; 
                 (n)  [OPTION 1: despite  a  specific  request  by  the  [Commission][Agency],  a  beneficiary  does  not 
                     request — through  the coordinator — an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of 
                     one of its linked third parties or international partners that is in one of the situations under points 
                     (e), (f), (g), (k), (l) or (m) and to reallocate its tasks][OPTION 2: not applicable]. 
              50.3.2 Procedure 
              Before terminating the Agreement or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the [Commission][Agency] 
             will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned: 
                 -   informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and 
                 -   inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and — in case of Point 
                     (l.ii) above — to inform the [Commission][Agency] of the measures to ensure compliance with the 
                     obligations under the Agreement. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
              observations  it  has  received,  it  will  formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  or  beneficiary  concerned 
             confirmation of the termination and the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the 
              procedure is not continued. 
              The termination will take effect: 
                 -   for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j), (l.ii) and (n) above: on the day specified in 
                     the notification of the confirmation (see above); 
                 -   for  terminations  under  Points  (a),  (d),  (f),  (i),  (k),  (l.i)  and  (m)  above:  on  the  day  after  the 
                     notification of the confirmation is received. 
              50.3.3 Effects 
               (b)  for termination of the Agreement: 
                   The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                     (i) a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) and 
                     (ii) a final report (see Article 20.4). 
                   If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see Articles 20.8 and 
                   50.3.1(l)), the coordinator may not submit any reports after termination. 
                   If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the reports within the deadline (see above), only costs 
                   which are included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
                   The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
                   (see Article 21.4) on the basis of the reports submitted. Only costs incurred until termination takes 
                   effect are eligible (see Article 6). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination 
                   are not eligible. 
                   This does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to 
                   impose administrative sanctions (Article 45). 
                   The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency] (see 
                   Article 46).

                   After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
                   4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
               (c)  for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries: 
                   The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                       (i)   a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned; 
                       (ii)  a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
                             estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned (see Annexes 1 and 2) and, if necessary, the 
                             addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified after 
                             the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the 
                             beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case the request for amendment must 
                             propose a new coordinator, and 
                      (iii)  if  termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a termination report 
                             from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing 
                             an  overview  of  the  progress  of  the  work,  an  overview  of  the  use  of  resources,  the 
                             individual financial statement and, if applicable, the certificate on the financial statement 
                             (see Article 20). 
                   The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next 
                   reporting period (see Article 20.3). 
                   If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question 
                   the  decision  awarding  the  grant  or  breaches  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  of  applicants),  the 
                   Agreement may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                   If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended 
                   to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 55). 
                 The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
                 report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if 
                 the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amount. 
                     The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps: 
                         Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                                     The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by applying the reimbursement 
                                     rate(s) to the total eligible costs declared by the beneficiary [and its linked third 
                                     parties] in the termination report and approved by the [Commission][Agency].  
             
                                     Only costs incurred by the beneficiary concerned until termination takes effect are 
                                     eligible (see Article 6). Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after 
                                     termination are not eligible. 
                         Step  2  —  Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                                     obligations 
                                     In case of a reduction (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency] will calculate 
                                     the  reduced  grant  amount  for  the  beneficiary  by  deducting  the  amount  of  the 
                                     reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities 
                                     or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant 
                                     amount for the beneficiary. 
             
                   If the payments received exceed the amounts due:

                         -   if  termination  takes  effect  during  the  period  set  out  in  Article  3  and  the  request  for 
                             amendment  is  accepted,  the  beneficiary  concerned  must  repay  to  the  coordinator  the 
                             amount  unduly  received.  The  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  the  amount 
                             unduly received and request the beneficiary concerned to repay it to the coordinator within 
                             30  days  of  receiving  notification.  If  it  does  not  repay  the  coordinator,  the 
                             [Commission][Agency] will draw upon the Guarantee Fund to pay the coordinator and then 
                             notify  a  debit  note  on  behalf  of  the  Guarantee  Fund  to  the  beneficiary  concerned  (see 
                             Article 44); 
                         -   in all other cases, in particular if termination takes effect after the period set out in Article 
                             3,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  a  debit  note  to  the  beneficiary 
                             concerned. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will 
                             pay to the [Commission][Agency] the amount due and the [Commission][Agency] will 
                             notify  a  debit  note  on  behalf  of  the  Guarantee  Fund  to  the  beneficiary  concerned  (see 
                             Article 44); 
                         -   if the beneficiary concerned is the former coordinator, it must repay the new coordinator 
                             the amount unduly received, unless: 
                                 -   termination takes effect after an interim payment and 
                                 -   the former coordinator has not distributed amounts received as pre-financing or 
                                     interim payments (see Article 21.7) 
                             In this case, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a debit note to the former 
                             coordinator. If payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the Guarantee Fund will 
                             pay to the [Commission][Agency] the amount due. The [Commission][Agency] will then 
                             pay the new coordinator and notify a debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund to the 
                             former coordinator (see Article 44). 
             
                    If  the  payments  received  do  not  exceed  the  amounts  due:  amounts  owed  to  the  beneficiary 
                     concerned will be included in the next interim or final payment. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the termination report within the deadline (see above), only 
              costs included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report on the distribution of payments within the deadline 
             (see above), it will consider that: 
                 -   the coordinator did not distribute any payment to the beneficiary concerned, and that 
                 -   the beneficiary concerned must not repay any amount to the coordinator. 
              After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
              Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

              EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                       General MGA 
              1. GA or beneficiary termination (EU) 
              The  Commission/Agency  may  terminate  the  GA  or  the  participation  of  one  (or  more)  of  the 
              beneficiaries, on the grounds listed in this Article. 
                   
                         Beneficiary termination may lead to GA termination, if the Commission/Agency considers that the GA 
                     can NOT be continued (see Article 50.3.1(c)). 
                   
                         The GA may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination would call into question the the decision 
                     awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                     
                  Grounds for termination (EU): 
                         . 
                          Non-accession to the GA  
                            The  Commission/Agency  may  terminate  the  GA,  if  one  (or  more)  beneficiaries  did  not 
                            accede to the GA (i.e. did not sign the Accession Form within 30 days after the entry into 
                            force of the GA or did not provide the requested declaration on joint and several liability). 
                            Non-accession of a beneficiary does NOT automatically lead to the GA termination; the 
                            consortium can find an alternative solution that ensures the proper implementation of the 
                            action without the beneficiary (and request an amendment; see Article 55).  
                                 In  this  case,  the  Commission/Agency  will  terminate  the  GA  only  if  it  considers  the 
                                 solution  inappropriate  or  if  the  consortium  no  longer  complies  with  the  eligibility 
                                 conditions set out General Annexes A and C to the H2020 Work Programme (e.g. the 
                                 rules regarding the minimum number of beneficiaries, their legal situation, or their place 
                                                        70
                                 of establishment).       
                                      Examples: 
                                      1.  Three  entities  from  Poland,  Portugal  and France,  are going  to  participate  in  a  GA.  The 
                                      French beneficiary does not accede to the GA, and the other two beneficiaries fail to find a 
                                      solution to this. The Commission terminates the GA because the conditions set out in the work 
                                      programme/call are not met (i.e. the rule that three legal entities must take part). 
                                      2. A key beneficiary does not take part in the action after all; the assessment of the action 
                                      based on the award criteria announced in the call for proposals would have had a different 
                                      result. 
                           Change in a beneficiary’s situation  
                            The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if there has been 
                            a change to its (or one of its linked third parties’) legal, financial, technical, organisational 
                            or  ownership  situation,  that  is  likely  to  substantially  affect  or  delay  the  action’s 
                            implementation or calls into question the decision to award the grant.  
                            Such changes can be of any kind and can be triggered by the beneficiary itself or outside 
                            circumstances. 
                                 Examples:  
                                 1. An action’s key beneficiary is taken over by a non-European company (not entitled to participate 
                                 due to security reasons). This substantially affects the action’s implementation and the ownership, 
                                 protection, exploitation and dissemination of the results. The Commission decides to terminate the 
                                 beneficiary’s participation in the GA (or the GA if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to 
                                 replace it). 
                                 2. The country in which one of the beneficiaries is established ceases to be an EU Member State. 
                                 This means that the beneficiary is no longer eligible for funding and that the decision to award the 
                                 grant  is  called  into  question.  The  Commission  may  decide  to  terminate  the  beneficiary’s 
                                 participation in the GA (or the GA if the other beneficiaries fail to find a solution to replace it). 
                                  
                                         Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article 6). 
                                          
                                     
                           GA cannot be amended after termination of a beneficiary’s participation

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if it cannot be amended after termination 
                        of a beneficiary’s participation because the necessary changes to the GA would call into 
                        question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of the equal treatment of 
                        applicants; see Article 55). 
                        The GA may be directly terminated if beneficiary termination would call into question the 
                        the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                       Action can no longer be implemented  
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA, if action implementation is prevented by 
                        force majeure or the action implementation is suspended and resumption is not possible or 
                        the necessary amendment is not acceptable (see Articles 49 and 55).  
                            Example:  
                            1. A fire devastates a laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers with the 
                            action’s research data are stored. The coordinator suspends the action’s implementation to rebuild 
                            the  laboratory.  The  Commission  carries  out  a  review  after  the  force  majeure  takes  place  and 
                            concludes  that  the  consortium  can  no  longer  implement  the  action.  It  therefore  decides  to 
                            terminate the GA. 
                            2.  A  beneficiary  that  has  the  necessary  background  to  work  on  the  action  and  owns  the 
                            installations where most of the work would be implemented decides to terminate its participation. 
                            The Commission decides to terminate the GA because continuing implementing the action without 
                            this beneficiary calls into question the decision awarding the grant. 
                       Bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors, suspension 
                        of business activities or other similar proceedings  
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it is declared 
                        bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, has entered into 
                        an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to any other 
                        similar proceedings or procedures under national law (since this normally implies that the 
                        beneficiary cannot carry out the work properly).  
                            Example:  A  coordinator  informs  the  Commission  that  a  beneficiary  participating  in  a  GA  is 
                            insolvent. It does not notify beneficiary termination because it thinks that the beneficiary may 
                            continue implementing the action. The Commission considers that the beneficiary has not sufficient 
                            means to pursue implementation and terminates the beneficiary’s participation. 
                         
                                 Information obligation — In case of bankruptcy (or similar), the beneficiary or the 
                            coordinator  must  immediately  inform  the  Commission/Agency.  Late  information  will  be 
                            considered as a breach of the information obligation under the GA (see Article 17.2). 
                             
                       Professional misconduct 
                             
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or one of its 
                                 
                        representatives) has been found guilty of professional misconduct (proven by any means). 
                            Example:  A  legal  entity’s  participation  in  a  GA  is  terminated  when  a  national  investigation 
                             
                            uncovers that it falsified the results of its clinical studies. 
                             
                       Non-compliance with tax or social security obligations 
                             
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  terminate  the  participation  of  a  beneficiary,  if  it  has  not 
                        fulfilled its obligations to pay social security contributions or taxes under national law (i.e. 
                             
                        the law of the country in which it is established and those of the country where the action is 
                        implemented; see Article 7). 
                             
                            Example: A national administration notifies to the Commission/Agency that a beneficiary did not 
                            pay social security contribution for its employees. If this beneficiary cannot prove that it paid these 
                            contributions or clarify the situation within a given deadline, the Commission may terminate its 
                            participation in the GA. 
                       Loss of scientific or technological relevance 
                        The  Commission/Agency  may  terminate  the  GA,  if  the  action  has  lost  scientific  or 
                        technological relevance. 
                            Example: A proposal on research on a new system based on recently discovered material is 
                            selected. After the action starts, a European scientific publication demonstrates that this material 
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3                                                          343 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                            contains a chemical substance that irremediably harms human health. Therefore, the action cannot 
                            continue and the Commission decides to terminate the GA. 
                       Specific grounds for joint actions  
                        For joint actions (i.e. actions funded following a joint or coordinated call with a third country 
                        or international organisation (IO); see Article 2), the Commission/Agency may terminate 
                        the GA, if: 
                               the third country/IO action does not start by the date specified in Annex 1 
                                In  this  case,  NO  costs  incurred  by  the  consortium  will  be  accepted.  Any  pre-
                                financing provided to the consortium must be returned to the Commission/Agency 
                                in full. 
                               the third country/IO action is terminated 
                               the third country/IO action can no longer contribute to the subject of the GA. 
                                    Example: if the coordination agreement is not signed. 
                       Fraud, corruption or other criminal activities 
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary, if it (or one of its 
                        representatives) has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, 
                        money laundering or any other illegal activity. 
                            Example: A legal entity’s participation in several EU projects is terminated when its owner is 
                            convicted by national courts to have participated in large-scale drug trafficking. 
                       Substantial errors, irregularities or fraud OR serious breach of obligations (in this 
                        grant) 
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the GA or the participation of a beneficiary, if a 
                        beneficiary (or one of its representatives) has committed substantial errors, irregularities or 
                        fraud or serious breach of obligations — either during the award procedure or under the GA. 
                            Example: false declarations in the proposal form, in order to obtain EU funding; coordinator does 
                            not transfer payments to the other beneficiaries, but uses them for itself; coordinator does not 
                            submit  the  reports  (despite  a  reminder);  consortium  does  not  inform  the  Commission/Agency 
                            about the receipt of a second grant for the same/similar proposal; review shows that action does 
                            not achieve its critical objectives and is way behind schedule and consortium submits a short-term 
                            implementation plan that is not acceptable; audit shows that beneficiary declared costs based on 
                            fake invoices; consortium does not provide requested information (despite a reminder); a check 
                            shows that scientific reports submitted by the consortium were almost entirely copied from the web 
                            (plagiarism); consortium does not submit an amendment request after beneficiary termination. 
                       Substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  OR  serious  breach  of  obligations  (in 
                        other grants) 
                        The Commission/Agency may also terminate the GA or the participation of a beneficiary, if 
                        such substantial errors, irregularities- or, fraud or serious breach of obligations were found 
                        in other grants, if  
                               the other grants were awarded under similar conditions and 
                               the substantial errors, irregularities or  fraud or serious breach of obligations are:  
                                       systemic or recurrent and  
                                       have a material impact on this grant. 
                            Example: During an audit of other grants, the Commission detected systematic irregularities in the 
                            calculation of personnel costs that appear intentional and also affect all other GAs signed by the 
                            audited beneficiary. The Commission may terminate the participation of the audited beneficiary in 
                            the GA.  
                       Non-removal of a linked third party/international partner 
                         
                        The Commission/Agency may terminate the participation of a beneficiary if it refuses to 
                        remove one of its linked third parties or an international partner which is in one of the 
                        following situations:   
                         
                            -  bankruptcy, winding-up, administration, arrangement with creditors, suspension of 
                               business activities or other similar proceedings;

                            -  professional misconduct 
                            -  non-compliance with tax or social security obligations 
                            -  fraud, corruption or other criminal activities 
                            -  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  (in  this 
                               grant or other grants). 
                        This termination ground was introduced as explicit contractual ground with GA version 3.0. 
                        For older grant agreements, beneficiary termination/linked third party removal was however 
                        already implicitly included in the different grounds of Article 50.3.3 (given that linked third 
                        parties have to fulfil the same conditions as the beneficiaries for participating in the action). 
            Before terminating (GA or beneficiary), the Commission/Agency may first suspend the GA (see 
            Article 49.2), to try to fix the problems and re-establish compliance with the GA. In this case, it 
            will only terminate (the GA or a beneficiary) if the action cannot be resumed. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            Before  GA  or  beneficiary  termination,  the  Commission/Agency  will  follow  a  contradictory 
            procedure  
                Contradictory procedure: 
                Step 1 —   The Commission/Agency informs the coordinator/beneficiary concerned of its intention 
                           (and the reasons why), in a pre-information letter.  
                Step 2 —   The  coordinator/beneficiary  concerned  has  30  days  to  submit  observations.  An 
                           extension may be granted on justified request — if submitted within the 30 days. 
                Step 3 —   The Commission/Agency analyses the observations and either stops the procedure or 
                           confirms it. 
            Depending on the situation and type of termination, this procedure will be directed either at the 
            coordinator or the beneficiary concerned: 
                       terminations linked to the consortium (e.g. GA termination after a negative project 
                        review): normally the coordinator 
                       terminations  linked  to  a  beneficiary  (e.g.  beneficiary  termination  or  simultaneous 
                        termination of GAs after a beneficiary audit):  normally the beneficiary concerned. 
            If it is directed at the coordinator, the coordinator must inform the other beneficiaries offline, via 
            its usual communication channels (e.g. e-mail, registered letters with proof of delivery, etc.) and 
            ask for their comments.  
            If it is directed at the beneficiary concerned, the Commission/Agency will inform coordinator later 
            on (in a way that preserves confidentiality).  
                         
                        Information obligation — Beneficiaries normally do not have to inform their coordinators or ask 
                   them to submit comments. However, they should inform them, if there is the risk of a significant impact on 
                         
                   the action (see Article 17.2). 
                         
            If a beneficiary is terminated on the basis of Article 50.3.1(e) (i.e. bankruptcy or similar), the 
                        
            Commission/Agency will also contact the liquidator/administrator (— as soon as possible after the 
            termination is confirmed). 
                    
                    
            If it confirms termination, the Commission/Agency will specify the date on which termination will 
            take effect (termination date).  
                    
                This date will be a date after the notification: Terminations cannot be retroactive (notably to 
                    
                ensure the fulfilment of obligations and deadlines after termination; see point 3). 
                    
            H2020 > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50.3                                                          345

                For  some  cases,  the  Commission/Agency  may  choose  a  future  date  (in  order  to  give  the 
                beneficiaries the possibility to close the action). For the other cases (e.g. termination under 
                points (a), (d), (f), (i), (k), (l.i) and (m)), the termination will take effect immediately, i.e. on 
                the day after the coordinator receives the notification of the confirmation (see Article 50.3.2).  
             
            3. Effects  
            The effects of GA termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate the GA (see 
            Article 50.1.2). 
                Only costs incurred before termination (i.e. generating event before the termination date; see 
                Article 6.1(a)) are eligible. Costs relating to contracts due for execution only after termination 
                are not eligible. 
                Ineligible costs will be rejected. The grant may be reduced, if the termination is based on 
                substantial  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  (for  instance  if  the 
                action has not been implemented properly; see Articles 5.3 and 43). In certain cases, the 
                Commission/Agency  may  also  impose  administrative  sanctions  (i.e.  exclusion  and/or 
                financial penalties; see Article 45). 
            The effects of beneficiary termination are the same as when the beneficiaries terminate one of 
            their partners (see Article 50.2.2). 
            The detailed calculations are described in Article 21. 
            Termination has no effect on the provisions that normally continue to apply after the end of 
            the action (see Article 50.1). 
             
            Specific case: 
            Termination of the coordinator — The amendment request must be made by one of the beneficiaries 
            (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Article 55) and the reports must be submitted by the 
            new coordinator. If needed, the 60 days deadline for submission of the reports can be extended.

                           51.1               Force majeure 
                           ‘Force majeure’ means any situation or event that: 
                                              -        prevents either party from fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement, 
                                              -        was unforeseeable, exceptional situation and beyond the parties’ control, 
                                              -        was not due to error or negligence on their part (or on the part of third parties involved in the 
                                                       action), and 
                                              -        proves to be inevitable in spite of exercising all due diligence. 
                           The following cannot be invoked as force majeure: 
                                              -        any default of a service, defect in equipment or material or delays in making them available, 
                                                       unless they stem directly from a relevant case of force majeure, 
                                              -        labour disputes or strikes, or 
                                              -        financial difficulties. 
                           Any situation constituting force majeure must be formally notified to the other party without delay, stating 
                           the nature, likely duration and foreseeable effects. 
                           The parties must immediately take all the necessary steps to limit any damage due to force majeure and do 
                            their best to resume implementation of the action as soon as possible. 
                           The  party  prevented  by  force  majeure  from  fulfilling  its  obligations  under  the  Agreement  cannot  be 
                           considered in breach of them. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Force majeure  
                         What? In case of force majeure, a party will be excused from not fulfilling its obligations (i.e. 
                         there will be no breach of obligations under the GA and none of the adverse measures for breach 
                         of contract will be applied). 
                                  ‘Force majeure’ relates to an extraordinary event or situation that is beyond the party’s control 
                                  and that prevents it from fulfilling its obligations under the GA. 
                                            Examples (force majeure): An earthquake, terrorist attack or volcanic eruption; delay in delivering 
                                            equipment due to floods in the region/country. 
                                            Examples (not force majeure): machine malfunctions, robberies; a subcontractor building a test site 
                                            went bankrupt.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                The event or situation must be inevitable (despite the beneficiary’s due diligence, i.e. level of 
                care that can reasonably be expected from a beneficiary, in order to ensure the fulfilment of 
                its obligations under the GA) and unforeseeable. Force majeure can NOT be used to justify 
                situations caused by a beneficiary’s negligence or by events that could reasonably have been 
                anticipated. 
                The following cases are explicitly NOT considered force majeure: 
                       default of a service, defect in equipment or material or delays in making them available 
                        — unless they stem directly from a relevant case of force majeure 
                       labour disputes or strikes 
                       financial difficulties. 
                Personal reasons (e.g. sickness) or internal instructions  are in general  NOT  considered as 
                cases of force majeure. 
            If force majeure entails extra costs for the implementation of the action, it will normally be the 
            beneficiaries that must bear them (since they were not budgeted and the maximum grant amount 
            set out in Article 5.1 cannot be increased).  
               New in Horizon 2020: If a task could not be executed due to a situation of force majeure but 
            certain costs were incurred for that task and could not have been avoided, those costs may still be 
            eligible. This is different from FP7, where only costs for tasks that had actually been executed up 
            to the date of the force majeure were eligible. 
                Example: Airline  tickets  bought  for  a  beneficiary  to  attend  a  meeting  related  to  the  action.  The  flight  is 
                cancelled due to a volcano eruption, making it impossible for the beneficiary to travel to the meeting. If the 
                ticket  costs  fulfil  the  eligibility  conditions  set  out  under  Article  6  of  the  GA,  they  are  eligible,  even  if  the 
                beneficiary did not travel and did not take part in the meeting.  
            Force majeure may lead to GA suspension (see Article 49) or GA termination (see Article 50). 
            How?  The  coordinator  must  immediately  formally  notify  the  Commission/Agency  (via  the 
            Funding & Tenders Portal).  
            The beneficiary concerned must quickly put in place all possible measures to limit the damage 
            caused by the force majeure, including measures to limit related costs.

                            Participant Portal Terms & Conditions. For naming the authorised persons, each beneficiary must have 
                            designated — before the signature of this Agreement — a ‘legal entity appointed representative (LEAR)’. 
                            The role and tasks of the LEAR are stipulated in his/her appointment letter (see Participant Portal Terms & 
                            Conditions).   
                            If the electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, instructions will be given on the [Agency and]

                            Communications are considered to have been made when they are sent by the sending party (i.e. on the date 
                            and time they are sent through the electronic exchange system). 
                            Formal notifications through the electronic exchange system are considered to have been made when they 
                            are  received  by  the  receiving  party  (i.e.  on  the  date  and  time  of  acceptance  by  the  receiving  party,  as 
                            indicated by the time stamp). A formal notification that has not been accepted within 10 days after sending 
                            is considered to have been accepted. 
                            Formal notifications on paper sent by registered post with proof of delivery (only after the payment of the 
                            balance) are considered to have been made on either: 
                                     -        the delivery date registered by the postal service or 
                                     -        the deadline for collection at the post office. 
                            If  the  electronic exchange system is temporarily unavailable, the sending party cannot be considered in 
                            breach of its obligation to send a communication within a specified deadline. 
                            52.3              Addresses for communication 
                            The electronic exchange system must be accessed via the following URL: 
                                              [insert URL] 
                            The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the coordinator and beneficiaries in advance any changes to 
                            this URL.

            Formal notifications on paper (only after the payment of the balance) addressed to the beneficiaries must 
             
            be sent to their legal address as specified in the Participant Portal Beneficiary Register. 
             
             
                     
            1.  Communication between the parties — Funding & Tenders Portal electronic 
               exchange system 
            All communication between the consortium and the Commission/Agency — before and after the 
            payment of the balance — must be in electronic form via the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                Beneficiaries will receive Funding & Tender Portal notifications even after the end of the action 
                (and the LEARs are obliged to keep beneficiary contact data up to date, in order to ensure that 
                the communication channels remain active). 
                The responsibility for opening notifications in time is with the beneficiaries.  
                 
                          Formal notifications are normally considered to have been accessed 10 days after they have 
                      been sent (— even not actually opened by recipient, e.g. refusal of reception or omission). Deadlines 
                      that are counted from the date of receipt are counted as of day eleven.  
                      The same is in principle valid for formal notifications after the payment of the balance — except 
                      that  the  Commission/Agency  will  check  that  the  notification  has  actually  been  accessed  by  the 
                      beneficiary  (at  any  time,  before  or  after  the  10  days  deadline).  If  it  was  not  accessed,  the 
                      Commission/Agency will send a second notification, this time on paper  by registered post with proof 
                      of  delivery.  In  that  case,  the  deadlines  will  start  to  run  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the  second 
                      notification.  
                       
             
                       
                The communication via the Funding & Tenders Portal was extended to after the payment of the 
                balance with GA version 4.0. For older grant agreements, it is in principle on paper, unless the 
                          . 
                beneficiary agrees to accept communication via the Funding & Tenders Portal.      
                           
            The Funding & Tenders Portal offers different functions: 
                       
                   viewing and changing the legal entity data in the Participant Register 
                       
                   direct access to the necessary forms and electronic submission for reporting, deliverables 
                       
                    and amendments 
                       
                  contacting the Commission/Agency, via the messages function 
                       
                  formal notifications  
                  where  necessary,  secured  electronic  signatures  (for  instance,  for  signing  the  GA, 
                    accession to the GA, amendments and financial statements). 
            It keeps logs of all communication and allows for delivery of formal notifications with proof of 
            receipt. 
                All messages are recorded in the Funding & Tenders Portal project file (with date and time). 
                Formal notifications are also recorded (with information on when they were sent and received, 
                i.e. date and time the receiving party first accessed the notification, as indicated by the time 
                stamp).

            Access is limited to persons with a user account and authorisation to act for the beneficiary.  
                Authorisation and access are linked to the user role (e.g. LEAR, PLSIGN or PFSIGN). 
                    Examples: 
                    1. Only Legal Signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the GA and amendments. 
                    2. Only Financial Statement Signatories (PFSIGNs) may sign the financial statements. 
                    3. Only Primary Coordinator Contacts (PCoCos) and Coordinator Contacts (CoCo) may submit information to 
                    the Commission. The Primary Coordinator Contact can be changed only by the responsible (project) officer 
                    in the back-office, while the other roles can be managed by the participants themselves via the Portal. (In 
                    case  of  MSCA-IF  the  Supervisor  identified  in  the  proposal  becomes  the  PCoCo,  in  ERC  grants  the  PI 
                    identified in the proposal becomes the PCoCo.) 
                    4.  Only  Participant  Contacts  (PaCos)  may  submit  information  to  the  coordinator.  They  cannot  submit 
                    information directly to the Commission/Agency. 
                    5. Only the Participant Contact(s) (PaCo, or PCoCo and CoCo(s) in case of the coordinator), Legal Signatory 
                    (PLSIGN) or Financial Signatory (PFSIGN) of the recipient beneficiary may access a formal notification for 
                    the first time (i.e. may formally receive it). 
                    6. Task Managers (TaMa) may only complete and save web forms and upload documents related to their 
                    organisation’s  participation  in  the  grant.  They  cannot  submit  information  to  the  coordinator  or  the 
                    Commission. 
                    7. Team Members (TeMe) have read-only access to project information. They cannot complete or save 
                    forms, nor submit information to the coordinator or the Commission/Agency. 
                 
                      For more guidance on access and roles in the Funding & Tenders Portal, see the Portal Online Manual. 
             
            In  principle,  all  communications  from/to  the  Commission/Agency  must  normally  go  via  the 
            coordinator — unless the GA or other rules provide for direct communication with the other 
            beneficiaries  (e.g.  Articles  20,  22,  23,  30,  41,  55;  OLAF  Regulations  No  883/2013  and  No 
            2185/2996).

            Beneficiaries in bankruptcy — If during a beneficiary goes bankrupt during the action, the liquidator 
            may be granted the necessary access rights in the Funding & Tenders Portal, in order to complete the 
            beneficiaries'  obligations.  If  exceptionally  necessary,  the  Commission/Agency  can  also  agree  to 
            communication outside the Funding & Tenders Portal electronic exchange system (i.e. via registered 
            post or e-mails).

                           Annex 2 takes precedence over Annex 1.

                           [OPTION 1 for all international organisations: Nothing in the Agreement may be interpreted as a waiver 
                           of  any  privileges  or  immunities  accorded  to  the  [insert  name  of  international  organisation(s)]  by  its 
                           constituent documents or international law.] 
                           [OPTION 2: Not applicable] 
                            
                            [OPTION: Not applicable] 
                                            
                         1. Privileges and immunities 
                         The Commission/Agency will not take measures against international organisations which would 
                         be  contrary  to  the  privileges  and  immunities  accorded  by  their  constituent  documents  or 
                         international law.  
                                  ‘International organisation’ means intergovernmental organisations (other than the EU) 
                                  with legal personality under international public law (including specialised agencies set up by 
                                  international organisations).  
                                           Examples: International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); International Federation of National Red 
                                           Cross and Red Crescent Societies 
                         Thus in most cases (that is to say, unless the applicable legal texts provide otherwise), public law 
                         decisions  cannot  be  applied  to  international  organisations;  only  contractual  measures  will  be 
                         taken.  
                                  Therefore, the Commission/Agency will not apply enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU 
                                  (see Article 44) or decisions on administrative sanctions (i.e. exclusion or financial penalties; 
                                  see Article 45). 
                                  Similarly, offsetting will be applied only as a contractual measure on the basis of Article 44 GA 
                                  (— never as a public  law  measure  directly  on  the  basis  of  Article  80(1)  of  the  Financial 
                                  Regulation No 966/2012). 
                         By consequence, dispute settlement is normally limited to arbitration (see Article 57.2). The public 
                         law remedies (i.e. Article 263 action) do not apply.

                           ARTICLE 54 — CALCULATION OF PERIODS, DATES AND DEADLINES 
                           In accordance with Regulation No 1182/7156, periods expressed in days, months or years are calculated 
                           from the moment the triggering event occurs. 
                           The day during which that event occurs is not considered as falling within the period. 
                           56        Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time-limits 
                                     (OJ L124, 8.6.1971, p.1) 
                          
                                            
                         1. Periods in days 
                         A period expressed in days starts on the day following the triggering event and ends at midnight of 
                         the last day of the period. Days are calendar days. 
                                  Example: Under Article 20.3, the coordinator must submit a periodic report within 60 days following the end of 
                                  each reporting period. 
                                  The action is divided into the following reporting periods: 
                                           RP1: from 1 March 2015 to 31 August 2016 
                                           RP2: from 1 September 2016 to 28 February 2017 
                                  Therefore, the deadline of 60 days for the first periodic report starts on 1 September 2016 and ends on 30 
                                  October 2016. 
                                  The deadline of 60 days for the second and last periodic report starts on 1 March 2017 and ends on 29 of April 
                                  2017. 
                          
                         2. Periods in months or years 
                         Periods expressed in months or years end at midnight on the day with the same date as the day 
                         on which the period started, in the last month or year of the period. 
                                  Example:  Under  Article  47,  the  Commission/Agency  may  suspend  the  payment  deadline  if  a  request  for 
                                  payment  cannot  be  approved.  The  suspension  takes  effect  on  the  day  the  Commission/Agency  sends  the 
                                  notification. When the suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may ask the Commission/Agency if it will 
                                  continue. The Commission sent the notification for a grant payment deadline on 31 July 2016. Therefore, the 
                                  suspension will have exceeded two months on 30 September 2016. 
                         If that day does not exist (e.g. 31 of April), the period ends at midnight of the last day of that 
                         month (e.g. 30 of April). 
                                  Example: Under Article 22.1.2, reviews may be started up to two years after the balance is paid. A grant’s 
                                  balance is paid on 29 February 2016. Therefore, the two-year period starts on 1 March 2016 and ends on 1 
                                  March 2018.

                         ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT 
                           ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT 
                           55.1 Conditions 
                           The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call 
                           into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                           Amendments may be requested by any of the parties. 
                           55.2 Procedure 
                           The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed in the electronic exchange 
                           system (see Article 52). 
                           The coordinator submits and receives requests for amendment on behalf of the beneficiaries (see Annex 3). 
                           If  a  change of coordinator is requested without its agreement, the submission must be done by another 
                             beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries). 
                           The request for amendment must include: 
                                      -        the reasons why; 
                                      -        the appropriate supporting documents, and 
                                      -        for a change of coordinator without its agreement: the opinion of the coordinator (or proof that this 
                                               opinion has been requested in writing). 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may request additional information. 
                           If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the electronic exchange system 
                             within  45  days  of  receiving  notification  (or  any  additional  information  the  [Commission][Agency]  has 
                           requested). If it does not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The 
                           deadline may be extended, if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within 
                             the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected. 
                           An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party. 
                           An amendment takes effect on the date agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, on the 
                           date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Amendments  
                         When & What? An amendment is necessary whenever there is a need to change the GA (i.e. the 
                         core agreement and/or the Annexes).  
                         H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55                                                                                                                                                                                                   354 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                       The cases where an amendment is necessary are called ‘amendment types’ (AT); the amendment 
                  clauses are called ‘AT clauses’. 
                       The general terms and conditions of the GA can NOT be changed via an amendment. Only GA-specific 
                  data (e.g. duration of the reporting periods, starting date, etc.) and the options in the GA can be added, 
                  removed or updated via an amendment.  
                           Examples:  
                           1. If the JRC should have been a beneficiary but then does not accede to the GA, the options related to 
                           the JRC will be removed.  
                           2. If the JRC is added as a beneficiary during the action, the GA options related to the JRC will be 
                           added to the GA.  
                           3. If a linked third party ends its participation, the option in Article 14.1 will be updated to set its ‘end 
                           date of participation’. 
                       Amendments may NOT result in changes that — if known before awarding the grant — would have 
                  had an impact on the award decision. Those are mostly changes that:  
                          involve  the  consortium  composition  and  have  an  impact  on  the  eligibility  criteria  set  out  in  
                           General  Annexes  A  and  C  to  the  Main  Work  Programme  (e.g.  consortium  of  three  entities 
                           established  in  three  different  Member  States  (BG,  PL  and  FR)  and  replacement  of  the  PL 
                           beneficiary by a BG beneficiary while the call required the representation in the consortium of at 
                           least three Member States) 
                          involve changes to the action and/or its budget and affect the award criteria announced in the 
                           work programme/call (e.g. the tasks in Annex 1 are changed so substantially that the action no 
                           longer corresponds to the scope of the call) 
                          breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants 
                         do not comply with the rules applicable to the GA (i.e. Financial Regulation No 966/2012, Rules 
                          for  Participation  Regulation  No  1290/2013,  etc.)  or  with  provisions  of  the  GA  itself  (e.g. 
                          amendment to subcontract tasks of the coordinator). 
                       Information obligation — Changes in the name, address, legal form and organisation type 
                  AND changes in the legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation may or may 
                  not require an amendment (see below) — but they ALL trigger the information obligation under Article 
                  17.2.  
                  If  such  changes  affect  the  implementation  of  the  action  and  require  an  amendment,  the 
                  Commission/Agency will examine the situation and inform the coordinator. 
                       Examples (change that requires an amendment):  
                       1. Beneficiary A becomes bankrupt. It will be necessary terminate its participation and to amend the GA.  
                       2. Beneficiary B moves from Europe to Australia during the action. The change of address implies that the 
                       beneficiary becomes not eligible for EU funding, so the GA will have to be amended to make it a ‘beneficiary 
                       not receiving EU funding’.  
                       3.  Beneficiary  C  participates  in  an  innovation  action  (IA)  and  loses  its  non-profit  status  during  grant 
                       implementation. It will be necessary to amend the GA to change the reimbursement rate. 
                       Examples (change that does NOT require an amendment):  
                       1. Beneficiary D changes its name. The update in the Participant Register is sufficient; no amendment is 
                       needed. 
                       2.  Beneficiary  E  participates  in  an  SME  instrument  action  and  loses  its  SME-status  during  grant 
                       implementation. No amendment is needed because there is an explicit exception in Article 53(2) of the 
                       Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013.  
                 
                Characteristics of amendments: 
                       Can only be done in writing — an oral agreement is not binding on the parties. 
                       Enters into force after the signature by the coordinator and the Commission/Agency through 
                        an exchange of letters. 
                       Takes effect on the date agreed by the parties (retroactive or in the future); if no date 
                        specified, on the date of the second party approves (not retroactive). 
                       Can only be implemented after the entry into force of the GA and before the final payment 
                        is made. 
                       Must normally be requested before the end of the project; in exceptional cases amendment 
                        clauses are also open after the end of the project (e.g. change of coordinator or change of 
                        coordinator’s bank account, in order to be able to make the final payment).

                       Has to be signed by persons having the same capacity to represent the legal entity as those 
                        who signed the initial GA. 
                       Leaves all the other provisions of the GA which are not affected unchanged and to continue 
                        to have full effect. 
                       Forms an integral part of the GA. 
                       Has to be in line with the rules applicable to the GA (applicable law and EU law), with the 
                        other provisions of the GA and with the applicable model grant agreement. 
                       Cannot have the purpose or effect of making changes to the GA which might call into 
                        question the decision awarding the grant or result in unequal treatment of beneficiaries or 
                        applicants. 
            Normally amendments are done at the initiative of the consortium, but they may also be proposed 
            by the Commission/Agency (e.g. where errors need to be corrected; to change Annex 1 after a 
            review of the action, etc.). 
             
                Sample list of cases where an amendment is necessary: 
                       Removal of a beneficiary whose participation was terminated due to non-accession 
                        to the GA or non-provision of the requested declaration on joint and several liability 
                        (AT1; see Article 50.2 and 50.3) 
                       What? Removal of a beneficiary that never became part of the GA. 
                       How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                       In case of beneficiary termination (by the consortium), the notification of termination and 
                       amendment must be combined.  
                       If the coordinator is removed, the amendment has to propose a new coordinator (AT8). 
                       The changes will be made ex tunc (i.e. since the beginning) since the beneficiary never 
                       participated in the grant. 
                       If the beneficiary was participating with linked third parties/international partners, they will 
                       automatically be removed. 
                       GA  options  for  the  beneficiary  (and  its  linked  third  parties/international  partners)  are 
                       automatically removed/changed/become not applicable (e.g. linked third party options, non-
                       EU beneficiary, JRC, IO, beneficiary receiving/not receiving EU funding). 
                       Annexes 1 and 2 will have to be changed (AT21 and AT31).  
                       Removal of a beneficiary whose participation was terminated for other reasons 
                        (AT2; see Article 50.2 and 50.3) 
                       What? Removal of a beneficiary during the action. 
                       What not? There is NO need to request an amendment if termination takes effect after the 
                       end of the action (see Article 3) — unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator AND 
                       the  amendment  is  necessary  to  comply  with  the  obligation  to  submit  the  reports  and 
                       distribute the payments. 
                       How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                       In case of beneficiary termination (by the consortium), the notification of termination and 
                       amendment must be combined.  
                            If the coordinator is removed, the amendment has to propose a new coordinator (AT8).  
                            Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — If the consortium terminates 
                            the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to change 
                            the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request the 
                            amendment (see Article 50.2 and below point 2).  
                            Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — If the coordinator 
                            must be changed but can no longer submit the request for amendment, the same 
                            procedure as for coordinator change without its agreement should be used.  
            H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55                                                                        356 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                       Changes will be made ex nunc (because the beneficiary participated in the grant up until 
                       termination and, moreover, many obligations are applicable after termination).  
                       The termination date will be added to the Preamble and the beneficiary will be entitled to 
                       submit costs until that date. 
                       If the beneficiary was participating with linked third parties/international partners, they will 
                       also have to be removed (with effect from the same date) and the end date of participation 
                       will be added to Article 14/Article 14a (AT5a/5b). 
                       By contrast, the GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties/international 
                       partners)  will  NOT  be  removed/changed/become  not  applicable  (e.g.  linked  third  party 
                       options, non-EU beneficiary, JRC, IO, beneficiary receiving/not receiving EU funding). 
                       Annexes 1 and 2 will normally have to be changed (AT21 and AT31).  
                      Adding a new beneficiary (AT3; see Article 56.2) 
                       What? Addition of a new beneficiary during the action. 
                       How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                       The new beneficiary must first register (and get validated) in the Participant Register — 
                       unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC).  
                       The accession date will be added to the Preamble of the GA and the beneficiary will be 
                       entitled to submit costs as from that date. 
                            The date must be selected in the Accession Form (attached to the amendment request). 
                            It is possible to choose between: 
                                   the date of signature of the Accession Form 
                                   the date of entry into force of the amendment 
                                OR 
                                   a fixed date: 
                                           retroactive (before signature of the Accession Form)  
                                        OR 
                                           future  (after  signature  of  the  Accession  Form  —  this  should  be  an 
                                            exceptional case with a justification). 
                            Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace a beneficiary that leaves, the 
                            accession  date  may  be  set  before  the  termination  date  (of  the  beneficiary  that  is 
                            replaced) — so that both can incur costs for a certain period.  
                                Example: The former beneficiary ends its participation on 1.6.2015, and the new beneficiary 
                                accedes to the GA on 1.5.2015. 
                       If the new beneficiary is participating with linked third parties/international partners, they 
                       will  also  have  to  be  added  (with  effect  from  the  same  date)  and  the  starting  date  of 
                       participation will be added to Article 14/Article 14a (AT6a/6b). 
                       The GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties/international partners) will be 
                       added/changed/become applicable (e.g. linked third party options, non-EU beneficiary, JRC, 
                       IO, beneficiary receiving/not receiving EU funding). 
                       Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31).  
                       Change of beneficiary due to partial takeover (AT4; called ‘partial transfer of rights 
                        and obligations’ in FP7) 
                        
                               Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a 
                           new  beneficiary  —  without  passing  via  termination  (see  Article  50)  or  addition  of  a  new 
                           beneficiary (see Article 56). 
                           This amendment type should, however, NOT be used if the former beneficiary does NOT leave the 
                           consortium (but stays on as part of the consortium). In this case, simply use the amendment 
                           clause for addition of a new beneficiary (AT3).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                       What? Transfer due to partial takeover. 
                            ‘Partial takeover’ means that a part of the business of the beneficiary — including the 
                            GA — is taken over by (one or more) other entity(ies) (transfer of a business unit as a 
                            going  concern,  e.g.  partial  acquisition,  distribution  of  a  business  unit  after 
                            dissolution/liquidation, division/demerger, etc.).  
                                  ‘Partial acquisition’ means that the original entity continues to exist, but that a 
                                  new entity purchases a department, business unit, or similar (and absorbs or 
                                  takes over part of the rights and obligations of the original entity). Thus, some of 
                                  the rights and obligations (and contracts) of the original entity are transferred to 
                                  the new entity. Since the beneficiary continues to exist as a legal entity and only 
                                  some of its rights and obligations are affected, a case-by-case analysis is needed 
                                  (and an amendment therefore necessary). 
                                        Example: Company X sells its mobile phone division to company Z; all GAs where 
                                        the mobile phone division of X was involved will be affected by the transfer of rights 
                                        and obligations;  other  GAs  where  other  divisions  of  company  X  work  will  not  be 
                                        affected. 
                                  ‘Distribution of a business unit on dissolution/liquidation’ means that the original 
                                  entity disappears (due to dissolution or liquidation), but that (one or more) new 
                                  entities purchase a department, business unit or similar (and absorb or take over 
                                  part of the rights and obligations of the original entity). Since only some of the 
                                  beneficiary’s  rights  and  obligations  are  transferred,  a  case-by-case  analysis  is 
                                  needed (and an amendment therefore necessary). 
                                  ‘Division/demerger’ means that the original entity disappears and several entities 
                                  replace it; different parts of the original entity are transferred to the new entities 
                                  (i.e. several partial transfers to different entities).  
                                        Examples:  
                                        1.  Company  X  has  several  ongoing  grants.  Company  X  is  bought  by  two  other 
                                        companies (Y & Z), one of which will absorb the mobile phone division and the other 
                                        the  remaining  divisions.  For  some  GAs  there  will  be  a  transfer  of  rights  and 
                                        obligations from X to Y, for other GAs it will be from X to Z. 
                                        2. Company Ω has an ongoing grant (covering some action tasks to be implemented 
                                        by  its  engineering  division  and  some  action  tasks  to  be  implemented  by  other 
                                        divisions). Company Ω is bought by two other companies (E and O), one of which 
                                        absorbs the engineering division and the other the remaining divisions. There are two 
                                        partial takeovers: one to company E and one to company O. 
                        What not? Simple sale of (one or more) assets of the beneficiary is NOT a ‘partial takeover’; 
                        it does not involve the transfer of the GA, but — at most — a transfer of (some) action 
                        tasks if the beneficiary can no longer fulfil its action tasks. In this latter case, also the sale 
                        of assets will require an amendment, in order to terminate participation of the beneficiary 
                        and/or add a new beneficiary. 
                                Example: Company Ω implementing two different tasks in an action (engineering and testing) 
                                sells the engineering department to company E with the understanding that E will implement 
                                the engineering tasks of Ω in the action. The GA will have to be amended to add company E as 
                                a new beneficiary; company Ω remains beneficiary in the GA for the other action tasks (e.g. 
                                testing). (If company E is already a beneficiary in the GA, the GA must be amended only to 
                                modify Annexes 1 and 2 to adjust the action tasks and the budget; it is not be necessary to 
                                add E as new beneficiary). 
                            Best practice: In case of doubt, the beneficiaries should contact the Commission/Agency 
                            (via the Funding & Tenders Portal messaging function).  
                        NO amendment is necessary for universal takeovers (see below). 
                        How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries; if the Commission/Agency 
                        agrees,  the  new  entity  will  replace  the  original  entity  as  party  to  the  GA  (as  new 
                        beneficiary). 
                            ‘New beneficiary’ is used here only for the purpose of the amendment; it can be either a 
                            new beneficiary joining the consortium or an already existing beneficiary who took over 
                            a part of the business of another beneficiary.

                             The new beneficiary(ies) will (each) be fully jointly and severally liable with the former 
                          beneficiary for recoveries under Article 44. (By contrast: NO joint and several liability for debts 
                             
                          linked to financial penalties and damages under Articles 45 and Article 46.) 
                              . 
                               
                        If  the  new  beneficiary  joins  the  GA,  it  must  first  register  (and  get  validated)  in  the 
                        Participant Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC). 
                           
                        If the partial takeover is governed by national law, the amendment request must clearly set 
                           
                        out  the  legal  situation  and  the  consequences  for  the  GA  (both  towards  the 
                        Commission/Agency and towards the other beneficiaries). It must, in particular: 
                           
                               explain the financial liability of the former beneficiary 
                               cite the applicable rules (with hyperlinks to the texts, if possible), and 
                               provide a copy of the takeover contract.  
                            Best  practice:  In  order  to  avoid  multiple  submission  of  documents,  beneficiaries  are 
                            recommended  to  upload  the  takeover  contract  in  the  Participant  Register  (via  My 
                            Organisation page) and specify in the amendment request that the legal documents are 
                            available  in  the  Funding  &  Tenders  Portal.  This  is  particularly  useful  if  several  EU  grant 
                            agreements or contracts are affected by a partial takeover. 
                       The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA. 
                            The date must be selected in the amendment request. If the new beneficiary joins the 
                            action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive 
                            dates are only allowed in exceptional cases and with specific justification. 
                       If the former beneficiary was participating with linked third parties/international partners, 
                       the new beneficiary will have to determine which of the former beneficiary’s linked third 
                       parties/international partners stay on as linked third parties/international partners of the 
                       new beneficiary (AT6a/6b) — all other linked third parties/international partners will be 
                       automatically removed. 
                       The GA options for the beneficiary (and its linked third parties/international partners) will be 
                       added/changed/become  applicable  (e.g.  linked  third  party  options,  non-EU  beneficiary, 
                       beneficiary receiving/not receiving EU funding). 
                       Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31). 
                       The former beneficiary does NOT need to submit any reports to the Commission/Agency. 
                       The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must be uploaded with 
                       the next periodic report either by the former beneficiary (for the time it was a beneficiary) 
                       or by the new one together with its own financial statement. 
                       Removing a linked third party/international partner (AT5a/5b; see Articles 14 and 
                        14a) 
                        What? Removal of a linked third party/international partner during the action. 
                        How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                            If  requested  by  the  Commission/Agency  (e.g.  because  of  audit  results  or  an  OLAF 
                            investigation), the consortium MUST submit an amendment to remove a linked third 
                            party/international partner. 
                                      If  the  consortium  does  not  follow-up  this  request,  the  Commission/Agency  may 
                                  terminate the participation of the beneficiary (and thereby also remove the linked third 
                                  party/international partner). 
                                               
                        NO termination notification — Linked third parties/international partners can be removed by 
                        the  consortium  by  simple  amendment;  no  formal  termination  notification  is  required 
                                  The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
                        (termination notification applies only to beneficiaries; see Article 50.2)  
                                  beneficiary  —  without  passing  via  ‘termination’  (Article  50)  or  ‘addition  of  a  new 
                                  beneficiary’ (Article 56). 
                        Changes  will  be  made  ex  nunc  (because  the  linked  third  party/international  partner 
                                   
                        participated in the grant up until removal and, moreover, many obligations are applicable 
                        after termination).  
                                   
                        The end date of participation will be added to Article 14/14a.

                        The  GA  options  for  the  linked  third  party/international  partner  will  normally  NOT  be 
                        removed/changed/become not applicable. 
                        Annexes 1 and 2 will have to be changed (AT21 and AT31). 
                       Adding a linked third party/international partner (AT6a/6b; see Articles 14 and 14a) 
                        What?  Addition of a new linked third party/international partner during the action. 
                        How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                        The new linked third party/international partner must first register (and get validated) in the 
                        Participant Register — unless it already has a validated participant identification code (PIC). 
                        The  name  of  the  linked  third  party/international  partner  and  the  starting  date  of 
                        participation will be added to Article 14/14a. 
                            The date must be selected in the amendment request. It is possible to choose between 
                            a fixed date or the ‘date of entry into force of the amendment’. If the linked third 
                            party/international partner joins the action at the same time as the beneficiary, the 
                            starting  date  of  participation  must  be  the  same  date  as  the  accession  date  of  the 
                            beneficiary. 
                       The    GA  options      for   the   linked   third   party/international   partner    will  be 
                       added/changed/become applicable. 
                        Annexes 1 and 2 will also have to be changed (AT21 and AT31). 
                       Change  concerning  a  beneficiary/linked  third  party  ‘not  receiving  EU  funding’ 
                        (AT7a; see Article 9) 
                        What? If a beneficiary/linked third party — exceptionally — becomes eligible/not eligible for 
                        receiving EU funding during the action (e.g. due to a change of establishment or a country 
                        changing eligibility status) OR if it suddenly requests funding/zero funding, this change will 
                        normally require an amendment (to change Annex 1, Annex 2 and the options in Articles 9 
                        and 57). 
                            Examples:  
                            1. Beneficiary R moves from Europe to Australia and thus is no longer eligible for receiving EU 
                            funding. The GA must be amended. If R is participating with a linked third party M established in 
                            France, M will continue being eligible for funding. 
                            2. The country in which beneficiary X is established leaves the EU (without an agreement ensuring 
                            continued eligibility). The beneficiary is therefore no longer eligible for funding and the GA may 
                            have to be amended (or terminated; see Article 50). 
                            3.  Beneficiary  Y  is  eligible  but  signed  the  grant  with  zero  funding.  During  the  action  the 
                            responsibilities within the consortium are shifted and beneficiary Y takes on a bigger role involving 
                            more costs. The other consortium members agree to adapt the budget and renounce to some 
                            funding in order to allow beneficiary Y to claim funding.  
                             
                                  Costs become automatically ineligible as from the date of loss of eligibility (see Article 6). 
                                   
                        How? This amendment can normally be triggered only by the Commission/Agency. 
                               
                       Change of coordinator (AT8) 
                               
                        What?  Replacement  of  the  coordinator  during  the  action  (e.g.  because  of  financial 
                               
                        difficulties).  
                        Exceptionally, an amendment remains possible and necessary after the end of the action 
                               
                        (see Article 3) — until the payment of the balance is paid out and distributed.  
                               
                        Coordinator in  bankruptcy/liquidation/administration  (or  similar)  —  After  the  end  of  the 
                        action,  if  the  coordinator  can  continue  its  participation  with  the  bank  account  of  the 
                        administrator/liquidator (i.e. termination and coordinator change not really needed), it is 
                        therefore exceptionally sufficient to change the bank account (AT40) without changing the 
                        coordinator.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                        What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for a change of the person in charge 
                        of the coordination of the project (since the person’s name is not mentioned in the GA).  
                         
                                    Information obligation — In case of a change of person in charge of coordination, 
                                the coordinator must  — in addition to updating the data in the Funding & Tenders Portal 
                                inform the Commission/Agency under Article 17.2). 
                                     
                        How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                                 
                        If the new coordinator is not already a beneficiary of the GA, it must first accede to the GA 
                                 
                        as a new beneficiary (AT3).  
                                 
                        The former coordinator may continue to participate in the action as a normal beneficiary or 
                        may terminate its participation (AT2). 
                                 
                            Termination of the coordinator without its agreement — If the consortium terminates 
                                 
                            the coordinator without its agreement, it must provide proof of its decision to change 
                            the coordinator and nominate one of the beneficiaries to act on its behalf to request the 
                            amendment (see Article 50.2 and below point 2). 
                            Coordinator in bankruptcy/liquidation/administration (or similar) — If the coordinator 
                            must  be  changed  but  can  no  longer  submit  the  amendment  request,  the  same 
                            procedure as for coordinator change without its agreement should be used. 
                        The handover date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
                            The date must be selected in the amendment request (fixed date or date of entry into 
                            force of the amendment).  
                            The date the former coordinator stops acting as coordinator should normally be the date 
                            the new coordinator takes over the coordination tasks (handover date). If there was a 
                            gap (former coordinator leaves before new coordinator starts; e.g. coordinator is in 
                            bankrupcy) there will be two different dates: the one for the former coordinator (when it 
                            stopped doing coordinator tasks — must be at the latest its termination date) and the 
                            one for the new coordinator (when it took over the coordinator tasks —  must be after 
                            its accession date). 
                       Change of the coordinator’s bank account for payments (AT40) 
                        What? An amendment is necessary for all changes that imply a change to the account 
                        number/IBAN code.  
                            Example: The coordinator changes bank account. 
                        What not? NO amendment is necessary for a change of the name of the bank or name of 
                        the account holder; a change of the bank account data (and validation) in the Funding & 
                        Tenders Portal Participant Register is sufficient. 
                        How? The bank account data must first be updated in the Participant Register (and be 
                        validated). 
                       Change of the starting date, action duration or reporting periods (AT23, AT24, 
                        AT25) 
                        What? Change of the action’s schedule (starting date, action duration or reporting periods). 
                            Example: The GA for the action has a fixed starting date that is before the date on which the GA 
                            enters into force. Because of weather conditions, the consortium cannot start on that date and 
                            requests the Commission to change it. 
                         
                                   Even if the action is prolonged, the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1) will NOT be 
                             increased.  
                         
                              
                        How? An extension of the action must be requested before the action ends and will only be 
                        accepted in exceptional cases.  
                                 . 
                       Changes to Annex 1 (description of the action) (AT21)  
                                  
                        What? Changes to the description of the action, in particular: 
                              
                              
            H2020 > Chapter 7 > Article 55                                                                        361 
                              
                              
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
                               significant change of the action tasks (e.g. if tasks are added/removed) or of their 
                                division among the beneficiaries  
                               changes concerning in-kind contributions provided by third parties (against payment 
                                or free of charge) or subcontracts 
                                Such changes could in principle also be made via simplified approval procedure (see 
                                Articles 11, 12 and 13); however, if the beneficiary requests an amendment, it will 
                                immediately know if the Commission/Agency agrees (or not). Without amendment, 
                                this decision is left for later and the Commission/Agency may reject the costs as 
                                ineligible later on (at the moment of the payment). 
                               changes concerning the tasks to be carried out by linked third parties and related 
                                costs (including if a linked third party is removed) 
                               significant changes to the plan for exploitation and dissemination (unless Annex 1 
                                already foresees an update to be submitted with the periodic report)  
                               changes concerning GA options (options are removed or added, e.g. adding the 
                                options to provide trans-national access to research infrastructure requires normally 
                                a modification of Annex 1 and/or Annex 2) 
                               significant changes concerning deliverables (e.g. changes of ethics requirements to 
                                align to ethical principles and legislation; adding/removing deliverables; changes in 
                                substance of a project output which is reflected in a deliverable, etc.). 
                        What not? Changes to the due date of a deliverable normally do not require an amendment 
                        (except for certain deliverables, where timeliness is key)  
                         
                       Changes to Annex 2 and Annex 2a (estimated budget) or specific unit costs (AT31 
                        and AT36) 
                        What? Changes to the estimated budget, in particular:  
                               a budget transfer of amounts between beneficiaries or between budget categories 
                                (or both) which are linked to a significant change in the action’s work (i.e. Annex 1) 
                               a budget transfer to a form of costs that is not used by the beneficiary (i.e. with 0 
                                EUR costs in Annex 2) — except for transfer of amounts within the budget category 
                                A  ‘personnel  costs’  and  for  transfers  to  the  budget  category  'costs  of  internally 
                                invoiced goods and services'. 
                                    Example: 
                                    During the action implementation, the beneficiary decides to use the access costs for 
                                    transnational access to research infrastructure unit cost. This requires an amendment to 
                                    fix the unit cost and to move budget to budget category F.2.  
                        What not? There is NO need to request an amendment for changes covered by the budget 
                        transfers  rule  in  Article  4.2  (e.g.  budget  transfers  within  the  personnel  cost;  see  also 
                        below). 
                        How? The amendment is normally triggered by the beneficiaries. 
                        Best practice: If Annex 2a or specific unit costs need to be changed, the beneficiaries should 
                        contact the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal messaging function).  
                Sample list of cases where NO amendment is needed: 
                       Budget transfers not listed above 
                        Transfers of amounts between beneficiaries or between budget categories (or both) do NOT 
                        require an amendment, provided that the action is implemented in line with Annex 1 (see 
                        Article 4.2). 
                        Budget  transfers  within  the  personnel  cost  category  and  budget  transfers  to  costs  of 
                        internally  invoiced goods and services are possible without having to amend the GA. 
                            Examples: 
                            1. During the action implementation, a beneficiary that declared its direct personnel costs as actual 
                            costs decides to change this and instead to declare them as unit costs in accordance with its usual 
                            accounting practices (average personnel costs).

                            2. An SME joins an on-going GA. The SME owner does not have a salary but incorrectly budgets its 
                            costs as actual personnel costs (category A.1). He realises the mistake and then switches to the 
                            unit costs for SME owners (category A.4).  
                       Change of name, address or other legal entity data (of beneficiaries/linked third 
                        parties) 
                        Simple changes of name, legal form (e.g. Ltd., S.A.), official registration number, address, 
                        VAT number do NOT require an amendment; an update of the beneficiary data by the LEAR 
                        (and validation) in the Participant Register is normally sufficient.  
                            Linked third parties/international partners — Since they normally do not have direct 
                            access  to  the  Participant  Register,  linked  third  parties/international  partners  must 
                            inform their beneficiary who must inform the Commission/Agency. The data will then be 
                            updated by the Commission/Agency (and validated). 
                            If (exceptionally) the Commission/Agency considers that the registered change affects 
                            the  implementation  of  the  action,  it  will  inform  the  coordinator  (and  instruct  it  to 
                            request an amendment or trigger itself an amendment, if needed).  
                                Example: Company R moves from Europe to Australia and this implies that the beneficiary is 
                                no longer eligible for EU funding. In such a case, the Commission will make an amendment to 
                                the GA to change the beneficiary status into ‘beneficiary not receiving EU funding’. 
                        Short names have no legal value and only serve as easy identifiers in the GA. If needed, 
                        they can be changed in the context of an amendment initiated on other grounds. 
                        A change of the person that represent the coordinator for the purposes of signing the GA 
                        requires NO follow-up at all (not even a change in the Participant Register — since this 
                        name is only relevant at the moment of GA signature (not afterwards). 
                       Change of beneficiary due to universal takeover (called ‘universal transfer of rights 
                        and obligations’ in FP7).  
                        Transfers of the GA linked to a universal takeover (i.e. where the original entity is replaced 
                        by one new entity and all the rights and obligations — including the GA — are transferred to 
                        this new entity, e.g. merger or full acquisition) do NOT require an amendment; an update of 
                        the beneficiary data by the LEAR (and validation) in the Participant Register is normally 
                        sufficient.  
                            Example: Beneficiary X merges with another existing entity Y by: 
                                          becoming part of it (thus X and Y are together known as ‘Y’, and entity X ceases 
                                           to exist) or  
                                          establishing a new separate legal entity (X and Y are together known as ‘Z’). 
                        If — exceptionally — the Commission/Agency considers that the registered transfer affects 
                        the  action  implementation,  it  will  inform  the  coordinator  (and  instruct  it  to  request  an 
                        amendment, if needed). 
                            Example:  
                            The legal form or type of organisation of the new entity differs from that of the former beneficiary 
                            or linked third party and this has an impact on the implementation of the action.  
                            Case 1: The coordinator transfers all its rights and obligations to another legal entity. If this 
                            involves a change of the bank account number in Article 21.8, each GA in which it participates as 
                            coordinator must be amended to update this information (AT40). 
                            Case 2: A non-profit legal entity X is acquired by a big for-profit company Y; as a result of the 
                            acquisition Y assumes the rights and obligations of X in on-going innovation actions (IAs). The 
                            reimbursement rate applicable to Y in those on-going GAs will differ from that of X since the new 
                            beneficiary will not be entitled to a reimbursement rate of 100% (but only to a reimbursement rate 
                            of 70%). The GA must be amended to change the reimbursement rate (AT33) and the estimated 
                            budget (AT31). 
                            For on-going RIA grants there will be no need to modify Annex 2 since the reimbursement rate is 
                            the same for all beneficiaries (100%).

                       Information obligation — In case of a universal takeover, the beneficiary must  — in 
                         
                  addition to updating the data in the Participant Register— inform the coordinator (offline) under 
                  Article 17.2, if the universal takeover could: 
                         
                          significantly affect or delay the implementation of the action or the EU financial interests or 
                             
                          affect the decision to award the grant or the compliance with requirements under the GA. 
                      The coordinator must then inform the Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal) 
                      and, if necessary, request an amendment.  
                  The same applies if the universal takeover concerns a linked third party.

              Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.   
                                                                                                                       
             
            2. Procedure 
            How? Amendment requests must be prepared by the requesting party (i.e. the coordinator or 
            the Commission/Agency) directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                    Best practice: If none of the available amendment clauses fit, beneficiaries should contact the 
                    Commission/Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal messaging function), to discuss the 
                    amendment. 
                       Before the amendment request, new beneficiaries, new linked third parties or other new beneficiary 
                  data must have been registered and validated in the Participant Register. 
                      Examples: 
                      1. A new beneficiary must be validated (legal entity validation). This means that the new beneficiary will first 
                      have  to  register  in  the  Participant  Register,  be  validated,  appoint  a  LEAR,  and  provide  the  necessary 
                      information and supporting documents through the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                      2. Validation of the new bank account, to change the bank account.  
                   
                   
                      The amendment request must include the necessary information and supporting documents. A signed 
                  and submitted amendment request can NOT be changed — only accepted, rejected or withdrawn. It is 
                      . 
                  however possible to provide clarifications or additional information/documents. 
                       
                      For more guidance on amendments, see the Guide on amendment types & supporting documents and 
                  the Portal Online Manual. 
                   
                   
                   
                   
                The request must be unambiguous and complete and submitted in time (i.e. sufficiently in 
                   
                   
                advance to allow proper analysis and preparation before they are due to take effect and — 
                   
                generally — before the end of the action; see Article 3). Requests introduced AFTER the end of 
                      . 
                the action will be accepted only exceptionally, for very specific (duly substantiated) cases (e.g. 
                   
                change of bank account, change of coordinator to make the payment of the balance). 
                       
                The coordinator must ensure that it has the agreement of the consortium (in accordance with 
                   
                the internal decision-making processes, e.g. unanimity, simple or qualified majority, etc. set 
                   
                out in the consortium agreement). 
                   
            Once completed, the request (with all its uploaded supporting documents) must be submitted 
            and signed by the PLSIGN of the coordinator (on behalf of the other beneficiaries; see Annex 3). 
                   
               Termination  of  the  coordinator  without  its  agreement  —  For  change  of  coordinator 
                   
               without its agreement a special procedure applies: The other beneficiaries must nominate one 
               of them to act on their behalf to notify termination and request the amendment. The nominated 
               beneficiary must name a contact person responsible for the amendment.  
               Before  it  has  been  accepted  or  rejected,  an  amendment  request  may  at  any  moment  be 
               withdrawn.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     General MGA 
               In order to change the amendment request, it must be withdrawn and re-submitted (changes 
               to submitted requests are NOT possible). 
                    Example: The coordinator requests an amendment to change its bank account number and the reallocation 
                    of tasks in Annex 1 and of budget in Annex 2. Since the change of bank account is urgent because the 
                    Commission has to make the interim payment and the revision of the Annexes may require more time, the 
                    coordinator withdraws the request and makes a new request to change only the bank account and a second 
                    one to change the Annexes. 
                A request containing several changes to the GA will be considered as one (and must either be 
                agreed or rejected by the other party as a whole).  
                If  the  receiving  party  requests  additional  information/documents,  a  new  deadline  will 
                apply, i.e. 45 days from receiving the additional information/documents. 
                    Example: The coordinator submits a request to add a new beneficiary with several linked third parties (see 
                    Article 14). The Commission requests a signed declaration for the joint and several liability of the linked 
                    third parties (Annex 3a). A new 45-day deadline for evaluation and validation will apply from the moment 
                    the Commission receives the declaration. 
            The other party must — within 45 days — agree or disagree.  
                The deadline may exceptionally be extended by the receiving party — for a period to be 
                determined case-by-case —, if necessary for the assessment of the request (e.g. a review is 
                needed to assess the changes). 
                If accepted it will be counter-signed by the receiving party directly in the Funding & Tenders 
                Portal (for the consortium: by the PLSIGN of the coordinator). 
                If there is no reaction within the deadline, the request is considered to have been rejected 
                (   new in Horizon 2020: contrary to FP7, there is NO tacit approval of amendments). A new 
                amendment request may however be submitted — even if it fully or partly repeats the initial 
                request. 
            The amendment enters into force and is binding from the moment the receiving party has 
            agreed to it (i.e. signed in the Funding & Tenders Portal).  
            The amendment will take effect (i.e. the changes to the GA will start to apply) either: 
                   on the day of its entry into force (i.e. day of the last signature of the amendment) or  
                   on the specific date(s) indicated (and agreed) in the amendment. 
                    The date should normally be after the entry into force of the amendment.  
                        In justified cases it may — exceptionally — be before (retroactivity of the amendment). 
                        (In some cases, the GA itself provides for retroactivity.)  
                            Examples (retroactivity allowed/foreseen in the GA): 
                            1. Where a new beneficiary is added to the GA (AT3), it must assume the rights and obligations 
                            from the accession date specified in the Accession Form. If this date is before the entry into force 
                            of the amendment, this retroactivity implies that its costs will be considered eligible as from the 
                            accession date (and not as from the entry into force of the amendment). 
                            2.  Following  a  suspension  of  the  implementation  of  the  action  by  the  beneficiary  or  by  the 
                            Commission, the suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the 
                            amendment (AT26). This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force 
                            (see Article 49.2.2). 
                            3. If the amendment intends to correct an error (AT60), the change will be made with effect from 
                            entry into force of the GA (i.e. from the beginning). 
                    Depending on the amendment type, the date of taking effect may have an impact on the 
                    eligibility of costs. 
                    An amendment request involving several changes, may take effect on different dates. 
                        Example:

                        On 1 May 2016, the coordinator requests an amendment to change the bank account and to add a new 
                        beneficiary. The addition of the beneficiary takes effect from the date of its accession, as specified in 
                        the Accession Form (1 April 2016), while the change of bank account takes effect on a date agreed by 
                        the parties or on the date on which the amendment enters into force (i.e. 10 June 2016, the day it is 
                        signed by the receiving party).

                            If a beneficiary does not accede to the Agreement within the above deadline, the coordinator must — within

                         1. Accession to the GA (beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble) 
                         All beneficiaries (except the coordinator) must accede to the GA by signing the Accession Form 
                         (see Annex 3) directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. They must do this within 30 days after 
                         the GA enters into force (see Article 58). 
                                  Only the beneficiaries’ legal signatories (PLSIGNs) may sign the Accession Forms. 
                                  Declarations on joint and several liability (see Annex 3a) must be signed by the linked third 
                                  party on paper and send it to its beneficiary. The beneficiary must scan it and upload it in PDF 
                                  format, before signing the Accession Form.  
                                           Without  the  declaration,  it  will  NOT  be  able  to  accede  to  the  GA  (and  thus  NOT  be 
                                           considered a party to the GA). 
                                                       Record-keeping — The beneficiary must keep the original of the linked third party in its files (see 
                                                Article 18.1.2). 
                                                 
                                  Linked third parties do not become parties to the GA and therefore do NOT need to sign an

                         The coordinator is not obliged to distribute hard copies of the GA and Accession Form to the

                           56.2               Addition of new beneficiaries 
                           In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary. 
                           For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 55. It must 
                           include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic exchange system 
                            (see Article 52). 
                           New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
                           their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                           MONO-BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT 
                           Not applicable 
                          
                                            
                         1. Addition of new beneficiaries (amendment) 
                         In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request adding a new beneficiary. 
                                   The new beneficiary must comply with the eligibility criteria of the work programme/call, have 
                                   sufficient operational and financial capacity to perform the proposed tasks, comply with the 
                                   non-exclusion  criteria  and  commit  to  implement  the  action  under  the  same  terms  and 
                                   conditions as the other beneficiaries. 
                                   Article 56 does not apply to mono-beneficiary actions. Mono-beneficiary actions can therefore 
                                   NOT become multi-beneficiary actions.  
                         How? The new beneficiary must: 
                                          register  in  the  Participant  Register  and  be  validated  —  unless  it  already  has  a  validated 
                                           participant identification code (PIC) 
                                          sign the Accession Form (directly in Funding & Tenders Portal) 
                                          provide a declaration on joint and several liability of its linked third party (if required by the 
                                           Commission/Agency). 
                         The coordinator must request an amendment for adding a new beneficiary (see Article 55). 
                         The Accession Form (attached to the amendment request) must specify the accession date. It 
                         must be either:  
                                                  the date of signature of the Accession Form 
                                                  the date of entry into force of the Amendment 
                                           OR 
                                                  a fixed date: 
                                                                    either retroactive (i.e. before signature of the Accession Form)  
                                                            OR 
                                                                    future  (i.e.  after  signature  of  the  Accession  Form  —  this  should  be  an 
                                                                     exceptional case with a justification). 
                                  Handover period — If a new beneficiary joins to replace  a  beneficiary  that  leaves,  the 
                                  accession date may be set before the termination date (of the beneficiary that is replaced) — 
                                  so that both can incur costs for a certain period.

                  new in Horizon 2020: This is new compared to FP7, where (instead of a horizontal approach for all 
              international organisations which cannot accept EU law) it was necessary to make specific provisions 
              (special clause 3), in order to accommodate, for example, the participation of specialised agencies and 
              international  organisations  of  the  UN  family.  It  makes  it  easier  for  international  organisations  to 
              participate in Horizon 2020.

                             57.2              Dispute settlement 
                             If  a  dispute  concerning  the  interpretation,  application  or  validity  of  the  Agreement  cannot  be  settled 
                             amicably, the General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice of the European Union — has sole 
                             jurisdiction. Such actions must be brought under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU 
                             (TFEU).

                             Justice): As an exception, if such a dispute is between the [Commission][Agency] and [insert non-EU 
                             beneficiary(ies) name(s)], the competent Belgian courts have sole jurisdiction.] 
                              [additional OPTION for international organisations and for beneficiaries not eligible for  EU funding, 
                             which according to their national law cannot be subject to the jurisdiction of the Belgian courts: As an 
                             exception, for the following beneficiaries:

                                      [same for other beneficiaries that are international organisations or non-EU beneficiaries not eligible 
                                      for  EU funding] 
                             such disputes must — if they cannot be settled amicably — be referred to arbitration.  The Permanent Court 
                             of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitration Involving International Organisations and States in force at 
                             the date of entry into force of the Agreement will apply. The appointing authority will be the Secretary-
                             General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration following a written request submitted by either party. The 
                             arbitration proceedings must take place in Brussels and the language used in the arbitral proceedings will 
                             be English. The arbitral award will be binding on all parties and will not be subject to appeal.] 
                             If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU 
                             (see Articles 44, 45 and 46), the beneficiaries must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, 
                             the Court of Justice of the European Union — under Article 263 TFEU. [OPTION for Agency grants: 
                             Actions against offsetting and enforceable decisions must be brought against the Commission (not against 
                             the Agency).] 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                          
                                            
                         1. Dispute settlement 
                         As  a  general  rule,  H2020  GAs  contain  an  Article  272  TFEU  arbitration  clause  —  referring 
                         contractual disputes (i.e. disputes on the interpretation, application or validity of the GA) to the 
                         European Court of Justice.  
                                  An Article  272  action  is  ONLY  possible  once  the  Commission/Agency  position  is  final  (i.e. 
                                  against confirmation letters, debit notes, etc.; NOT against audit reports, audit letters, pre-
                                  information letters, etc.). 
                                  For Commission grants, actions must be brought against the Commission; for Agency grants, 
                                  they must be brought against the Agency (information is available both in the Preamble of 
                                  your GA and in SyGMa). 
                         For disputes of public law nature (i.e. which concern administrative sanctions, offsetting or 
                         enforceable decisions under Article 299 TFEU; see Articles 44, 45 and 46), actions must be 
                         brought before the European Court of Justice under Article 263 TFEU (NOT before any other court 
                         and NOT under Article 272).

                          Public law measures must ALWAYS be brought to the European Court of Justice under Article 263 TFEU 
                    (including actions brought by non-EU beneficiaries or beneficiaries not receiving EU funding). 
                          All procedures are organised in a way that the beneficiaries will always be informed about what they can do 
                     if they disagree (means of redress information in the letters). 
                   
                   
                  Specific cases (dispute settlement): 
                  Non-EU beneficiaries — For non-EU beneficiaries, contractual disputes  are normally referred to the 
                  courts  of  Brussels,  Belgium.  They  can  NOT  choose  another  forum.  (So  far  NONE  of  the  H2020 
                  association agreements provides for the sole jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.) 
                  Disputes of public law nature remain before the European Court of Justice. 
                  Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding — Beneficiaries not receiving EU funding which  are not 
                  eligible (meaning from a third country not eligible for funding; see Article 9) are treated like non-EU 
                  beneficiaries (i.e. courts of Brussels), unless  their national law explicitly provides that they cannot be 
                  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Belgian  courts.  In  this  latter  case  (very  exceptional),  contractual 
                  disputes are referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. 
                  Disputes of public law nature remain before the European Court of Justice. 
                  International organisations — For international organisations, contractual disputes are referred to 
                  the Permanent Court of Arbitration (in line, for instance, with their PAGODA agreement, e.g. for the 
                  United  Nations,  the  Financial  and  Administrative  Framework  Agreement  (FAFA)  with  the  United 
                              72
                  Nations ). 
                  Disputes of public law will normally not arise, since international organisations are normally accorded 
                  immunity from public law decisions (under their constituent documents or international law). Such 
                  international organisations can therefore be subject only to contractual measures and to contractual 
                  dispute settlement (i.e. arbitration). 
                         For this reason, the Commission/Agency will normally NOT adopt enforceable decisions under Article 
                         299 TFEU (see Article 44) or decisions on administrative sanctions (see Article 45). 
                         Similarly, offsetting will always be applied only as a contractual measure on the basis of Article 44 
                         GA (NOT as a public law measure directly on the basis of Article 80(1) of the Financial Regulation 
                         No 966/2012). 
                  For  international  organisations  that  have  NO  immunity,  disputes  of  public  law  remain  before  the 
                  European Court of Justice.

                         II.1 Background information and approach 
                         The European Research Council (ERC) Model Grant Agreements are used for ERC actions only. 
                         The ERC gives: 
                                    ‘frontier research grants’, i.e.: 
                                                           ERC Starting Grants (StG) 
                                                           ERC Consolidator Grants (CoG)  
                                                           ERC Advanced Grants (AdG) 
                                                           ERC Synergy Grants (SyG) 
                                    proof of concept grants (PoC), i.e.: 
                                                           ERC PoC 
                                                           ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot 
                                    ERC Low Value grants. 
                         Frontier research actions use the H2020 ERC MGA. For ERC PoC, there are two specific MGAs: the 
                         standard ERC PoC MGA (based on actual costs reimbursement) and the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot 
                         MGA with a pre-fixed amount of EUR 150 000. A specific MGA also exists for ERC Low Value 
                         grants. Other ERC actions (coordination and support actions (CSA)) use the H2020 General MGA. 
                         The ERC MGAs follow the General MGA for numbering and content, except for: 
                          
                                                  All ERC MGAs deviate from the General MGA as follows: 
                                                                  ‘Coordinator’ is replaced by ‘principal beneficiary’ (also in the Annexes) 
                                                                  [Agency][Commission] is replaced by ‘Agency’ 
                                                                  References to/options for Euratom are taken out 
                                                                  ‘Technical report(s)’ is replaced by ‘scientific report(s)’  
                                                                  The table of contents is adapted 
                                                                  Cross-references in the footnotes are adapted

            The  annotations  will  concentrate  on  differences  in  substance  and  interpretation  that  require 
            explanation.  
                Parts that do not apply or differ only in presentation (e.g. Articles 11.1, 12.1, 13.1, 50.1.1, 
                50.1.2., 50.2.2, 50.3.1, 50.3.2., 50.3.3., 15 and 16, Annexes) will not be shown. 
                For the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA, the Articles where the only difference is the removal of 
                references to eligibility of costs (e.g. Article 14, 17.1, 22.5, 41.2 – removal of CFS —) or 
                rejection of costs (e.g. Articles 14.2, 18.2, 22.6) will not be shown. 
                By contrast, provisions that do not deviate from the General MGA, but that require clarification 
                or a specific interpretation for ERC actions are added:  
                       Article 2 (ERC MGA actions; ERC MGA PoC actions) 
                       Article 4.1 (ERC MGA budget categories) 
                       Article 6 (ERC MGA eligible and ineligible costs) 
                       Article 8 (ERC MGA rules on third party involvement) 
            Since  the  ERC  MGA  and  the  standard  ERC  PoC  MGA  have  a  similar  set-up  (i.e.  principal 
            beneficiary, host institution, principal investigator) and provisions, the annotations of the standard 
            ERC PoC MGA will be limited to major differences from the ERC MGA.  
            For the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA, the annotations will focus mainly on differences arising 
            from the cost models (lump sum versus actual costs reimbursement). 
            The annotations (for all three MGAs) are based on the multi-beneficiary version. The differences 
            between multi and mono-beneficiary versions are marginal. For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot, there is 
            a single MGA for both mono- and multi-beneficiary actions.

                 1. Participants: Principal beneficiary — Beneficiaries — Host institution 
                 In ERC grants, the coordinator is called ‘principal beneficiary’. 
                 The  ‘host  institution  (HI)’  is  the  beneficiary  that  hosts  (and  normally  also  engages)  the 
                 ‘principal investigator (PI)’ for at least the duration of the action.  
                  
                 2. Participants: Principal investigator(s) 
                 For ERC grants, the main researcher (i.e. the principal investigator (PI)) is named in the GA.  
                 ERC                                                                                                                                                   379 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             ERC 
                PIs can be of any nationality, if they intend to conduct research in an EU Member State or 
                H2020 associated country and are hosted (and usually engaged) by a host institution that is 
                based in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country.  
                Due to the key role of the PI, s/he can NOT be replaced by any other researcher during the 
                action. Requests for amendments to change the PI will be rejected. 
                PI time commitments — The PI must comply with certain minimum requirements regarding 
                working time on the action (fixed in Annex 1 and 2) and working time in an EU Member State 
                or H2020 associated country (set out in the work programme/call). 
                The Agency must be informed before any change in employment or location of the PI.  
                Should the PI move to another host institution (in an EU Member State or H2020 associated 
                country), the GA can be transferred to the new host institution (portability; see Article 56a). 
                If the PI moves to an institution established in a non-associated  third country, the GA may be 
                terminated (see Article 50.1 H2020 General MGA).  
                In case of breach, the Agency may terminate the GA or take any of the other Chapter 6 
                measures (e.g. grant reduction, recovery of payments already made, etc.; see Articles 42-44, 
                47-50 H2020 General MGA). 
            PIs  do  not  become  party  to  the  GA,  but  they  are  the  key  actors  in  charge  of  the  research 
            activities. However, it is the host institution that subscribes to the financial and legal obligations 
            under the GA — since it is the beneficiary.  
                Examples: 
                1. A PI can choose its own research team. This team is the research team of the PI and thus different from that 
                of a network or consortium. The engagement of the team follows the rules of the beneficiary and its country. 
                2. PIs must be supported by their host institution during the entire action duration.  
            In order to govern their internal relationship (during the action), PIs and their host institutions 
            must sign a supplementary agreement (SA) (see Article 32). The supplementary agreement 
            can NOT replace the employment/engagement contract and is not sufficient by itself. 
             
            Specific cases (PIs):  
            PI employed/engaged by a third party — Exceptionally, the PI may be employed/engaged not by 
            the beneficiary but by a third party (from an EU Member State or H2020 associated country), i.e.:  
                   a third party that provides the PI as in-kind contribution or  
                   a linked third party (see Article 8).  
            This must be specifically justified in the proposal and included in Annex 1.  
            In  this  case,  the  supplementary  agreement  (see  Article  32)  must  be  signed  by  the  PI,  the  host 
            institution AND the third party. 
            Retired PI — The PI may be retired. 
            Several PIs — ERC Synergy grants have several PIs (but only one principal beneficiary and one of the 
            PIs that acts as ‘correspondent PI’). Each host institution must conclude a supplementary agreement 
            with the PI(s) they engage. 
            No supplementary agreement — NO supplementary agreement is needed for ERC PoC grants. 
            PI entitled to sign the supplementary agreement — If the PI is entitled to sign the supplementary 
            agreement  on  behalf  of  the  host  institution  (because  of  his/her  position  in  the  institution),  the 
            supplementary agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. 
            The principal investigator can NOT sign his/her own supplementary agreement for both parties. 
            Grant portability — If  the  GA  is  transferred  to  another  host  institution  (see  Article  56a)  a  new 
            supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution (and forwarded to the Agency). 
            The GA cannot be amended before the PI has sent the new supplementary agreement.

                         1. ERC frontier research actions 
                         What? ERC frontier research grants fund: 
                                         ground-breaking,  high-gain/high-risk  research  at  the  frontiers  of  knowledge  (‘frontier 
                                          research’) in any field of research (except nuclear energy), by one (or more) principal 
                                          investigator(s) and their research team. 
                         ERC actions are normally mono-beneficiary actions, but can also be multi-beneficiary. 
                         ERC actions are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘European Research Council’ (e.g. ERC-
                         2015-STG).

                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked

                         1. Budget categories 
                         The ERC MGA uses in principle the same budget categories as the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the ERC MGA: 
                                                  direct personnel costs 
                                                                    costs for employees (or equivalent) 
                                                                    costs for natural persons working under a direct contract 
                                                                    costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment 
                                                                    costs for SME owners without salary 
                                                                    costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary 
                                                  direct costs of subcontracting 
                                                  other direct costs 
                                                                    travel costs and related subsistence allowances 
                                                                    equipment costs 
                                                                    costs of other goods and services 
                                                                    capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure 
                                                                    costs of internally invoiced goods and services 
                                                  indirect costs.  
                                  Thus, the ERC MGA does NOT have:                                                                  
                                             personnel costs for providing trans-national access to research infrastructure 
                                             direct costs of providing financial support to third parties  
                                             specific cost categories. 
                          
                                   The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                             5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).

                           The grant reimburses 100% of the beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] eligible costs for the action (see 
                            Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                           The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following forms (‘forms of costs’): 
                                  (a)         for direct personnel costs:

                                                 -        on the basis of an amount per unit calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual

                                              (see Article 6.2, Points A.4 and A.5) must be declared on the basis of the amount per unit set out in

                  2. Cost forms  
                  For ERC actions, the cost forms are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5 
                  H2020 General MGA). 
                  However, the ERC MGA does not use all the unit costs and flat-rates of the General MGA:  
                         Like  the  General  MGA,  it  uses  the  unit  cost  for  personnel  costs  on  the  basis  of  the 
                         beneficiaries’  usual  accounting  practices  (average  personnel  costs), the  unit  costs  for  SME 
                         owners and beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary, the unit costs for internally 
                                                                                                                                                  73
                         invoiced goods and services and the flat-rate of 25% for indirect costs.  
                         It does NOT use the unit costs of category F ‘specific cost categories’ of the General MGA.

                           Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following budget categories: 
                                     A.  direct personnel costs;  
                                     B.  direct costs of subcontracting;

                                     F.  not applicable. 
                           ‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed to 
                            it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point E below). 
                          
                            ‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
                           attributed directly to it.

                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions per budget category. 
                         The ERC MGAs use in principle the same budget categories (covering the same types of costs) 
                         as the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA) — with the exception of categories C. 
                         ‘financial support to third parties’ and F ‘specific cost categories’. 
                         The same eligibility conditions and calculation rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article 
                         6 H2020 General MGA).

                               eligible.  
                               PI employed/engaged by a third party — If the PI is employed/engaged by a third

                               candidates  (because  recruitment  is  part  of  the  activities  of  such  actions  —  unlike  for 
                               actions under the General MGA or ERC PoC actions).

                               and their necessity for the action is demonstrated.

                               emphasis  on  the  protection  of  inventions,  the  PIs  are  encouraged  to  protect  their 
                               intellectual  property  rights  properly.  Costs  related  to  protection  of  other  intellectual

                               maintenance of the research data generated by the action. With explicit agreement by the 
                               Agency, it can also include fees levied for a membership scheme (if this is a requirement 
                               for publishing with open access or if membership is a pre-condition for significantly lower

                         The rules on ineligible costs are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 6.5 H2020 General

                                       independently (i.e. in their own name) for further EU funding for other actions or for the same action, but 
                                       for costs that are not eligible (or not declared) under the ERC grant. 
                                                The fact that the funding rate for ERC grants is 100% does not mean that the grant pays for 100% of 
                                                the costs of the ERC action. Therefore cost items not declared under the ERC grant may be covered by 
                                                other EU funding.

                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                     -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11); 
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
                                     -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13); 
                                     -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14). 
                                     -        call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a). 
                           In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency and the other beneficiaries for 
                           implementing the action.

                                parties involved in the action 
                         For ERC actions, the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 8 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The  PI  must  in  principle,  be  hosted  and  engaged  by  the  principal  beneficiary.  However,  in 
                         exceptional cases, the PI can be engaged by a third party (e.g. a third party that makes the PI 
                         available to work in the host institution; see Articles 11 and 12). 
                                  Example: Research agencies that put the PIs at disposal of different universities.

                             18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support the costs declared 
                             The beneficiaries must keep the records and documentation supporting the costs declared, in particular the 
                             following: 
                                      (a)  for actual costs: adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the costs declared, 
                                              such as contracts, subcontracts, invoices and accounting records. In addition, the beneficiaries’ 
                                              usual cost accounting practices and internal control procedures must enable direct reconciliation 
                                              between the amounts declared, the amounts recorded in their accounts and the amounts stated in 
                                              the supporting documentation; 
                                      (b)  for unit costs: adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the number of units 
                                              declared. Beneficiaries  do not  need  to  identify  the  actual  eligible  costs  covered  or  to  keep  or 
                                              provide supporting documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount per unit.     
                                              In addition, for unit costs calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting 
                                              practices, the beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation to prove that the cost 
                                              accounting practices used comply with the conditions set out in Article 6.2. 
                                              The  beneficiaries  [and  linked  third  parties]  may  submit  to  the  Commission,  for  approval,  a 
                                              certificate (drawn up in accordance with Annex 6) stating that their usual cost accounting practices 
                                              comply with these conditions (‘certificate on the methodology’). If the certificate is approved, 
                                              costs  declared  in  line  with  this  methodology  will  not  be  challenged  subsequently,  unless  the 
                                              beneficiaries have concealed information for the purpose of the approval. 
                                      (c)  for flat-rate costs: adequate records and other supporting documentation to prove the eligibility of 
                                              the  costs  to  which  the  flat-rate  is  applied.  The  beneficiaries  do  not  need  to  identify  the  costs 
                                              covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount 
                                              declared at a flat-rate. 
                             In addition, for personnel costs (declared as actual costs or on the basis of unit costs), the beneficiaries 
                             must keep time records for the number of hours declared. The time records must be in writing and 
                             approved by the persons working on the action and their supervisors, at least monthly. In the absence of 
                             reliable  time  records  of  the  hours  worked  on  the  action,  the  Agency  may  accept  alternative  evidence 
                             supporting the number of hours declared, if it considers that it offers an adequate level of assurance.  
                             As an exception, for persons working exclusively on the action, there is no need to keep time records, if 
                             the beneficiary signs a declaration confirming that the persons concerned have worked exclusively on the 
                             action.

                                     -        ‘final scientific report’ within 60 days after the end of the last reporting period. 
                           The periodic scientific report must include: 
                                     (a)  information about the scientific progress of the work; 
                                     (b)  achievements and results of the action, such as publications and a declaration of any major

                                     (c)  information on whether and how open access has been provided to these results (see Article 29); 
                                     (d)  a summary of the achievements of the action for publication by the Agency. 
                            The final scientific report must: 
                                     (a)  present the final results, achievements and conclusions of the action, and how they have been 
                                              disseminated (including via scientific publications) (see Article 29); 
                                     (b)  contain a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the Agency.

                            The action is divided into the following ‘financial reporting periods’: 
                                     -        FRP1: from month 1 to month [X] 
                                     -        [- FRP2: from month [X+1] to month[ Y] 
                                     -        FRP3: from month [Y+1] to month [Z] 
                                     -        [same for other FRPs] 
                                     -        final FRP: from month [N+1] to [the last month of the project].] 
                            The beneficiary must— within 60 days after the end of each period — submit to the Agency a ‘financial 
                            report’ for each reporting period.

              The financial report must contain: 
                 (a)  information on the eligible costs, including a ‘breakdown of direct costs table’ and a ‘budget 
                     follow-up table’; 
                 (b)  an ‘individual financial statement’ (see Annex 4) from the beneficiary [and from each linked 
                     third party] for the reporting period concerned. 
                     The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs and flat-rate 
                     costs; see Article 6) for each budget category (see Annex 2). 
                     The beneficiary [and linked third parties] must declare all eligible costs, even if — for actual costs, 
                     unit costs and flat-rate costs — they exceed the amounts indicated in the estimated budget (see 
                     Annex 2). Amounts which are not declared in a financial statement will not be taken into account 
                     by the Agency. If an individual financial statement is not submitted for a reporting period, it may 
                     be included in the periodic financial report for the next reporting period. 
                     The final financial statements must also detail the receipts of the action (see Article 5.3.3). 
                     The beneficiary [and each linked third party] must certify that: 
                         -   the information provided is full, reliable and true; 
                         -   the costs declared are eligible (see Article 6); 
                         -   the  costs  can  be  substantiated  by  adequate  records  and  supporting  documentation  (see 
                             Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, 
                             audits and investigations (see Article 22), and 
                         -   for the last reporting period: that all the receipts have been declared (see Article 5.3.3);

                     consolidating the individual financial statements for the reporting period concerned and including 
                     the request for interim payment (or — for the last financial reporting period — the request for 
                     payment of the balance);

                     5) for the beneficiary [and linked third party], if it requests a total contribution of EUR 325 000 or 
                     more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the basis of its usual cost 
                     accounting practices (see Article 5.2 and Article 6.2.

             Financial statements must be drafted in euro. 
             Beneficiaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in a currency other than the euro must 
             convert the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in 
             the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, calculated over the corresponding reporting 
             period.

              20.5   Language of reports 
              All  reports  (scientific  and  financial  reports,  including  financial  statements)  must  be  submitted  in  the 
              language of the Agreement. 
              20.6   Consequences of non-compliance  
              If the reports submitted do not comply with this Article, the Agency may suspend the payment deadline (see 
             Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
              If the principal beneficiary breaches its obligation to submit the reports and if it fails to comply with this 
              obligation within 30 days following a written reminder, the Agency may terminate the Agreement (see 
             Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
             
              
             
                       
                       
            1. Reports 
            What & When? For ERC actions, the principal beneficiary must submit both: 
                   a periodic scientific report after the end of each scientific reporting period (except the 
                    last one), with: 
                           information about the scientific progress of the work 
                           the achievements and results of the action, such as publications and a declaration 
                            of any major change of scientific strategy 
                           information on whether and how open access has been provided to these results 
                            (see Article 29) 
                           a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the Agency. 
                   a final scientific report at the end of the action, with: 
                           the final results, achievements and conclusions of the action, and how they have 
                            been disseminated (including via scientific publications) (see Article 29) 
                           a summary of the achievements of the action, for publication by the Agency. 
                Example: For a five-year grant, there are two scientific reporting periods, so a ‘periodic scientific report’ is due 
                for months 1-30 and a ‘final scientific report’ for months 31-60. 
            In addition, the principal beneficiary must submit a financial report at the end of each financial 
            reporting period, with: 
                   a narrative containing information on the eligible costs, including a breakdown of direct 
                    costs table and a budget follow-up table 
                   an individual financial statement 
                   a summary financial statement, created automatically by the IT system (on the basis of all 
                    financial  statements  submitted  by  the  beneficiaries  and  linked  third  parties  for  the 
                    reporting period), which counts as the request of payment 
                   for the last financial reporting period only: a certificate on the financial statements (CFS). 
                Example: For a five-year grant, there are four financial reporting periods, so a financial report is due for months 
                1-18, 19-36, 37-54 and 55-60.

            How? All reports must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal, see 
            Article 20 H2020 General MGA). 
             
            2. Reporting periods 
            Like for the General MGA, ERC actions are divided into reporting periods.  
            The ERC MGA has, however, different reporting periods for financial and scientific reports. 
            Their length is defined in the signed GA. Normally, the financial reporting period is 18 months, 
            whereas scientific reports are due halfway through and at the end of the project. 
                Example: For a five-year grant, there are four financial reporting periods (months 1-18, 19-36, 37-54 and 55-
                60) and two scientific reporting periods (months 1-30 and 31-60). 
            Reports must be submitted within 60 days after each period ends.

                           26.3               Rights of third parties (including personnel and the principal investigator[s])  
                           If third parties (including personnel and the principal investigator[s]) may claim rights to the results, the 
                           beneficiary concerned must ensure that it complies with its obligations under the Agreement. 
                           If a third party generates results for a beneficiary, the beneficiary concerned must obtain all necessary 
                              rights (transfer, licences or other) from the third party, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if 
                           those results were generated by the beneficiary itself. 
                           If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using the third party to generate the 
                           results.

                         1. Third parties with rights on results 
                         For ERC actions, the same rules on third party rights apply as in the General MGA (see Article 26 
                         H2020 General MGA). 
                         Due to the key role of the PI, it is however particularly important that agreements between the 
                         host institution and the PI allow the host institution to comply with its obligations under the GA — 
                         either  by  foreseeing  a  transfer  of  ownership  to  the  host  institution  or  by  providing  it  with 
                         appropriate access rights (with a right to sub-license).

                                              Moreover, the beneficiary must aim to deposit at the same time the research data needed to validate 
                                              the results presented in the deposited scientific publications.

                            [OPTION 1 for actions participating in the Open Research Data Pilot (in line with the provisions in the  
                            ERC  work  programme):  Regarding  the  digital  research  data  generated  in  the  action  (‘data’),  the

                                     (a)  deposit in a research data repository and take measures to make it possible for third parties to 
                                              access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate — free of charge for any user — the following: 
                                                       (i)  the  data,  including  associated  metadata,  needed  to  validate  the  results  presented  in 
                                                                scientific publications as soon as possible; 
                                                       (ii)  other data, including associated metadata, as specified in the data management plan; 
                                     (b)  provide information — via the repository — about tools and instruments at the disposal of the 
                                              beneficiaries and necessary for validating the results (and  — where possible — provide the tools 
                                              and instruments themselves). 
                            This does not change the obligation to protect results in Article 27, the confidentiality obligations in Article

                            which still apply. 
                            As an exception, the beneficiaries do not have to ensure open access to specific parts of their research data 
                            if the achievement of one of the action objectives, as described in Annex 1, would be jeopardised by making 
                            those specific parts of the research data openly accessible. In this case, the data management plan must 
                            contain the reasons for not giving access.]

                            1. Open access to scientific publications 
                            For ERC actions, the rules for open access to scientific publications are in principle the same as in 
                            the General MGA (see Article 29 H2020 General MGA). 
                            Beneficiaries  must  ensure  open,  free-of-charge  access  to  the  end-user  to  peer-reviewed 
                            scientific publications relating to their results. 
                                        ‘Peer-reviewed publications’ means publications that have been evaluated by other scholars.  
                                        Monographs,  book  chapters  and  other  long-text  publications  are  considered  to  be  peer-
                                        reviewed, if the following conditions are fulfilled: 
                                                      at least one independent expert (i.e. external to the publishing house) has reviewed the 
                                                       manuscript before acceptance for publication. For monographs in the strict sense (i.e. 
                                                       not edited collections), external review of a substantial part of the work is sufficient to 
                                                       be considered peer-reviewed 
                                                      the  external  reviewer  must  not  be  a  scientific  series  editor  or  a  commercial  editor 
                                                       related to the publication in question. For edited collections, it must not be the editor of 
                                                       the collection 
                                                      PhD theses and habilitations for professorial degrees are considered peer-reviewed if 
                                                       they are formally published (because the review by external experts is generally part of 
                                                       the  assessment  of  the  candidate's  research  work  for  the  PhD  degree  or  the  'venia 
                                                       legendi'). 
                             
                                                     Other  types  of  publications,  such  as  non-peer-reviewed  articles  as  well  as  non-peer  reviewed 
                                            monographs, books, conference proceedings and 'grey literature' (i.e. informally published material not 
                                            having gone through a standard publishing process, e.g. reports), are not covered by the open access 
                                            obligation. 
                                            Best practice: However, to ensure fuller and wider access, beneficiaries are encouraged to provide open 
                                            access also to these other types of scientific publications (where possible). 
                             
                            ERC grants have however the following specificities: 
                            The ERC Scientific Council recommends the use of subject-specific repositories: 
                                                         for           publications                           in           the             Life             Sciences                      domain:  Europe  PubMed  Central 
                                                          (http://europepmc.org) 
                                                         for           publications  in  the  Physical  Sciences  and  Engineering  domain:  arXiv 
                                                          (http://arxiv.org).  
                                      If  there  is  no  appropriate  discipline  specific  repository,  researchers  should  make  their 
                                      publications  available  in  institutional  repositories  or  in  centralized  ones,  such  as  Zenodo 
                                      (http://zenodo.org).  For  monographs,  book  chapters  and  other  long-text  publications,  the 
                                      recommended repository is the OAPEN Library (http://oapen.org). 
                            With explicit agreement by the Agency, the extended deadline for publications for grants in the 
                            social  sciences  and humanities domain (i.e. 12 months) can exceptionally be granted also for 
                            specific publications of grants in other domains, if the specific publication can be considered to 
                            relate to the social sciences and humanities. This must be requested within the 6 months originally 
                            foreseen.                                
                            Moreover, for publications after the end of the action, if beneficiaries cannot provide open access 
                            within the time limits set by Article 29.2 without incurring additional costs for gold open access,

                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                                           ERC 
                  they  may  choose  green  open  access  with  an  extended  embargo  period  which  goes  beyond 
                  six/twelve months.  
                  Finally, the ERC MGA foresees lighter requirements for bibliographic metadata, focusing only on a 
                  persistent  identifier  (i.e.  a  stable  address/marker  to  identify  the  publication,  such  as  a  digital 
                                                        75
                  object identifier (DOI)  or other systems). 
                       Best practice: If the repository allows for this, beneficiaries of ERC grants are strongly encouraged 
                       to ensure that the bibliographic metadata also includes additional information such as the European 
                       Research Council (ERC) as funding source, the grant number, the title of the action and its acronym, 
                       the publication date, and the length of the embargo period (if applicable). For ease of tracking, 
                       beneficiaries  should  include  the  digital  object  identifier  for  the  'European  Research  Council' 
                       (http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781)  in  the  funding  acknowledgement  field  in  their 
                       metadata,              in       addition            to       the         digital         object          identifier           for        'Horizon           2020' 
                       (http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601). 
                   
                          For more guidance, see Open Access on the ERC website, the ERCEA Implementation Guidelines and the ERC 
                     Scientific Council's Open Access Guidelines for research results funded by the ERC. 
                     
                  2. Open access to research data 
                  This option will be inserted in the GA for ERC frontier research actions that participate in the Open 
                  Research Data Pilot (in line with provisions in the ERC Work Programme). 
                  The rules on open access to research data are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                  Article 29 H2020 General MGA). 
                  The ERC MGA has however the following specificities: 
                  The data management plan (DMP) must address the following issues (the use of the ERC template 
                  is strongly recommended but not mandatory):  
                          1.  Making data Findable 
                          2.  Making data openly Accessible 
                          3.  Making data Interoperable 
                          4.  Increase data Re-use 
                          5.  Allocations of resources and data security 
                         Moreover the DMP can provide justification for NOT ensuring open access to specific parts of 
                         the research data. For ERC actions, the exception allowing beneficiaries not to give access to 
                         specific parts of their research data applies not only if this would jeopardise the main objective 
                         of the action, but any one of the action objectives.)  
                   
                                          For  ERC  frontier  research  actions,  the  main  objective  is  always  a  purely  scientific  one.  The 
                                    justification for non-disclosure therefore does NOT need to be the scientific objective of the action but 
                                    can refer to other objectives, such as the intended later commercialisation of the scientific findings.  
                                     
                         A first version of the data management plan must be submitted within the first 6 months of 
                         the project implementation and should then be updated during the lifetime of the project, as 
                         needed. 
                  The  beneficiaries  may  opt  out  of  the  pilot  at  any  stage  —  both  before  signing  the  GA  and 
                  afterwards (through an amendment; see Article 55 H2020 General MGA). No reasons have to be 
                  provided for opting out. By opting out, they free themselves retroactively from the obligations 
                  associated with taking part in the pilot.

                          28      Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for 
                                  the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p.67). 
                        
                                        
                       1. Working conditions — Rights for the PI and his/her team 
                       In view of the key role of the PI and his/her team in ERC actions, the ERC MGA foresees a series 
                       of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions and scientific autonomy for 
                       them.  
                               Main obligations (towards the PI): 
                                              Scientific autonomy, to achieve the action’s objectives under the best possible conditions, 
                                               and within the time agreed 
                                              Competitive working conditions, always in accordance with national law and institutional 
                                               rules 
                                              Support  for  managing  the  action  (e.g  access  to  infrastructure;  legal,  financial  and 
                                               administrative support) 
                                              Access to and protection of intellectual property rights 
                                              Allow and facilitate the transfer of the GA to another host institution (grant portability). 
                        
                       2. Supplementary agreement — Obligations on the PI  
                       The ERC MGA foresees that the PI and its host institution must sign a supplementary agreement 
                       (SA), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also towards the PI.  
                               Main obligations (of the PI): 
                                              Supervision of the scientific and technological implementation of the action 
                                              Responsibility for the scientific reporting and contribution to the financial reporting 
                                              Meeting the time commitments for implementing the action

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             ERC 
                        The PI must ensure a sufficient time commitment and presence throughout the course of 
                        the project to guarantee its proper execution. 
                        The two time commitment obligations are as follows: 
                               % of working time that the PI must work on the action 
                               % of  working  time  that  the  PI  must  work  in  an  EU  Member  State  or  H2020 
                                associated country. 
                        To be operational, these two percentages must be translated into working hours, i.e.: 
                               minimum number of hours that the PI must work in the action over its duration 
                               minimum number of hours that the PI must work in an EU Member State or H2020 
                                associated country over the duration of the action. 
                        The calculation should be done as follows: 
                            Step 1 — For each year of the action, the percentages of PI commitment are applied to: 
                                          a)  either the annual hours of a standard full time equivalent at the host 
                                              institution, or 
                                          b)  1720 annual hours (this option must be used in all cases when it is 
                                              not  possible  to  determine  the  number  of  hours  of  a  full  time 
                                              equivalent at the host institution). 
                                     The standard full time equivalent (or 1720 annual hours) works as a ceiling: 
                                     they apply even if the PI works in total more hours (i.e. has other parallel 
                                     affiliations, freelance activities or work-related obligations or works more hours 
                                     on the action). In this case, the time commitment is capped at 100% and the 
                                     hours  are  calculated  on  the  standard  full  time  equivalent  (or  1720  annual 
                                     hours). 
                                     By contrast, if the PI works in total less hours than the standard full time 
                                     equivalent (or 1720 annual hours), the time commitment obligation will be 
                                     reduced proportionally.  
                                        To do so, the percentage of PI commitment will be applied to the total work 
                                        of the PI (instead of to options a) or b) above).  
                                        The total work of the PI will be determined by adding up all her/his hours of 
                                        remunerated work, including under contracts with entities other than the 
                                        host institution.  
                                            Example: The % of PI commitment to the ERC action is 50%. The PI works 60 
                                            % part time at the host institution and has another contract with a different 
                                            entity  to  work  350  hours  over  the  year.  A  full  time  equivalent  at  the  host 
                                            institution works 1750 hours per year. The hours that the PI works in total are = 
                                            60 % of 1750 + 350 = 1 050 + 350 = 1 400. Since this amount is lower than the 
                                            full time equivalent, the time commitment obligation will be: 1 400 x 50 % = 700                                                                                            
                            Step 2 — Sum up the results for each year of Step 1 to get the total number of hours 
                                       over the action duration.  
                        The percentages must be reached for the overall action duration (NOT annually or per 
                        reporting period).  
                        The PI's time commitments obligations must be fulfilled even if no personnel costs are 
                        charged for him/her to the project.  
                       Applying the host institution’s usual management practices 
                       Informing the principal beneficiary immediately of any events or circumstances likely to 
                        affect the GA 
                       Ensure the visibility of EU funding

                       Upholding the intellectual property rights of the host institution  
                        This obligation is not limited to respecting the host institution’s intellectual property rights 
                        (IPRs). The PI must actively inform it if s/he becomes aware of any violations. 
                            Example: The PI reads a research article and discovers a violation of the host institution’s project 
                            IPRs. S/he is obliged to inform the host institution.  
                       Maintaining confidentiality. 
                The ‘supplementary agreement’ is an agreement between the host institution and the PI, to 
                set out their internal arrangements for implementing the grant.  
                    It is purely internal; the EU/Euratom is NOT party and has NO responsibility for it (nor 
                    for any adverse consequences). 
                    It  should  cover  all  the  practical  issues  that  may  arise  in  the  context  of  the  grant 
                    implementation (in particular the ones listed in Article 32.1(b)) and must remain in place 
                    at least for the action duration (see Article 3) (— without any interruptions, even if the PI 
                    works only part-time on the ERC project). 
                    It must NOT contain any provisions contrary to the GA. (Provisions that contradict the 
                    GA are considered void and cannot be opposed to the Agency.) 
                    It can NOT replace an employment or engagement contract between the PI and its host 
                    institution (which remain necessary under national labour and social laws).  
                    It must be concluded before GA signature (or in case of portability before submission of 
                    the amendment request) and a copy must be sent to the Agency. 
                    A template [ODT format] for a model supplementary agreement is available. (The model is 
                    not mandatory; beneficiaries may use other clauses, provided they benefit the research 
                    action and do not contradict the GA.) 
             
            Specific cases (supplementary agreement): 
            PI employed/engaged by a third party — The supplementary agreement must be signed by the PI, 
            the host institution and the third party. 
            Several PIs — For ERC Synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each host 
            institution must conclude a supplementary agreement with the PI(s) they engage. 
            No supplementary agreement — NO supplementary agreement is needed for ERC PoC grants. 
            PI entitled to sign the supplementary agreement — If the PI is entitled to sign the supplementary 
            agreement  on  behalf  of  the  host  institution  (because  of  his/her  position  in  the  institution),  the 
            supplementary agreement must be counter-signed by another person empowered by the institution. 
            The principal investigator can NOT sign his/her own supplementary agreement for both parties. 
            Grant portability — If the GA is transferred to another host institution  (see Article 56a), a new 
            supplementary agreement must be signed with the new host institution (and forwarded to the Agency). 
            The new agreement must take effect from the grant transfer date (or before). The GA cannot be 
            amended before the PI has sent the new supplementary agreement.

                                              For communication activities: “This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC)

                                              For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part

                           When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem and the ERC logo must have appropriate 
                           prominence.  
                           For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem and the 
                           ERC logo without first obtaining approval from the Agency. 
                           This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
                           Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem, the ERC logo or any similar trademark or logo, either 
                             by registration or by any other means.

                         1. Visibility of EU funding 
                         For ERC actions, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see 
                         Articles 27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA). 
                         In  addition,  the  beneficiaries  must  however  make  specific  reference  to  the  European 
                         Research Council (ERC). Thus, the clause acknowledging funding is slightly adapted and the 
                         beneficiaries must also use the ERC logo. 
                                                For more information on using the ERC logo, see the ERC home page

                           56.1               Accession of the beneficiaries mentioned in the Preamble 
                           The other beneficiaries must accede to the Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see Annex 3) in the 
                           electronic  exchange  system  (see  Article  52)  within  30  days  after  its  entry  into  force  (see  Article  58) 
                             [OPTION if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested: and, for beneficiaries for 
                           which the [Commission][Agency] has requested joint and several liability of a linked third party, by also 
                             submitting — at accession — a declaration on joint and several liability (see Annex 3a) signed by the third 
                           party]. 
                           They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of its entry into 
                           force (see Article 58). 
                           If a beneficiary does not accede to the Agreement within the above deadline, the principal beneficiary must 
                             —  within  30  days  —  request  an  amendment  to  make  any  changes  necessary  to  ensure  proper 
                           implementation of the action. This does not affect the Agency’s right to terminate the Agreement (see 
                             Article 50).  
                           56.2               Addition of new beneficiaries 
                           In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary. 
                           For this purpose, the principal beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 
                           55.  It  must  include  an  Accession  Form  (see  Annex  3)  signed  by  the  new  beneficiary  in  the  electronic 
                             exchange system (see Article 52).  
                           New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
                           their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                           MONO-BENEFICIARY: ARTICLE 56 — ACCESSION TO THE AGREEMENT 
                           56.1               Addition of new beneficiaries 
                           In justified cases, the beneficiary may request the addition of a new beneficiary. 
                           For this purpose, the beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 55. It 
                             must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic exchange 
                           system (see Article 52).  
                           New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
                             their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                           If a new beneficiary is added, the grant becomes a multi-beneficiary grant and [OPTION 1: the preamble 
                           and  the  following  Articles  of  the  ERC  Multi-beneficiary  Model  Grant  Agreement  will  apply:

                         1. Addition of new beneficiaries 
                         For ERC actions, the rules on addition of beneficiaries are in principle the same as in the General 
                         MGA (see Article 56 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, unlike the General MGA, ERC mono-beneficiary grants can become multi-beneficiary 
                         grants, by addition of a new beneficiary according to this provision.

                                                                             PORTABILITY OF THE GRANT 
                           56a.1   Conditions 
                           [The][A] principal  investigator  may  request  the  transfer  of  the  action  (or  his/her  part  of  it)  to  a  new 
                             beneficiary, provided that the objectives of the action remain achievable. 
                           The  principal  beneficiary  [OPTION  for  SyG  and  other  ERC  grants  with  more  than  one  principal 
                           investigator: or, where applicable, his/her beneficiary] may object only on the basis that the transfer is not 
                           possible under national law. 
                           56a.2   Procedure 
                           The principal beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment to the Agency (see Article 55). 
                           56a.3   Effects 
                           The former beneficiary must agree with the principal investigator and the new beneficiary on a plan to 
                             transfer the intellectual property rights under the Agreement to the new beneficiary 
                           The Agency will request the former beneficiary to transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-
                           financing (see Article 21) not covered by an approved financial report. 
                           If requested by the principal investigator, the Agency may require the former beneficiary to transfer to the 
                             new beneficiary the equipment purchased and used exclusively for the action (against reimbursement of the 
                           costs that have not yet been depreciated). The former beneficiary may object only on the basis that the 
                           transfer is not possible under national law. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Transfer of the GA (portability)  
                         ERC grants can be transferred to a new host institution (‘new beneficiary’) — at any time during 
                         the action.  
                                   
                                             Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the host institution to a new 
                                       host institution — without passing via termination (Article 50) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 56). 
                                       NO  transfer  before  the  amendment  has  been  accepted  by  the  Agency.  Transfers  without  a  formal 
                                       amendment  are  void  and  may  result  in  GA  termination.  The  former  host  institution  remains  fully 
                                       responsible until the Agency has approved the amendment. 
                                   
                         The transfer may be based on any ground that is beneficial for the PI and supports achieving the 
                         action’s objectives. 
                         The former host institution (‘former beneficiary’) may oppose a transfer only if it is not allowed 
                         under national law. It may however negotiate transfer conditions (including transfer of team 
                         members, intellectual property rights and equipment) with the new host institution, taking into 
                         account the views of the PI.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             ERC 
            2. Procedure 
            The PI should first contact the host institution that signed the GA (i.e. the former host institution).  
                     Record-keeping  
                  Best practice: Beneficiaries and PIs should keep records of the consultation and decision-making process 
                  for each portability case. 
                   
                      . 
            The former host institution must submit a request for amendment to the Agency. 
                       
            For the amendment the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA). 
                   
            The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA. 
                   
                The date must be selected in the amendment request. If the new host institution joins the 
                action, the transfer date must be the same date as the accession date. Retroactive dates are 
                   
                allowed, but only in exceptional cases and with a specific justification (see Article 55 H2020 
                   
                General MGA).  
                   
            The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
            rights and obligations under the GA) of the new host institution (signed directly in the Funding & 
            Tenders Portal), the PI's justification letter and a supplementary agreement signed between the 
            new host institution and the PI  
            The financial reporting periods will be automatically adapted to match the transfer date (unless 
            the transfer date coincides with the end of a financial reporting period). Scientific reporting 
            periods will usually remain unchanged (since the transfer normally has no effect on the scientific 
            implementation of the action).  
                  For more guidance on amendments, see the Guide on amendment types & supporting documents and the 
              Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.   
                
                 
            3. Effects 
            The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from either the transfer date or the date of 
            signature of the amendment, whichever is the latest — submit: 
                       a financial report to the Agency (for the open period until transfer) 
                       a report on the distribution of payments (only in case of multi-beneficiary GA) 
                       if  the  costs  reach the threshold set out in Article 20:, a certificate on the financial 
                        statement (CFS) (— even if this is not the last reporting period). 
            These documents will be used for calculating the interim payment due to the former beneficiary. 
            The  Agency  will  moreover  instruct  the  former  host  institution  to  transfer  the  remaining  pre-
            financing to the new host institution. 
            If the PI requests it, the Agency may require the former host institution to transfer equipment 
            that was purchased and used exclusively for the action.  
                The former host institution may oppose this only if it is not possible under national law. It may 
                however negotiate transfer conditions with the new host institution, taking into account the 
                views of the PI.  
                Thus, the new host institution should make its best effort to buy the equipment fully used for 
                the project. If it  does so,  it  may  declare  the  costs  of  this  reimbursement  (and  any  other 
                related costs, i.e. dismantling, transfer and installation), if they fulfil the eligibility conditions 
                set out in Article 6.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             ERC 
                 
            Specific cases (portability): 
            Several PIs— In ERC synergy grants (i.e. ERC frontier research grants with several PIs), each PI has 
            the right to transfer his/her part of the action. They must inform and consult the other PIs, to ensure 
            that the action’s objectives can still be achieved. 
            Former host institution remains beneficiary — If certain team members (or equipment) stay with 
            the former host institution, while the PI moves to a new host institution, the GA is transferred and 
            changed into a multi-beneficiary grant agreement (allowing both the former host institution and the 
            new host institution to participate in the grant). The former host institution stays on as beneficiary, the 
            organisation that hosts and engages the PI is the new host institution. If the former host institution 
            remains only for a limited time (e.g. to ensure a smooth handover), it can then be terminated at a later 
            stage, via a beneficiary termination (see Article 50.2 H2020 General MGA).

                         II.3 H2020 ERC PoC MGA: Annotations 
                         The H2020 ERC PoC MGA is very similar to the H2020 ERC MGA.  
                         Like the ERC frontier research grants, the ERC PoC grants have a principal beneficiary (who is also 
                         the host institution) and a principal investigator.  
                         There are however NO specific provisions on the working conditions of the PI and his/her team 
                         (Article 32 H2020 ERC MGA), no supplementary agreement and no grant portability (Article 56a 
                         H2020 ERC MGA). 
                         The following annotations will only highlight the biggest differences. For the rest, the annotations 
                         to the ERC MGA apply mutatis mutandis.

                           ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
                           The grant is awarded for the action entitled [insert title of the action] — [insert acronym] (‘action’), as 
                           described in Annex 1. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. ERC PoC actions 
                         What? ERC PoC funds: 
                                          a  ‘proof  of  concept’  to  verify  the  innovation  potential  of  an  idea  from  an  ERC  frontier 
                                           research project.  
                         ERC PoC grants can cover any activities that develop research output towards new commercial or 
                         societal  applications  (e.g.  making  a  ‘business  plan’,  technical  issues  and  overall  direction, 
                         intellectual property rights positioning and strategy, budgeting and other commercial parameters; 
                         connections to later stage funding; establishing a company; demonstration, testing, prototyping, 
                         piloting, design). 
                         ERC PoC grants can NOT cover activities under the ERC frontier research grant (e.g. dissemination 
                         or  publications  of  the  results  of  the  ERC  frontier  research  action;  pure  research,  especially 
                         research with no commercial potential) or activities which are the result of research not performed 
                         under the ERC actions (e.g. results of research not funded by the ERC action).  
                         ERC PoC actions are normally mono-beneficiary actions, but can also be multi-beneficiary. 
                         ERC actions are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘European Research Council’ (e.g. ERC-
                         2015-PoC).

                                              The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs, flat-rate 
                                              costs; see Article 6) for each budget category (see Annex 2). 
                                              The beneficiaries [and linked third parties] must declare all eligible costs, even if — for actual 
                                              costs, unit costs and flat-rate costs — they exceed the amounts indicated in the estimated budget 
                                              (see Annex 2). Amounts which are not declared in the individual financial statement will not be 
                                              taken into account by the Agency. 
                                              The individual financial statements must also detail the receipts of the action (see Article 5.3.3).

                                                    -        the  costs  can  be  substantiated  by  adequate  records  and  supporting  documentation  (see

              20.3    Reports — Requests for interim payments and payment of balance 
              The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days following the end of each reporting period — submit a 
              report to the Agency.  
              The report must include the following:

                      The individual financial statement must detail the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs and flat-
                      rate costs; see Article 6) for each budget category (see Annex 2). 
                      The beneficiaries [and linked third parties] must declare all eligible costs, even if — for actual

                      (see Annex 2). Amounts which are not declared in the individual financial statement will not be 
                      taken into account by the Agency. 
                      If an individual financial statement is not submitted for a reporting period, it may be included in

                             000 or more, as reimbursement of actual costs and unit costs calculated on the basis of its 
                             usual cost accounting practices (see Article 5.2 and Article 6.2).] 
             20.4    Currency for financial statements and conversion into euro

             convert the costs recorded in their accounts into euro, at the average of the daily exchange rates published in 
             the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, calculated over the corresponding reporting 
             period.  
             If no daily euro exchange rate is published in the Official Journal of the European Union for the currency in 
             question,  they  must  be  converted  at  the  average  of  the  monthly  accounting  rates  published  on  the 
             Commission’s website, calculated over the corresponding reporting period.  
             Beneficiaries [and linked third parties] with accounting established in euro must convert costs incurred in 
             another currency into euro according to their usual accounting practices. 
             20.5    Language of reports 
             The report(s) (including financial statements) must be submitted in the language of the Agreement. 
             20.6    Consequences of non-compliance  
             If  the  report(s)  submitted  do  not  comply  with  this  Article,  the  Agency  may  suspend  the  deadline  for 
             payment (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
             If the principal beneficiary breaches its obligation to submit report(s) and if it fails to comply with this 
             obligation within 30 days following a written reminder, the Agency may terminate the Agreement (see 
             Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

            1. Reports 
            What & When? For ERC PoC actions, the principal beneficiary must submit periodic reports — 
            only one if there is one reporting period, otherwise one at the end of each reporting period. 
            The report(s) must include the all of the following: 
                   a summary for publication by the Agency 
                    The summary is a brief description of the action, presenting its objectives and the results 
                    achieved. It must be easy to read and understandable to a non-specialised audience. This 
                    will enable the Agency to publish it on the Commission’s website right away. 
                    The principal beneficiary must ensure that material submitted to the Agency for publication 
                    does not include any confidential material.  
                   an overview of progress towards the action’s objectives (or an overview of the action’s 
                    results for the last reporting period) 
                   information on the eligible costs, including a table showing the breakdown of direct costs 
                    and a budget follow-up table  
                   an individual financial statement. 
            In  addition,  a  summary financial statement, which counts as the request of payment, will be 
            created automatically by the IT system, on the basis of all financial statements submitted by the 
            beneficiaries and linked third parties for each reporting period. 
            Moreover, for the last reporting period, a certificate on the financial statements (CFS) will have to 
            be added (if necessary). 
            How? All reports must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal (see 
            Article 20 H2020 General MGA). 
             
            2. Reporting period(s) 
            ERC PoC actions normally have only one reporting period (with one pre-financing payment; see 
            Article 21). 
            As  a  general  rule,  this  single  reporting  period  lasts  18  months  (and  thus  the  entire  action 
            duration). 
            If provided in the GA, an ERC PoC action may however also have more reporting periods.

                         II.4 H2020 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA: Annotations 
                         Like the H2020 ERC PoC MGA, the H2020 ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA is very similar to the 
                         H2020 ERC MGA.  
                         As  the  ERC  frontier  research  grants,  the  ERC  PoC  Lump  Sum  Pilot  grants  have  a  principal 
                         beneficiary (who is also the host institution) and a principal investigator.  
                         There are however NO specific provisions on the working conditions of the PI and his/her team, 
                         and there is no supplementary agreement  (Article 32 H2020 ERC MGA). Furthermore, there is no 
                         right  of  the  PI  to  portability  of  the  grant  (Article  56a  H2020  ERC  MGA)  (although  for  mono-
                         beneficiary grants there is the possibility, in duly justified cases, to transfer the grant to a new 
                         beneficiary; see Article 56.3). 
                         Also, under the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA the grant payment is based on pre-fixed lump sum 
                         amount and not on actual costs reimbursement.  
                         The following annotations will only highlight the biggest differences. For the rest, the annotations 
                         to the ERC MGA apply mutatis mutandis.

                         ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants can cover any activities that develop research output towards new 
                         commercial or societal applications (e.g. making a ‘business plan’, technical issues and overall 
                         direction, intellectual property rights positioning and strategy, budgeting and other commercial

                         prototyping, piloting, design). 
                         ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants can NOT cover activities under the ERC frontier research grant

                         research, especially research with no commercial potential) or activities which are the result of 
                         research not performed under the ERC actions (e.g. results of research not funded by the ERC 
                         action).  
                         ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions are normally mono-beneficiary actions, but can also be multi-
                         beneficiary. 
                         ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘European Research 
                         Council’ (e.g. ERC-2019-PoC).

                                                                        TRANSFERS  
                              4.1 Estimated lump sum breakdown  
                              The ‘estimated lump sum breakdown’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
                              It contains the lump sum shares for the work per beneficiary [and linked third party].  
                              The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
                              beneficiaries. It shows the amounts that the Agency commits to pay if the action is implemented properly, 
                              regardless of the costs actually incurred. 
                              4.2 Lump sum share transfers  
                              The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 can be adjusted by transfers of amounts between the 
                              beneficiaries, but only via an amendment (see Article 55). 
                               
                                            
                         1. Estimated lump sum breakdown 
                         Differently from the ERC frontier research grants and the standard ERC PoC, the ERC PoC Lump 
                         Sum Pilot grants do not have any budget categories. Instead, they have a lump sum (for multi-
                         beneficiary grants, broken down per beneficiary).  
                         For multi-beneficiary grants, the breakdown is used to determine: 
                                          the share of the lump sum to which each beneficiary is entitled for the work  
                                          the  maximum  amount  for  which  each  beneficiary  is  liable  in  case  of  improper 
                                           implementation of the work.  
                                           Example: On a grant involving three beneficiaries, the Agency carries out a review after the payment of the 
                                           balance. The review concludes that 50% of the work attributed to beneficiary A was not implemented as 
                                           indicated in Annex 1. On those grounds, the Agency decides to reduce the grant. According to Annex 2, EUR 
                                           50 000 was allocated to beneficiary A. Therefore, beneficiary A will be liable in proportion to its tasks or 
                                           parts of the action not implemented (i.e. in case of a 50% reduction, beneficiary A will be liable for EUR 25 
                                           000).   
                                            
                         2. Lump sum share transfers 
                         Unlike in the General MGA, transfers of ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot shares are only possible via a 
                         formal amendment (i.e. increasing the share of a beneficiary and decreasing the share of another 
                         under a multi-beneficiary action).

                            ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
                            5.1               Maximum grant amount  
                            The ‘maximum grant amount’ is EUR 150.000 (one hundred and fifty thousand euros). 
                            5.2               Form of grant 
                            The grant takes the form of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Grant amount and form of grant  
                         How much & which form? The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not use the cost forms of 
                         the General MGA, but is a lump sum grant (see Decision C(2018) 5960). 
                                  The use of the lump sum will be set out in the ERC Work Programme.  
                                  The lump sum is a fixed amount of EUR 150 000 for each grant. This amount takes already 
                                  into account the H2020 ERC funding rate.  
                         There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is correctly implemented (in line with the 
                         description in Annex 1), the beneficiaries are entitled to receive the fixed lump sum amount.  
                          
                                      The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs for the action and it can NOT be 
                               increased.

            5.3     Final grant amount — Calculation 
            The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance with 
            the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
            This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in the 
            following steps: 
                Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum for the approved work and reduction for non-approved work  
                Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
            5.3.1    Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum for the approved work and reduction for non-approved 
                     work  
            The amount of the lump sum corresponds to the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) declared by the beneficiaries 
            [and linked third parties] for the approved work in the financial statement at the payment of the balance (see 
            Article 20.4). 
            The grant is reduced (see Article 43) for the part of the work that has not been delivered or cannot be approved 
            at the payment of the balance).  
            5.3.2    Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                     obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
            If the grant is further reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
            other than improper implementation; see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by 
            deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
            fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant amount set out in 
            Article 5.1. 
            The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                –   the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
                –   the reduced grant amount following Step 2.  
              
             
                     
             1. Final grant amount 
             For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same 
             as for the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
             However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21). 
             Moreover, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared cannot be higher than the 
             amount fixed in Annex 2 anyways), there is NO need to calculate the: 
                 ­  limit to the maximum grant amount or  
                 ­  reduction due to the no-profit rule.

              5.4     Revised final grant amount — Calculation 
              If  — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
              Article 22) — the Agency reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
              breach of obligations including improper implementation; see Article 43), it will calculate the ‘revised final 
              grant amount’ for the beneficiary concerned by the findings. 
              This amount is calculated by the Agency by calculating the concerned beneficiary’s share in the grant 
              amount reduced in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations 
              (see Article 43.2). 
               
               
               
                     
            1. Revised final grant amount 
            For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the revised final grant amount are in principle 
            the same as for the General MGA (see Article 5.4 H2020 General MGA). 
            However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21).

                              ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                            IN THE ACTION 
                              The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                              If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                       -        purchase goods, works and services; 
                                       -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment; 
                                       -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge; 
                                       -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1; 
                                       -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1; 
                                       -        call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1  
                              in accordance with the specific rules set out in Article 10 to 14a. 
                              In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency and the other beneficiaries for 
                              implementing the action. 
                                            
                               
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Third parties involved in the action 
                         The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable to the ERC PoC 
                         Lump Sum Pilot MGA. 
                         The General MGA rules on third party involvement are limited in PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions to 
                         subcontracting (Article 13) and linked third parties (Article 14).  
                         The articles  for  purchases  (Article  10)  and  in-kind  contributions  (Articles  11  and  12)  are  not 
                         applicable to the PoC Lump Sum MGA. Beneficiaries may make purchases and use any in-kind 
                         contributions from third parties following their internal practices but not subject to other rules (as 
                         long as they are needed to carry out the work of the action).

                         ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                            ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                            13.1              Specific rules for subcontracting action tasks 
                            Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action. 
                            The tasks to be implemented for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1. The Agency may however 
                            approve subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55), if: 
                                     -        they are specifically justified in the final report and 
                                     -        they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
                                              the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                            [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
                            only after explicit approval (in writing) from the Agency (see Article 37).] 
                            The beneficiaries must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
                            their subcontractors. 
                            The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
                            subcontractors. 
                            13.2              Consequences of non-compliance 
                            If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                            Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                             
                                            
                         1. Subcontracting 
                         The rules on subcontracting for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle the same as for 
                         the General MGA (see Articles 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA has however the following specificities: 
                         The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT need to be included in Annex 1 or shown in the table 
                         of estimated costs in Annex 2 (there is no such table for the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot; Annex 2 is 
                         not the budget, but the estimated lump sum for mono-beneficiary grants/lump sum breakdown for 
                         multi-beneficiary grants). By contrast, the tasks to be subcontracted must still be indicated in 
                         Annex 1, as it happens in the General MGA. 
                         The principles of best value for money and no conflict of interest are not explicitly mentioned in 
                         Article 13. Nonetheless, they must still be complied with and confirmed by the beneficiaries at 
                         proposal stage. 
                         The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
                         ‘other obligations’. In case of breach, the Agency may therefore reduce the grant in proportion to 
                         the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs). 
                         The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations which occurred at proposal stage (see 
                         Article 43 H2020 General MGA).

                             ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION 
                             18.1              Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation 
                             The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default: five][OPTION 2 for low value grants: 
                             three]  years  after  the  payment  of  the  balance  —  keep  adequate  records  and  other  supporting 
                             documentation to prove the proper implementation of the action. 
                             They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                             investigations (see Article 22).  
                             If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                             Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
                             other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures. 
                             The beneficiaries  must  keep  the  original  documents.  Digital  and  digitalised  documents  are  considered 
                             originals  if  they  are  authorised  by  the  applicable  national  law.  The  Agency  may  accept  non-original 
                             documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance 
                             Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation of the action 
                             must be in line with the accepted standards in the respective field. 
                             The beneficiaries do not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the action. 
                             18.2              Consequences of non-compliance 
                             If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                             Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                              
                                            
                         1. Records and other supporting documentation  
                         For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep records on their actual 
                         costs; they only need to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation, records) that 
                         the action tasks (as described in Annex 1) were properly carried out.  
                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. It must be correctly archived — for at 
                         least 5 years after the balance is paid or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, 
                         investigations or litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until the end of the respective 
                         procedure. 
                         The records and supporting documentation must: 
                                          refer  to  the  implementation  of  the  action,  in  line  with  the  accepted  standards  in  the 
                                           respective field (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA) and 
                                            
                                          prove that the tasks or part of the action allocated to the beneficiary in Annex 1 were 
                                           implemented properly (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA).  
                         By contrast, timesheets or invoices for costs actually incurred are NOT needed.  
                            If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
                      reduced (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

                                                with Annex 1 and that actually carried out.

                                       (d)   an ‘individual financial statement’ (see Annex 4) from each beneficiary [and each linked third 
                                                party], for the reporting period.  
                                                         The individual financial statement must declare the lump sum share indicated in Annex 2, for 
                                                         the work that was completed in the reporting period.

              If the final report submitted does not comply with this Article, the Agency may suspend the payment 
              deadline (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
              If the principal beneficiary breaches its obligation to submit the report and if it fails to comply with this 
              obligation within 30 days following a written reminder, the Agency may terminate the Agreement (see 
              Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
               
                     
            1. Reports 
            What & When? For ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions, the principal beneficiary must submit a 
            final report at the end of the action. 
            The report must include the following: 
                   a summary for publication by the Agency 
                    The summary is a brief description of the action, presenting its objectives and the results 
                    achieved. It must be fit for publication and written in an easy to read language for a non-
                    specialised audience. This will enable the Agency to publish it on the Commission’s website 
                    right away. 
                    The principal beneficiary must ensure that material submitted to the Agency for publication 
                    does not include any confidential material.  
                   an overview of the results towards the action’s objectives  
                   an individual financial statement. 
            The  final  report  includes  the  completed  work  and  the  corresponding  lump  sum  shares  per 
            beneficiary.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019      ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
            In principle, lump sum shares should be claimed only for work fully accomplished as described in 
            Annex 1. However, if agreed by the Agency, the beneficiary may exceptionally declare partial lump 
            sum shares for work not completed, for example, due to technical reasons.   
            Best  practice:  In  case  of  doubt,  the  beneficiary  should  contact  the  Agency  about  work  partially 
            accomplished.  
                 The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if: 
                     the situation could have been solved via an amendment.  
                       Example: The beneficiary argues that a new research methodology made the planned methodology 
                       obsolete. The new methodology could have been accepted via an amendment. 
                     non-implementation linked to financial reasons 
                       Example: The in-depth market study turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
                       beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned. 
               
               
            How?  The  final  report  must  be  prepared  by  the  principal  beneficiary  and  the  other 
            beneficiaries together, directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal). 
            In practice, the following steps will apply: 
                Step 1 — The principal beneficiary will indicate in the Funding & Tenders Portal if the work 
                foreseen in Annex 1 has been fully accomplished during the action duration.   
                Step 2 — The beneficiaries will have to sign individual financial statements to confirm proper 
                implementation of their parts of the work and submit them to the principal beneficiary. All of 
                them will be part of the final report.  
                Step 3 — The principal beneficiary will submit the final report to the Agency.

                             The following payments will be made to the principal beneficiary: 
                                      -        one pre-financing payment; 
                                      -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
                                               20). 
                             21.2 Pre-financing payment — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
                             The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
                             It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
                             The amount of the pre-financing payment will be EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)].  
                             The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre-financing payment to the principal 
                             beneficiary within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 
                             days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest. 
                             An amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
                             amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency from the pre-financing payment and transferred into the 
                             ‘Guarantee Fund’.  
                             [OPTION if the JRC is a beneficiary: Moreover, the part of the pre-financing payment related to the Joint

                             but kept by the Agency for the JRC.] 
                             21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
                             Not applicable  
                             21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
                             Guarantee Fund 
                             The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the lump sum for the implementation of the 
                             action. 
                             If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
                             of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
                             If  the  total  amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency will pay the 
                             balance within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                             Payment is subject to the approval of the final report and the lump sum shares for the work declared. Their 
                             approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of their 
                             content. 
                             The part of the work that has not been delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance will 
                             reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019      ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
              The amount due as the balance is calculated by the Agency by deducting the total amount of pre-
              financing already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
                      {final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
                      minus  
                      pre-financing made}.  
              At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
              and: 
                  -   if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the beneficiary together with 
                      the amount due as the balance; 
                  -   if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
                      from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
                         -   is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary  
                         -   is negative, it will be recovered.  
              The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any other 
              amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the 
              EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated 
              lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2). 
               
                     
            1. Payments to be made 
            ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot actions have only one reporting period (see Article 20.2), with one pre-
            financing payment. 
            There are NO interim payments. 
            The balance is paid on approval of the final report. 
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries  
            Beneficiary termination 
            How much? The amount due at beneficiary termination will be calculated by the Agency on the 
            basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the report on the distribution of 
            payments. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 21.3, 44.1.1, 50.2.2 and 50.3.3 H2020 
            General MGA), however with the following specificities: 
            Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
            eligible costs, but simply takes into account the lump sum share for the beneficiary’s accepted 
            work.  
            Exceptionally,  the  Commission/Agency  may  accept  also  part  of  a  lump  sum  share  for  work 
            partially accomplished by the beneficiary.  
             
            ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21                                           427 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019      ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
            Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination: 
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C). 
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 150 000. 
            Lump sum share breakdown per beneficiary (Annex 2): 
                                       Lump sum shares for the    Total EU contribution 
                                                work  
                     Beneficiary A              50 000                   50 000 
                     Beneficiary B              70 000                   70 000 
                     Beneficiary C              30 000                       
                                                                         30 000 
                         Total                 150 000                  150 000 
             
                The participation of beneficiary B is terminated before the end of the project. The reason for terminating its 
                participation is the non-availability anymore of a biosafety level 4 laboratory which has been damaged by a fire 
                during the course of the action and where proof of concept activities for the second virus should have been also 
                performed. Therefore, this beneficiary cannot complete its tasks due to force majeure (see Article 51 H2020 
                General MGA). On those grounds, the Agency decides to accept for that beneficiary a part of the lump sum 
                shares proportionate to the tasks carried out by the beneficiary in the action (e.g. 50%). According to the 
                distribution of payment, the principal beneficiary had transferred EUR 50 000 as pre-financing to beneficiary B. 
            Amount due: 
            Lump sum shares for partly accepted work = EUR 70 000 – 50% of EUR 70 000 = EUR 35 000 
            Beneficiary B amount due: EUR 35 000. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            Payments received by beneficiary B (according to the report on the distribution of payment): EUR 50 000. 
            Beneficiary B balance: EUR 35 000 (amount due) - EUR 50 000 (payment received) =  - EUR 15 000  
            Since the payment received by Beneficiary B exceeds the amount of the lump sum share is entitled for its part of the 
            work it has fully accomplished, there is a recovery of EUR 15 000 (see Article 50).  
             
            Payment of the balance 
            How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
            be calculated by the Agency on the basis of the financial statements, the final grant amount and 
            the payment already made. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.3, 21.4 and 44.1.2 H2020 General MGA), 
            however with the following specificities: 
            Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
            eligible costs, but simply sums up all the lump sum shares of the beneficiaries for the accepted 
            work. Work partially accomplished due to scientific or technical reasons may exceptionally be 
            accepted by the Agency.  
                  The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if: 
                      the situation could have been solved via an amendment.  
               Example: The beneficiary  argues  that  a  new  research  methodology  made  the  planned  methodology 
               obsolete. The new methodology could have been accepted via an amendment. 
                      non-implementation linked to financial reasons 
               Example: The in-depth market study turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
               beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned. 
                                                                                                              
             
            Step 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
            do not apply to ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants.

            Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other than non-implementation 
            (because non-implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
            All other steps follow the General MGA. 
             
            Example for calculating the payment of the balance: 
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B and C). 
            Beneficiary A is in charge of scaling-up activities, beneficiary B is in charge of health and safety testing activities and 
            beneficiary C is in charge of additional screening of target molecules as well as in charge of establishing a worldwide 
            patent landscape mapping and an IPR strategy accordingly. 
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 150 000.

                     Beneficiary C              30 000                   30 000 
                         Total                 150 000                  150 000 
             
            Case 1: 
            At the end of the action, it appears that beneficiaries A and B fully completed their tasks. However beneficiary C 
            completed only its tasks related to health and safety testing while it failed to establish a worldwide patent landscape 
            mapping.  The  Agency  decides  to  reduce  by  10  %  the  lump  sum  share  of  beneficiary  C  corresponding  to  the 
            proportion of the undelivered part of its work. In addition, the consortium breached its obligation to promote the 
            action and its results under Article 38. The Agency decides to reduce the maximum grant amount by 10 % for that 
            reason. 
            Final grant amount: 
            Lump sum share for accepted work of beneficiary A + Lump sum share for accepted work of beneficiary B + partial 
            lump sum share for partly accepted work of beneficiary C = 100 000 + 20 000 + (30 000 – 10% of 30 000)  
            Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 147 000 
            Grant  reduction  for  other  breaches:  10%  grant  reduction  for  the  action  =  maximum  grant  amount  –  10  % 
            (reduction) = 150 000 – 15 000 = EUR 135 000. 
            Amount resulting from Step 2: EUR 135 000. 
            Lower amount of the two:  EUR 135 000 
            Final grant amount: = EUR 135 000. 
             
            Case 2: 
            Work of beneficiary B and work of beneficiary C were not carried out (i.e. representing a total lump sum shares of 
            EUR 50 000) and therefore the Agency reduced the grant accordingly.  
            Final grant amount: 
            Lump sum shares for accepted work: EUR 100 000 
            No grant reductions for other breaches. 
            Final grant amount: EUR 100 000 ( beneficiary shares: A = EUR 100 000; B = EUR 0; C = EUR 0) 
            Balance & Guarantee Fund release: 
            Payments made: EUR 127 500.  
            Balance: EUR 100 000 (final grant amount) - EUR 127 500 (payments made) = EUR - 27 500 (excess payments of 
            EUR 27 500). 
            Offsetting against Guarantee Fund release: EUR 27 500 - EUR 7 500 (i.e. 5% of EUR 150 000) = EUR 20 000 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from the consortium: EUR 20 000 (negative balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by 
            the principal beneficiary, otherwise the Agency will start a recovery procedure against the beneficiaries that received 
            excess funding). 
            Recovery from the principal beneficiary: 
            The principal beneficiary does not reimburse the Agency and sends the report on the distribution of the payments 
            among beneficiaries (distribution: A= EUR 75 000; B= EUR 25 000; C = 27 500).

            Recovery from beneficiaries: 
            Identifying the beneficiaries with excess funding: 
                A: {(EUR 100 000 / (100 000 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 100 000 (share in the final grant)} - EUR 75 000 
                (payments received) = EUR 25 000 (no payment in excess) 
                B: {0 / (100 000 + 0 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 0 (share in the final grant)} - EUR 25 000 (payments received) = 
                EUR – 25 000 (excess payment of EUR 25 000)  
                C: {0 / (100 000 + 0 + 0) * 100 000 = EUR 0 (share in the final grant)} - EUR 27 500 (payments received) = 
                EUR – 27 500 (excess payment of EUR 27 500)  
                Beneficiaries B and C received payment in excess of its EU contribution and will have to reimburse the Agency.  
                Beneficiary A will have to recover the money owed to it (if any) from the other beneficiaries in the consortium. 
            Division of the debt:  
            Relative share of total payments in excess: 
                Total payments made in excess = 52 500. 
                B: 25 000 /52 500 = 47.62 %. 
                C: 27 500 / 52 500 = 52.38 %. 
            Total to be recovered: EUR 20 000.  
                B: 47.62 % x 20 000 = EUR 9 524 
                C: 52.38 % x 20 000 = EUR 10 476 
                 
                 
            Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount 
            The amount to be recovered (or paid) after the final payment will be calculated by the Agency on 
            the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.4 and 44.1.3 H2020 General MGA), 
            however with the following specificities: 
            Step  1  (Re-calculation  of  the  accepted  EU  contribution)  does  not  apply;  only  Step  2  (Grant 
            reductions) applies.  
            All other steps follow the General MGA (see for the calculations Article 21 H2020 General MGA). 
             
            Examples for calculating recoveries after payment of the balance: 
            Case 1: 
            Grant with three beneficiaries (A, B, C). 
            Beneficiary A is in charge of scaling-up activities, beneficiary B is in charge of health and safety testing activities on 
            50 samples and beneficiary C is in charge of identifying application domains and establishing a market deployment 
            strategy accordingly.   
            Maximum grant amount: EUR 150 000.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019      ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
            The Agency carries out a review on the action and finds out that beneficiary B carried out its health and safety 
            testing activities on half of the number of samples foreseen (i.e. 25 out 50). The Agency therefore reduces the lump 
            sum share of beneficiary B in proportion of the non-implemented work, i.e. 50% of EUR 40 000. 
            Beneficiary revised final grant amount: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary B: EUR 40 000 (accepted lump sum shares) — EUR 20 000 
            (rejected lump sum shares) = EUR 20 000 
            Beneficiary B revised final grant amount: EUR 20 000. 
            The other beneficiaries final grant amounts (i.e. their final grant amount shares) remain unchanged. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            The share of beneficiary B in the final grant amount = EUR 40 000 / 150 000 x 150 000 = EUR 40 000. 
            Balance: EUR 20 000 (revised final grant amount) – EUR 40 000 (final grant share) = EUR -20 000 (excess of EUR 
            20 000). 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 20 000 (negative balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by the 
            beneficiary).

                         1. Checks, reviews and audits 
                         The rules on checks, reviews and audits are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 22 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since (differently from ERC frontier research grants and the standard ERC PoC grants), 
                         ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use actual costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
                                          there will be no financial checks, reviews, or audits to check costs (since beneficiaries have 
                                           no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action, even if they remain subject to 
                                           the accounting rules under the applicable national law).  
                                          checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the implementation of the action (in particular full 
                                           accomplishment of the work as described in Annex 1 of the GA), or on other aspects of the 
                                           grant agreement, such as promoting the action, visibility of EU funding, dissemination and 
                                           exploitation of results, management of intellectual property, etc. 
                         Specific cases (audits): 
                         Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Agency or the Commission may 
                         also audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost 
                         items for which it has fixed unit costs, flat-rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data 
                         to assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for 
                         the beneficiaries that were audited.

                             44.1              Amount to be recovered — Calculation — Procedure 
                             The Agency will — after termination of a beneficiary’s participation, at the payment of the balance 
                             or afterwards — claim back any amount that was paid, but is not due under the Agreement. 
                             Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt [OPTION if 
                             Article 14 applies: (including undue amounts paid by the Agency for lump sum shares declared by its

                             44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation 
                             If  recovery  takes  place  after  termination  of  a  beneficiary’s  participation  (including  the  principal 
                             beneficiary), the Agency will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned, by formally 
                             notifying it a debit note (see Article 50.2 and  50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
                             terms and the date for payment. 
                             If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
                             the amount:  
                                      (a)  by  ‘offsetting’  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —  against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                                               beneficiary concerned by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU 
                                               or Euratom budget).  
                                               In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  Agency  or  the 
                                               Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
                                      (b)  [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
                                               Agency: if a linked third party has accepted joint and several liability (see Article 14), by holding

                             If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
                             be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the 
                             payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full 
                             payment of the amount. 
                             Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against

              44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance 
              If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
              notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the principal beneficiary:  
                  -   informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                  -   specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                      Guarantee Fund;  
                 -   requesting the principal beneficiary to submit a report on the distribution of payments to the 
                     beneficiaries within 30 days of receiving notification, and 
                  -   inviting the principal beneficiary to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
              received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and: 
                  -   pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                      Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                  -   formally notify to the principal beneficiary a debit note for the difference between the amount to 
                      be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This 
                      note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
              If the principal beneficiary does not repay the Agency by the date in the debit note and has not submitted 
              the report on the distribution of payments: the Agency or the Commission will recover the amount set out 
              in the debit note from the principal beneficiary (see below). 
              If the principal beneficiary does not repay the Agency by the date in the debit note, but has submitted the 
              report on the distribution of payments: the Agency will: 
                  (a) identify the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative: 
                          {{{{beneficiary’s approved lump sum share  
                          [plus 
                          its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares]}, 
                          divided by 
                          the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for the approved work calculated 
                          according to Article 5.3.1} 
                          multiplied by  
                          the final grant amount (see Article 5.3)}, 
                          minus 
                          {pre-financing received by the beneficiary}}. 
                  (b) formally notify to each beneficiary identified according to point (a) a debit note specifying the 
                      terms and date for payment. The amount of the debit note is calculated as follows:  
                      {{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned 
                      divided by 
                      the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point 
                      (a)} 
                      multiplied by  
                      the amount set out in the debit note formally notified to the principal beneficiary}.

              44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
              If, for a beneficiary, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5) is lower than its share of the final grant 
              amount, it must repay the difference to the Agency. 
              The beneficiary's share of the final grant amount is calculated as follows: 
                  {beneficiary’s approved lump sum share  
                  [plus 
                  its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares]} 
                  divided by 
                  the total of all beneficiaries’ [and linked third parties’] lump sum shares for the approved work calculated according to 
                  Article 5.3.1} 
                  multiplied by  
                  the final grant amount (see Article 5.3)}. 
              […] 
             
                     
            1. Recovery of undue amounts 
            The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 44 H2020 General MGA).  
            However, since for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations 
            are different (see Article 21).

                              47.1 Conditions  
                              The Agency may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 21.4) if a request 
                              for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:  
                                      (d)  it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Article 20);  
                                      (e)  the final report has not been submitted or is not complete or additional information is needed, or 
                                      (f)  there is doubt about amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) and 
                                               additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary. 
                              47.2 Procedure  
                              The Agency will formally notify the principal beneficiary of the suspension and the reasons why.  
                              The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the Agency (see Article 52).  
                              If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
                              and the remaining period will resume. 
                              If the suspension exceeds two months, the principal beneficiary may request the Agency if the suspension 
                              will continue.  
                              If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the final report (see Article 20) 
                              and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, the Agency may 
                              also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see Article 50.3.1(l)). 
                            
                                            
                         1. Suspension of the payment deadline (EU) 
                         The rules on the suspension of the payment deadline are in principle the same as in the General 
                         MGA (see Article 47 H2020 General MGA).  
                         The ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
                         Since there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could be doubts, the suspension 
                         ground for ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grants targets more generally any kinds of doubts about the 
                         amounts requested for payment (including doubts linked to work implementation).

                              report (see Article 20.4). 
                              If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), the lump sum will not be paid. 
                              The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21.4) on the 
                              basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only part of the 
                              work completed before termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the 
                              Agency.  
                              Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
                              After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
                              36, 37, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

                              The principal beneficiary must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                                           (i)          a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and 
                                                         
                                         (ii)           if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘termination report’ from 
                                                        the  beneficiary  concerned,  for  the  open  reporting  period  until  termination,  containing  an 
                                                        overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20).  
                                                         
                              The information in the termination report must also be included in the final report (see Article 20.4). 
                              If  the  request  for  amendment  is  rejected  by  the  Agency  (because  it  calls  into  question  the  decision 
                              awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may be 
                              terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                              If  the  request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement is amended to introduce the 
                              necessary changes (see Article 55). 
                              The Agency will — on the basis of the termination report and the report on the distribution of payments — 
                              calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the payments received by the beneficiary 
                              exceed this amount. 
                                            
                                       The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps:

                                   If  the  beneficiary’s  part  of  the  work  is  approved,  the  grant  amount  for  the 
                                   beneficiary corresponds to its lump sum share (see Annex 2) for the approved work 
                                   declared in the termination report. 
                                   Only the part of the work completed by the beneficiary before termination will be 
                                   accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the Agency.

                                   the  Agency  will  calculate  the  reduced  grant  amount  for  the  beneficiary  by

                                   of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with 
                                   Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary.

               […] 
               50.3.3  Effects  
               (a)  for termination of the Agreement:  
                   The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit the   
                   final report (see Article 20.4). 
                   If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit the report (see Articles 20.8 
                   and 50.3.1(l)), the principal beneficiary may not submit any report after termination.If the Agency 
                   does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), the lump sum will not be paid. 
                   The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21.4) 
                   on the basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. 
                   Only part of the work completed before termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed 
                   otherwise by the Agency. 
                   This  does  not  affect  the  Agency’s  right  to  reduce  the  grant  (see  Article  43)  or  to  impose 
                   administrative sanctions (Article 45).  
                   The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency (see Article 46). 
                   After  termination,  the  beneficiaries’  obligations  (in  particular  Articles  20,  22,  23,  Section  3  of 
                   Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019      ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
                (a)  for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries: 
                    The principal beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                        (i)  a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned;  
                        (ii)  a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
                            the estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annexes 1and  2) and, if necessary, the addition 
                            of  one  or  more  new  beneficiaries  (see  Article  56).  If  termination  is  notified  after  the 
                            period  set  out  in  Article  3,  no  request  for  amendment  must  be  submitted  unless  the 
                            beneficiary concerned is the principal beneficiary. In this case, the request for amendment 
                            must propose a new principal beneficiary, and  
                        (iii)  if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a termination report 
                            from the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing 
                            an overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 
                            20). 
                    The information in the termination report must also be included in the final report Article 20.4). 
                    If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency (because it calls into question the decision 
                    awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
                    be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                    If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement is amended to introduce 
                    the necessary changes (see Article 56). 
                    The Agency will — on the basis of the termination report and the report on the distribution of 
                    payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the pre-financing payment 
                    received by the beneficiary exceeds this amount. 
                        The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps: 
                            Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum share for the approved part of the work  
                                        If  the beneficiary’s part of the work is approved, the grant amount for the 
                                        beneficiary corresponds to its lump sum share (see Annex 2) for the approved 
                                        work declared in the termination report.  
                                        Only the part of the work completed by the beneficiary before termination 
                                        will be accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the Agency. 
                            Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                                        obligations 
                                        If  the  grant  is  reduced  (due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or 
                                        serious breach of obligations other than non-implementation of the action; see 
                                        Article  43),  the  Agency  will  calculate  the  reduced  grant  amount  for  the 
                                        beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion 
                                        to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, 
                                        in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary. 
                            The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.

                            The other beneficiaries must accede to the Agreement by signing the Accession Form (see Annex 3) in the 
                            electronic  exchange system (see Article 52), within 30 days after its entry into force (see Article 58)

                            In justified cases, the beneficiaries may request the addition of a new beneficiary. 
                            For this purpose, the principal beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 
                            55. It must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic 
                            exchange system (see Article 52).  
                            New beneficiaries must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date of 
                            their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                            If a new beneficiary is added to a mono-beneficiary grant, the grant becomes a multi-beneficiary grant and 
                            the provisions will be applied accordingly. 
                            Article 56.3                       Transfer to a new beneficiary 
                            In justified cases, the beneficiary of a mono-beneficiary grant may request the transfer of the action to a 
                            new beneficiary, provided that this would not call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach 
                            the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                            For this purpose, the beneficiary must submit a request for amendment in accordance with Article 55. It 
                            must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) signed by the new beneficiary in the electronic exchange 
                            system (see Article 52).  
                            The new beneficiary must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreement with effect from the date 
                            of their accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Transfer of the GA  
                         In justified cases, ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot mono-beneficiary grants can be transferred to a new 
                         beneficiary.  
                          
                                                Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
                                         beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article 50) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 56.2).  
                                         NO  transfer  before  the  amendment  has  been  accepted  by  the  Agency.  Transfers  without  a  formal 
                                         amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible 
                                         until the Agency has approved the amendment.

            The transfer may NOT entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
            award the ERC PoC Lump Sum Pilot grant.   
                Example: The Agency will not accept the transfer to a host institution established in a third country. 
             
            2. Procedure  
            The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment to the Agency.  
            For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA).  
            The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
                The date must be selected in the amendment request. The transfer date must be the same 
                date as the accession date of the new beneficiary. Retroactive dates are allowed, but only in 
                exceptional cases and with a specific justification (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA).  
            The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
            rights and obligations under the GA) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the Funding & 
            Tenders Portal) and the PI's justification letter.  
                 For more guidance on amendments, see the Guide on amendment types & supporting documents and the 
              Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.   
               
            3. Effects  
            The former beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from the transfer date or the date of 
            signature of the amendment, whichever is the latest — a transfer report, with information on:  
                   the progress of the work and  
                   the financial statement (for the open period until transfer).  
            This report is for information purposes only. The Agency will use it to decide on how to split the 
            lump sum share and instruct the former beneficiary to transfer the remaining pre-financing to 
            the new beneficiary.  
            The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must also be uploaded later on 
            with the final report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement). 
            The lump sum share will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary — on the 
            basis of the part performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining part to be given to the 
            new beneficiary. If the pre-financing received by the former beneficiary (see Article 21) exceeds 
            the amount of its accepted lump sum share, the Agency will request the former beneficiary to 
            transfer the difference to the new beneficiary.  
            The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning 
            the transfer of the equipment, materials and/or services purchased for the principal investigator.

                                  −        joint  research  training  and/or  doctoral  programmes  for  early-stage  researchers 
                                           (implemented  by  networks  of  beneficiaries  from  the  academic  and  the  non-academic 
                                           sector from different countries).  
                         MSCA-ITN takes the form of European Training Networks (ETN), European Industrial Doctorates 
                         (EID) or European Joint Doctorates (EJD). 
                         MSCA-ITN are multi-beneficiary actions. 
                         They are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020-

                           ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS 
                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary and budget 
                           category (see Articles 5, 6).  
                           4.2  Budget transfers 
                           The estimated budget breakdown indicated in Annex 2 may be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
                             beneficiaries.  
                          
                             This does not require an amendment according to Article 55, if the action is implemented as described in 
                           Annex 1. 
                           [OPTION for all actions except EID with only two beneficiaries: However, no more than 40 % of the 
                           maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1) may be allocated to beneficiaries located in the same country or to 
                             any one international European interest organisation or international organisation.] 
                            
                                            
                         1. Budget categories 
                         The MSCA-ITN MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the MSCA-ITN MGA:  
                                                  costs for recruited researchers 
                                                  institutional costs. 
                          
                                   The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                            5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4). 
                            
                                    . 
                         2. Budget transfers 
                                     
                         The beneficiaries may redistribute person-months between them (as compared with the original 
                         planning set out in Annex 2). This redistribution can be done without requesting an amendment 
                             
                         (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA) — provided that it does not imply a substantial change to the 
                             
                         action as described in Annex 1. 
                                   
                                             The maximum grant amount (see Article 5) can however NOT be increased.  
                                       
                                  Best practice: The coordinator should inform the Agency in advance of any redistribution of 
                                               . 
                                  person-months, in order to establish if an amendment is needed. Changes that only concern the 
                                  consortium-internal  arrangements  on  the  redistribution  of  the  unit  costs  for  management  and 
                                                
                                  indirect costs do NOT need to be notified to the Agency.  
                                           Example: Beneficiary X was unable to implement six person-months, so the consortium informs REA of a 
                                           redistribution of these months to beneficiary Y. REA agreed to this, but since beneficiary Y is located in a 
                                           country where a higher country coefficient  correction  applies  than  in  the country  of  beneficiary  X,  the 
                                           budget transfer can only give 4.5 months to beneficiary Y.

           H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                              MSCA-ITN MGA 
               A redistribution of person-months will also have an impact on the institutional unit costs (since 
               they are also paid according to the person-months declared for recruited researchers). 
               Redistributions are subject to the following: 
                      no impact on the action as described in Annex 1  
                       If  the transfer of person-months implies a substantial change of Annex 1, a formal 
                       amendment (see Article 55) is required. 
                      correct application of the country correction coefficient  
                      the minimum and maximum recruitment durations per researcher 
                      for all actions except for EID with only two beneficiaries: a maximum of 40 % of the 
                       budget may be allocated to beneficiaries established in the same country (or to the 
                       same international European interest organisation or international organisation). 
                       The 40% is determined on the basis of the maximum grant amount. 
                       Example: In an action with a maximum grant amount of EUR 3 000 000, beneficiaries from one 
                       country may not receive more than EUR 1 200 000 (= 40%). If the final grant amount is lower (e.g. 
                       because beneficiaries from other countries implement less person-months than expected) the original 
                       40% ceiling of EUR 1 200 000 will be maintained (beneficiaries will not be penalised for the non-
                       execution of person-months by other beneficiaries). 
           Transfers between budget categories are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories are 
           linked  to  the  same  person-months  declared  for  the  recruited  researchers  (and  it  is  therefore 
           technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another). 
                        
                     Budget flexibility — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                        
                         Redistributions of institutional unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done via 
                          an internal agreement.  
                         Institutional unit costs should be shared with entities with a capital or legal link which incurred 
                          costs  for  research  training  activities  AND  with  partner  organisations  which  incurred  costs  for 
                          hosting secondments (see Article 8). 
                         Research,  training  and  networking  unit  costs  should  be  used  for  the  research,  training  and 
                          networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action-
                          related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of a researcher or to organise additional training 
                          activities). 
                         Unit costs for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the action, 
                          but unused amounts may also be used for other action-related purposes (e.g. to increase the 
                          salary of a researcher).

                           5.2  Form of grant, reimbursement rate and form of costs 
                           The grant reimburses 100 % of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs 
                            grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                          
                           The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘form of costs’): 
                                     (a)  for costs for recruited researchers (living, mobility and family allowances): on the basis of the 
                                              amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (‘unit costs’) and 
                                     (b)  for institutional costs (research, training and networking costs and management and indirect costs): 
                                              on the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs). 
                            
                                            
                         1. Maximum grant amount  
                         The maximum grant amount set out in this Article can NOT be exceeded.  
                                  For MSCA-ITN, the maximum grant amount  is limited to a maximum unit cost equivalent of 
                                  540 person-months (and for EID with only two beneficiaries: 180 person-months).  
                          
                         2. Reimbursement rate 
                         How much? For MSCA-ITN, the reimbursement rate is set at 100 % (see the H2020 Work 
                         Programme (section 3 MSCA)).

                           5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation 
                           The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                           with the Agreement’s terms and conditions. 
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4) — 
                            in the following steps: 
                                     Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                                     Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                     Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                          
                            5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs 
                          
                            The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by the 
                           beneficiaries and approved by the Agency (see Article 21). 
                           5.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                           If the amount obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
                           will be limited to the latter. 
                           5.3.3  Step  3  —  Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
                            obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
                           If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by deducting the 
                           amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                            breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant amount set out in Article 
                           5.1. 
                           The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two: 
                                       -      the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or 
                                       -      the reduced grant amount following Step 3. 
                           […] 
                            
                                         
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For MSCA, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since MSCA grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no-profit rule in 
                         MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).

                           ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS 
                           6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible 
                           Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’) if: 
                                  (a)  they are calculated as follows: 
                                              {amounts per unit set out in Annex 2 
                                              multiplied by 
                                              the number of actual units}. 
                                  (b)  the number of actual units complies with the following: 
                                              -        the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
                                              -        the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and 
                                              -        the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
                                                       documentation (see Article 18). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs  
                         The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
                         conditions set out in this Article) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’). 
                                 
                                             ONLY eligible costs may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4) or declared 
                                       in the financial statements (see Article 20). 
                                       Record-keeping & burden of proof — The burden of proof for eligibility is on the beneficiaries. They 
                                       must keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18) to show that the person-months they declare 
                                       are eligible.  
                                       Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit by the Commission/Agency. Any 
                                       ineligible costs found will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                          
                          
                         Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions, applicable per cost form (for MSCA: only unit 
                         costs; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA).  
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category (see Article 4). 
                          
                         2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible 
                         The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
                         6.1 H2020 General MGA).

                           Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following two budget categories: 
                            
                                            
                         1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The MSCA MGAs have their own budget categories, with their own types of costs, eligibility 
                         conditions and calculation rules. 
                         For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise — for each budget category 
                         — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                          types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                          cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSCA: unit costs)  
                                          eligibility conditions 
                                          how the costs must be calculated.

                        Calculation 
                   1.1 What? This budget category covers the costs for the recruited researchers, by providing for:  
                                      a  monthly  living  allowance  (A.1)  —  to  cover  the  employment  or  fixed-amount 
                                       fellowship  with  social  security  coverage  (i.e.  gross  amount,  including  compulsory 
                                       deductions  under  national  law,  such  as  employer/employee  social  security 
                                       contributions and direct taxes) 
                                      a  monthly  mobility  allowance  (A.2)  —  to  cover  costs  related  to  their  mobility 
                                       (e.g. relating to travel and accommodation)  
                                       This allowance covers private costs of the researchers, not professional costs (which 
                                       are covered by budget category B.1 ’research, training and networking costs’) 
                                AND 
                                      a  monthly  family  allowance  (A.3)  —  for  researchers  with  family,  to  reduce  family-
                                       related obstacles to researcher mobility.  
                                Budget flexibility — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the researcher unit costs (i.e. living, 
                            mobility and family allowances). They must be fully used for each researcher; they can NOT be used to pay 
                            other researchers or other types of costs (see Article 6.2.A(c)).  
                             
                   What not? Management and indirect costs of the beneficiaries are not covered under this budget 
                             
                   category; they are covered under category B ‘institutional costs’ (Article 6.2.B).  
                             
                        Example:  Costs  for  student  registration,  access  to  student  services  (library,  computing,  etc.),  teaching, 
                                  . 
                        supervision, examination and graduation can only be covered by the institutional unit costs.

                  1.2 The costs must be declared as the unit costs fixed by Decision C(2017) 6855  and set out in 
                  Annex 2 and 2a of the GA. 
                         This is currently: 
                                 for the living allowance: EUR 3 270 per researcher per month (person-month) 
                                      To ensure equal treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers, the amount 
                                      for  the  living  allowance  is  adapted  per  country,  by  applying  a  country-specific 
                                      correction coefficient.  
                                            The list of coefficients is published in the H2020 Work Programme (section 3 MSCA) 
                                            in force at the time of the call.  
                                            On the basis of this list, the beneficiaries must determine the coefficient for each 
                                            researcher when s/he is recruited — according to the country of recruitment. This 
                                            coefficient normally does NOT change during the action (unless the researcher is 
                                            formally employed — not only seconded to — by another beneficiary in another 
                                            country during the action).  
                                    for the mobility allowance: EUR 600 per person-month 
                                    for the family allowance: EUR 500 per person-month. 
                                     For the latest information on the amounts and the country correction coefficients, see the H2020 
                                Work Programme (section 3 MSCA) in force at the time of the call. 
                                 
                                 
                  In  practice,  the  declaration  of  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  very  simple  and  almost  completely 
                  automatized: The beneficiaries must only indicate the number of implemented person-months (for 
                  researchers recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT 
                  system.  
                  1.3  The  costs  (in  practice  for  MSCA:  the  person-months)  must  fulfil  the  following  eligibility 
                  conditions: 
                              fulfil  the  general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
                               person-months must be linked to the implementation of the action, be incurred during the 
                               action duration, be identifiable and verifiable, etc.; see Article 6.1) 
                               Costs  NOT  incurred  during  the  periods  of  research  training  activities  (e.g.  during 
                               maternity/parental leave) are ineligible. 
                              be incurred for researchers that:  
                                           are — at the date of recruitment — early-stage researchers (i.e. NOT have a 
                                            doctoral  degree  AND  be  in  the  first  4  years  (full  time  equivalent  research 
                                            experience) of their research career) 
                                            ‘Date of recruitment’ means the first day of the employment of the researcher for 
                                            the  purposes  of  the  action  (i.e.  the  starting  date  indicated  in  the  employment 
                                            contract/equivalent  direct  contract;  see  Article  32).  The  Agency  may  however 
                                            exceptionally accept a different date, if it is linked to the recruitment and justified 
                                            (e.g. by differences in the employment procedure in the country of recruitment). 
                                                   Example: The date of the formal letter offering the position under the action or the date of 
                                                   the signature of the employment contract can also be accepted by the Agency as recruitment 
                                                   date.

                           Years of ‘research career’ are counted from the date on which the researcher 
                           obtained a degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme (either in 
                           the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited) — even if the 
                           doctorate was never started or envisaged. 
                          are recruited under an employment contract/equivalent direct contract (i.e. 
                           other contract with equivalent benefits and social security coverage), including:  
                                  sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits 
                                  pension rights and 
                                  benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases.  
                           If  national law prevents them from recruiting researchers under an employment 
                           contract/equivalent direct contract, beneficiaries may — exceptionally and subject 
                           to  the  Agency’s  prior  agreement  —  offer  a  fixed-amount  fellowship  with 
                           minimum social security coverage, including:  
                                  sickness, parental and invalidity benefits and 
                                  benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. 
                               In this case, the living allowance will be reduced by 50%. 
                           The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire recruitment of the 
                           researcher (i.e. also during secondments, if any).

                                      training and/or PhD degree programme (neither from their own funds, nor from the 
                                      researcher unit cost). The costs that are usually covered by such tuition fees (e.g. 
                                      student registration, access to student services (library, computing, etc.), teaching,

                                      The mobility and family allowances are due to the researchers for each month worked.  
                                      Mobility  and  family  allowances  can  be  paid  to  the  researcher  in  various  ways,  for

                                                  part of his/her salary 
                                                  flight  tickets  for  private  travels,  directly  purchased  or  reimbursed  by  the 
                                                   beneficiary (work-related travels must be paid under category B.1 ’research, 
                                                   training and networking costs’) 
                                                  rental costs, directly paid or reimbursed by the beneficiary. 
                                             Any form is acceptable, provided that: 
                                                              both sides agree  
                                                              it is allowed under national law  
                                                         AND  
                                                              there is no underpayment. 
                                            Example: Researcher X decides to rent an apartment of 750 EUR/month. If the beneficiary is 
                                            willing to sign the rental agreement on behalf of the researcher and the researcher agrees with this 
                                            form of payment, the beneficiary will use 750 EUR of the total amount of 1 100 EUR (mobility & 
                                            family allowance) to pay the rent. The remaining 350 EUR must be paid as part of the salary (or in 
                                            another acceptable form). 
                                            Example: Researcher Y intends to travel to his/her home country for the summer holidays. S/he 
                                            requests the beneficiary to directly purchase the tickets for him/her, and the beneficiary agrees to 
                                            do so. The tickets cost 450 EUR and the beneficiary pays the remaining 150 EUR of the mobility 
                                            allowance as part of the salary (or in another acceptable form).  
                                                    
                                                   Usually, payment as part of the salary is the simplest way to pay these allowances. 
                                               
                                                     
                                      Amounts to be paid in other currencies must be converted into euro as follows:

                                               For ease of implementation, monthly allowances for the recruited researchers can 
                                               be calculated using a conservative exchange rate, if a corrective payment is

                                               This  must  be  clearly  explained  in  the  employment  contract/equivalent  direct 
                                               contract or fixed-amount-fellowship agreement. 
                                                      Example:  Researcher  X  is  recruited  in  a  country  outside  the  euro-zone.  The  average 
                                                      exchange rate is normally EUR 0.9 but this fluctuates from time to time. In order to ensure 
                                                      that the researcher receives a regular monthly income and to avoid exchange rate losses, 
                                                      the beneficiary chooses to apply a conservative exchange rate of EUR 0.87 and to make a

                                                     payment to correct any underpayment at the end of the reporting period. The researcher is 
                                                     fully informed of this procedure at the time of recruitment. 
                               The Agency will check if the allowances are used fully for the benefit of the researchers. 
                               Any underpayments, if not corrected, may lead to a rejection of costs (for that researcher). 
                              for  the  family  allowance:  be  incurred  for  researchers  who  have  —  at  the  date  of  the 
                               recruitment — a family, i.e.:  
                                          persons linked to them by: 
                                                    marriage or 
                                                    a  relationship  with  equivalent  status  to  marriage  (under  the  law  of  the 
                                                     country or region in which this relationship was formalised)  
                                    or 
                                          dependent children who are actually being maintained by the researcher. 
                  1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) as follows: 
                              for the living allowance: 
                               amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of months actually spent by the researchers on the research 
                               training activities (‘number of implemented person-months’) 
                              for the mobility allowance: 
                               amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months 
                              for the family allowance: 
                               amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months 
                         
                                 Beneficiaries  may  declare  a  maximum  of  36  person-months  per  researcher.  Person-months 
                          exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency. 
                                For EID: at least 50 % of the number of person-months declared for each researcher must have been 
                            spent in the non-academic sector.  
                                  This  time  does  not  have  to  be  consecutive  and  may  be  split  in  time  and  between  different 
                                  beneficiaries/partner organisations/entities with a capital or legal link. The 50% must be reached by 
                                  the end of the action (not before, e.g. by the end of a specific reporting period).  
                                  If the researcher unexpectedly leaves the action earlier (for reasons not linked to the beneficiary, e.g. 
                                  because s/he resigns), the Agency may decide to nevertheless accept the costs — despite the 50% 
                                  rule. 
                                  Inter-sectoral mobility between beneficiaries must be international (i.e. spent between beneficiaries 
                                  established in different countries). 
                                   
                  For partial months of recruitment, a pro-rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day 
                                   
                  (for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days).  
                             
                               Example: If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the action, the calculation for the 15 days is: 
                               15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person-months.  
                             
                  Periods in which a researcher was absent for more than 30 consecutive days (for reasons other 
                  than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action (and must be removed from the 
                             
                  financial statement, by changing the researcher declaration). 
                              Examples:  
                               1. If the researcher is absent for 30 consecutive days (or less), the costs incurred during this period can be 
                               charged to the action.  
                               2. If the researcher is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more), no costs can be charged for this period 
                               (from the first day of the absence).

              H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                              MSCA-ITN MGA 
                  This is currently: 
                         for research, training and networking costs: EUR 1 800 per researcher per month 
                            (person-month) 
                         for management and indirect costs: EUR 1 200 per person-month (for beneficiaries 
                                                                                                    84
                            that  already  receive  an  EU/Euratom  operating  grant   in  the  same  period:  only 
                            management costs, i.e. EUR 600 — unless they can demonstrate that the operating 
                            grant does not cover any costs of the action; see Article 6.2.E H2020 General MGA).  
              In  practice,  the  declaration  of  institutional  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  completely  automatized 
              because the IT system automatically calculates  them on the  basis  of  the  number  of  person-
              months declared under budget category A ‘costs for recruited researchers’. 
              1.3 The eligibility of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on) the eligibility 
              of the costs for the recruited researchers. 
                  Institutional costs (research, training and networking costs, management and indirect costs) 
                  are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the recruited researchers are met. Person-
                  months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for recruited researchers’ are also 
                  not eligible for budget category B ‘institutional costs’. 
                  Institutional costs can NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs cannot 
                  be claimed without living allowance, etc.). 
              1.4  The  costs  are  calculated  (automatically  by  the  IT  system)  like  the  costs  for  recruited 
              researchers:  
                      for the research, training and networking costs: 
                       amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the researcher unit 
                       cost)  
                      for the management and indirect costs: 
                       amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the researcher unit 
                       cost) 
                        Budget flexibility — Even if the consortium redistributes parts of the institutional unit costs, the reporting 
                    is always based on the implemented person-months.

                              ‘Ineligible costs’ are: 
                                       (a)  costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1), and in particular costs 
                                               incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49); 
                                       (b)  costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State and 
                                               financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency for the 
                                               purpose of implementing the EU or Euratom budget), in particular, indirect costs if the beneficiary is 
                                               already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the same period, 
                                               unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the action. 
                                       (c)  [OPTION for cost categories explicitly excluded in the work programme: [insert name of excluded 
                                               cost category]].

                             Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                             This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                                                                                                                                                                                7

                                               tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e. hosting and training of researchers); 
                                      -        call  upon  partner  organisations  to  implement  certain  action  tasks  described  in  Annex  1 
                                               (i.e. hosting and training researchers during secondments). 
                           In this case, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action. 
                            
                             7      ‘Entities with a capital or legal link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular, a legal or capital link, which is 
                                    neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation.

                                parties involved in the action 
                         For MSCA actions, the rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do NOT apply. 
                         Instead, MSCA-ITN allows the beneficiaries to use: 
                                          entities with a capital or legal link to them 
                                  and 
                                          partner organisations 
                         to carry out work under the action (third parties involved in the action).  
                          
                                            Beneficiaries using third parties remain fully responsible for them under the GA. 
                                              Best practice: In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, beneficiaries should make internal arrangements 
                                              (e.g. conclude partnership agreements with partner organisations). 
                                               
                          
                                      
                         Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA). 
                                      
                         Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost paid to the beneficiaries; no additional 
                         costs will be reimbursed by the Agency. (Beneficiaries are however encouraged to share the unit 
                                      
                         costs received with them).  
                                      
                         Entities with a capital or legal link are similar to linked third parties under Article 14 of the 
                         H2020 General MGA  (i.e. entities with a link to a beneficiary, which is neither limited to the action 
                                      
                         nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation). 
                                Examples (entities with a capital or legal link):  
                                1. A university is beneficiary of an MSCA-ITN grant (i.e. recruits the researchers), but part of the research 
                                training under the action takes place at its university hospital (which is part of the same structure, but a separate 
                                legal entity).

           H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                              MSCA-ITN MGA 
               2. A large multi-national company (which uses a foundation or a subsidiary for all its HR management, including 
               concluding the employment contracts and paying the staff) participates in an MSCA-ITN action as entity with a 
               capital or legal link implementing the research training activities, while the foundation or subsidiary participates 
               as beneficiary (because it  can recruit the researchers). 
               3. A university hospital (which is part of the public health system without legal personality on its own and which 
               uses a foundation for its HR management) participates in an MSCA-ITN action as entity with a capital or legal link 
               implementing research training activities, while the foundation participates as beneficiary (because it can recruit 
               the researchers). 
           Entities with a capital or legal link may be used for hosting and training of researchers (including 
           during secondments) — and can even implement ALL those activities under the action. But they 
           can NOT recruit the researchers (only beneficiaries can recruit the researchers). 
           Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
           the link with the beneficiary, tasks to be carried out and time spent with them).  
           Contrary to linked third parties under Article 14 of the H2020 General MGA, however, entities with 
           a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
           costs paid to the beneficiaries). 
           Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
           under  H2020  as  beneficiaries  (for  instance,  be  established  in  an  EU  Member  State,  H2020 
           associated country or third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                    
                      For  more  information  on  conditions  for  participation  and  funding,  see  the  H2020  Work  Programme 
                  (section 3 MSCA). 
            
           Partner organisations are third parties involved in the action without a (capital or legal) link to 
           the beneficiary.  
           They may be used to provide training and host researchers, but only during secondments.  
                     Secondments — For MSCA-ITN, secondments are (optional) additional periods of research training with 
                 another beneficiary or a partner organisation (from any country) in order to further enrich the training 
                 experience of the researchers.  
                 They are limited to a maximum of 30% of the time that is declared for research training activities (i.e. 
                 the person-months for the researcher) — except in EID or EJD. 
                     If the researcher unexpectedly leaves the action earlier (for reasons not linked to the beneficiary; e.g. 
                     because s/he resigns), the Agency may decide to nevertheless accept the costs — despite the 30% 
                     rule. 
                 The beneficiaries remain fully responsible for the action implementation (in accordance with the GA) also 
                 during a secondment. 
                  
            
                  
           Partner  organisations  can  NOT  recruit  the  researchers  (only  beneficiaries  can  recruit  the 
                  
           researchers).  
                  
           Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, tasks to be carried out and 
           time spent with them).  
           They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
           beneficiaries).  
           Partner organisations can be established anywhere (EU Member State, H2020 associated country 
           or non-associated third country).

           Specific cases (third parties involved in the action): 
           Authorisation to administer — Coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments 
           and  coordinators that are public bodies may exceptionally delegate the administration of the payments 
           to another legal entity (third party), in most cases a foundation. 
           The third party must fulfil the following conditions: 
                  it must have been granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ by the coordinator 
               AND 
                  it must be affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
                   affairs, including receiving and administering EU funds. 
            
                     Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks. 
                     Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer remain fully responsible for it under 
                  the GA. 
           In this case, the option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisations to administer must be added to the grant 
           agreement. The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8 must be that of the entity with 
           the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
           therefore be registered in the Participant Register and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will get 
           its own PIC — although it is not a beneficiary. 
           Since MSCA-ITN uses unit costs, no additional costs arise for the action. The costs of the entity are 
           covered by the unit costs paid to the coordinator (see Article 6).

                         appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person-months declared are correct, i.e.: 
                                          the employment contracts (or other suitable documents, e.g. fixed-fellowship agreements) 
                                          proof that: 
                                                           the eligibility conditions for the researchers were complied with (e.g. CV showing 
                                                            the researcher’s seniority, copies of diplomas, documents relating to recruitment 
                                                            procedure) 
                                                           the researchers actually worked on the action (e.g. lab books, scientific articles, 
                                                            library records)  
                                                           the obligations set out in Article 32 were complied with 
                                                           the  living,  mobility  and  family  allowances  (including  the  employer’s  compulsory 
                                                            social security payments) were fully paid to the researchers. 
                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. 
                         It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years for grants up 
                         to  EUR  60 000)  or  longer  if  there  are  ongoing  procedures  (such  as  audits,  investigations  or 
                         litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until they end. 
                          
                                    Costs that are not supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence may be rejected (and other measures 
                                   
                             described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well). 
                                   
                                  Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents will bear the full risk of cost rejection by the Agency.

                           ARTICLE 19 — SUBMISSION OF DELIVERABLES 
                           19.1 Obligation to submit deliverables 
                           The coordinator must: 
                                     -        submit a ‘progress report’ within 30 days after one year from the starting date of the action; 
                                     -        organise  a  ‘mid-term  meeting’ between the beneficiaries, entities  with  a  capital  or  legal  link, 
                                              partner organisations and the Agency before the deadline for the submission of the report for RP 1 
                                              (reporting period 1); 
                                     -        establish a supervisory board of the network; 
                                     -        submit any other deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and conditions 
                                              set out in it. 
                           The beneficiaries must: 
                                     -        submit a ‘researcher declaration’ within 20 days after the recruitment of each researcher. 
                           19.2 Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary or the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the Agency may apply 
                           any of the measures provided for in Chapter 6. 
                            
                             
                             
                                            
                         1. Deliverable: Progress report 
                         What & When? The coordinator must — within 30 days after the first year of the action — send 
                         to the Agency a progress report, to inform it about progress on the action. 
                         How? The report must be uploaded directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                          
                         2. Deliverable: Mid-term meeting 
                         What & When? The coordinator must — before the deadline for the periodic report for RP 1 — 
                         organise a mid-term meeting. 
                                  Best practice: It is good practice to send the Agency a draft version of the periodic report (in good 
                                  time before the meeting). 
                          
                         3. Deliverable: Researcher declaration 
                         What & When? The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a researcher declaration for each 
                         recruited researcher — within 20 days after the recruitment date. 
                                  It is important to give correct and complete information in the researcher declaration since the 
                                  data will be automatically inserted in Annex 4 (financial statement), for calculating the living, 
                                  mobility and family allowance units. If the researcher declaration is not provided, it will NOT be 
                                  possible to declare person-months for that researcher. 
                         How? The researcher declarations must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & 
                         Tenders Portal.

                         1. Access rights for researchers 
                         In view of the key role of the recruited researchers in MSCA-ITN, the MSCA-ITN MGA foresees 
                         special access rights for them (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25 and 31 
                         H2020 General MGA): 
                         The beneficiaries must give the recruited researchers access to both background AND results 
                         necessary for their research training activities. 
                                  ‘Background’  means  any  data,  know-how  or  information  —  whatever  its  form  or  nature 
                                  (tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
                                                  is held by beneficiaries before they accede to the GA 
                                                  is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
                                           AND that 
                                                  has been identified by the beneficiaries in accordance with Article 24.  
                                  ‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
                                  information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
                                  generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
                                  rights. 
                         Beneficiaries must moreover ensure that partner organisations and entities with a capital or 
                         legal link give similar access.

                  1. Recruitment and working conditions — Rights for the researchers 
                  In view of the key role of the recruited researchers in MSCA-ITN, the MSCA-ITN MGA foresees a 
                  series of obligations in order to guarantee objective recruitment procedures and best possible 
                  working conditions. 
                        Main obligations (towards the researcher): 
                                    Advertise and publish vacancies internationally 
                                     Beneficiaries must publish vacancies as widely as possible, including on the EURAXESS Jobs

                                     Portal . They may also use their networks to ensure the widest possible dissemination of 
                                     vacancies and information about the application process. 
                                    Follow an open, transparent, impartial and equitable recruitment procedure (i.e. merit 
                                     based, taking into account potential for their professional development and promoting equal 
                                     access for women and men) 
                                    Ensure that no conflict of interest exists in or arises from the recruitment (i.e. take or 
                                     refrain  from  action,  as  appropriate,  where  the  impartial  and  objective  performance  of 
                                     recruitment duties is compromised for reasons involving: 
                                                 family 
                                                 emotional life 
                                                 political or national affinity 
                                                 economic interest or

                                    Ensure that the researchers enjoy at the place of the implementation at least the same 
                                     standards and working conditions as those applicable to local researchers holding a 
                                     similar position 
                                    Host the researchers at their premises (or those of an entity with a capital or legal link) and 
                                     provide training as well as the necessary means for implementing the action (or ensure

                                      Recruited researchers must NOT be requested to pay visa-related fees or tuition fees for 
                                      their research training and/or PhD degree programme (e.g. student registration,, access to

                                     Inform the researchers about key elements of the grant 
                                      Thus, beneficiaries must provide researchers with information on: 
                                                 basic facts about the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions, to make the researcher aware 
                                                  that s/he is a MSCA fellow, including: 
                                                              the researcher’s rights and obligations and  
                                                              where to look for details (MSCA website, Funding & Tenders Portal, Marie

                               6.2 H2020 General MGA).  
                                   The employment contract can state the total/annual salary — as long as it is 
                                   possible to determine the monthly salary (e.g. by dividing the annual salary by 
                                   12). 
                          
           2. Employment contract — Obligations on the researchers 
           The MSCA-ITN GA foresees that there must be an employment contract/equivalent direct contract 
           (or fixed-amount-fellowship agreement), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also 
           towards the researchers. 
               Main obligations (of the researchers): 
                      Work exclusively on the research training activities under the action 
                       This also means that a researcher can NOT hold two MSCA grants at the same time or 
                       engage in  another  professional  activity  or  employment.  Complementary  skills  training 
                       (e.g.   teaching  activity  as  part  of  the  research  training)  is  possible,  but  must  NOT 
                       jeopardise the research activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA). 
                      Not receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the action) other incomes than those 
                       received from their beneficiary (or any other entity referred to in Annex 1) 
                           Example: If the researcher’s allowances fall short of the legal minimum salary in the country in 
                           question, the beneficiary (or other entity in Annex 1) may pay a top-up to make up the difference. 
                      Inform their beneficiary as soon as possible of any events or circumstances likely to affect 
                       the  GA  (such  as,  significant  changes  to  their  career  development  plan  or  personal 
                       circumstances affecting the foreseen activities)  
                      Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights 
                      Maintain confidentiality 
                      Ensure the visibility of EU funding 
                       Researchers  must  acknowledge  funding  under  the  MSCA  grant  in  publications, 
                       communications or patent applications. 
                      Complete and submit — at the end of the training — the evaluation questionnaire and — 
                       two years later — the follow-up questionnaire provided by the Agency.

                           38.1               Communication activities by beneficiaries 
                           38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results 
                           The beneficiaries must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
                           audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner. 
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
                            or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply. 
                           Before  engaging  in  a  communication  activity  expected  to  have  a  mainstream  media  coverage  the 
                           beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52). 
                           38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem 
                           Unless the Agency requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
                           related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
                            and major results funded by the grant must: 
                                      (a) display the EU emblem and 
                                      (b)  include the following text: 
                          
                                               For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
                                               and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number]." 
                                               For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
                                               project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
                                               under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number].” 
                           When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
                           For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
                            first obtaining approval from the Agency. 
                           This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
                           Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
                           or by any other means. 
                           […]

                                media coverage 
                         For MSCA, the rules for promoting the action are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 38.1.1 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, beneficiaries must inform the Agency not only before a communication activity expected 
                         to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream media 
                         coverage (i.e. coverage in any forms of media, e.g. print, TV, radio and electronic, addressing a 
                         non-specialist,  non-scientific  audience,  e.g.  local,  regional  or  national  news).  This  allows  the

           Agency to ensure maximum publicity and to disseminate the coverage further — through social 
           media, news updates, etc. 
            
           2. Visibility of EU funding 
           For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
           27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA). 
           In addition, the beneficiaries must make specific reference to the MSCA grant. Thus, the clause 
           acknowledging EU funding is slightly adapted.

                         What? MSCA-IF funds: 
                                          the recruitment of an experienced researcher for research training activities (‘fellowship’). 
                         MSCA-IF  take  the  form  of  European  Fellowships  (EF)  and  Global  Fellowships  (GF).  European 
                         Fellowships include three additional funding strands: the ‘Career Restart Panel’, the ‘Reintegration 
                         Panel’ and the ‘Society & Enterprise Panel’. 
                         The MSCA-IF annotations are equally applicable to the Widening Fellowships (see H2020 Work 
                         Programme (section 15 Spreading Excellence and Widening Participation)). 
                         MSCA-IF are mono-beneficiary actions. 
                         They are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020-
                         MSCA-IF-2014).

                         1. Action starting date  
                         For MSCA-IF, the rules on the action starting date are in principle the same as in the General MGA 
                         (see Article 3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, the MSCA-IF MGA provides for an additional option, where the actual starting date must 
                         be notified by the beneficiary (i.e. is not set by the Agency, but depends on the beneficiary). 
                         In this case, there will be a maximum deadline for notification set out in Article 3 for both 
                         starting the action and notifying this to the Agency (normally 12 months from the entry into force 
                         of the GA). 
                         The notification must be done directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                         Late notification will delay the pre-financing payment (see Article 21.2 H2020 General MGA). 
                         If the action does not start or the starting date is not notified in time, the Agency may terminate 
                         the GA (see Article 50 H2020 General MGA).

                           ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS 
                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down for the beneficiary, by budget 
                           category (see Articles 5, 6).  
                           4.2 Budget transfers 
                           Not applicable 
                            
                                            
                         1. Budget categories 
                         The MSCA-IF MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the MSCA-IF MGA:  
                                                  costs for the recruited researcher 
                                                  institutional costs. 
                                   The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                           5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4). 
                            
                                      . 
                         2. Budget transfers 
                                       
                         Given that MSCA-IF is a mono-beneficiary action, there is NO redistribution of person-months 
                              
                         between beneficiaries. 
                              
                         Transfers between budget categories are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories are 
                         linked  to  the  same  person-months  declared  for  the  recruited  researcher  (and  it  is  therefore 
                              
                         technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another). 
                              
                          
                                          Budget flexibility — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                                                     The institutional unit cost should be shared with entities with a capital or legal link which incurred 
                                                      costs  for  research  training  activities  AND  with  partner  organisations  which  incurred  costs  for 
                                                      hosting secondments (including for GF outgoing phase; see Article 8). 
                                                     The research, training and networking unit cost should be used for the research, training and 
                                                      networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action-
                                                      related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researcher or to organise additional training 
                                                      activities). 
                                                     The unit cost for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the action, 
                                                      but unused amounts may also be used for other action-related purposes (e.g. to increase the 
                                                      salary of the researcher).

                           The grant reimburses 100 % of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs 
                            grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                          
                            The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                          
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘form of costs’): 
                                     (a)  for costs for the recruited researcher (living, mobility and family allowances): on the basis of the 
                                              amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 (‘unit costs’) and

                                              costs): on the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs).

                         How much? For MSCA-IF,  the  reimbursement  rate  is  set  at  100 %  (see  the  H2020  Work 
                         Programme (section 3 MSCA)).  
                          
                         2. Cost forms  
                         The MSCA MGAs do not use the cost forms of the General MGA, but the unit costs set out in 
                                                                               88

                                  For MSCA-IF, these are unit costs for: 
                                                  costs  for  the  recruited  researcher:  living  allowance,  mobility  allowance  and  family

                                                   indirect costs. 
                         These  are  fixed  amounts  that  must  be  multiplied  by  the  number  of  months  the  recruited

                           5.3  Final grant amount — Calculation 
                           The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                           with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4) — 
                             in the following steps:  
                          
                                     Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
                          
                                     Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                     Step 3 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                           5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                           The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared 
                             by the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21). 
                           5.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                           If the amount obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
                           will be limited to the latter. 
                           5.3.3 Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
                             obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
                           If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximum grant amount by 
                           deducting  the  amount  of  the  reduction  (calculated  in  proportion  to  the  seriousness  of  the  errors, 
                             irregularities or fraud or  breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount set 
                           out in Article 5.1. 
                           The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                                       -      the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
                                       -      the reduced grant amount following Step 3.

                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For MSCA, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since MSCA grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no-profit rule in 
                         MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).

                           ARTICLE 6 — ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE COSTS 
                           6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible 
                           Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’) if:  
                           (a)  they are calculated as follows:  
                                              {amounts per unit set out in Annex 2 
                                               multiplied by 
                                              the number of actual units}. 
                          
                            (b)  the number of actual units complies with the following: 
                                              -        the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
                                              -        the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and 
                                              -        the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
                                                       documentation (see Article 18). 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs  
                         The  grant  can  only  reimburse  eligible  costs  (i.e.  costs  that  comply  with  the  general  and 
                         specific conditions set out in this Article) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’). 
                                           
                                         ONLY eligible costs may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4) or declared in 
                                   the financial statements (see Article 20). 
                                           
                                   Record-keeping & burden of proof — The burden of proof for eligibility is on the beneficiary. It must 
                                           
                                   keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18) to show that the person-months it declares are eligible.  
                                   Compliance  with  eligibility  rules  may  be  subject  to  a  check  or  audit  by  the  Commission/Agency.  Any 
                                           
                                   ineligible costs found will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                                           
                                           
                         Article 6.1 refers to general eligibility conditions, applicable per cost form (for MSCA: only unit 
                         costs; see Article 5).  
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category (see Article 4). 
                          
                         2. General conditions for unit costs to be eligible 
                         The general conditions for eligibility of unit costs are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
                         6.1 H2020 General MGA).

                           Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following two budget categories:

                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The MSCA MGAs have their own budget categories, with their own types of costs, eligibility 
                         conditions and calculation rules. 
                         For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise — for each budget category 
                         — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                          types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                          cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSCA : unit costs)  
                                          eligibility conditions 
                                          how the costs must be calculated.

                                              personal or family reasons (see Article 55), and

                           (c)  the costs have been fully incurred for the benefit of the recruited researcher. 
                                     This latter condition is met if:

                            deductions  under  national  law,  such  as  employer/employee  social  security 
                            contributions and direct taxes) 
                           a  monthly  mobility  allowance  (A.2)  —  to  cover  costs  related  to  his/her  mobility 
                            (e.g. relating to travel and accommodation)  
                            This allowance covers private costs of the researcher, not professional costs (which are 
                            covered by category B.1 ’research, training and networking costs’).

                      Budget flexibility — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the researcher unit costs (i.e. living, 
                  mobility and family allowances). They must be fully used for the researcher; they can NOT be used to pay 
                        
                  other types of costs (see Article 6.2.A(c)).  
                        
                   
             What not? Management and indirect costs of the beneficiary are not covered under this budget 
             category; they are covered under category B ‘institutional costs’ (Article 6.2.B).

                       . 
                  This is currently: 
                        
                         for the living allowance: EUR 4 880 for the researcher per month (person-month) 
                            To ensure equal treatment and purchasing power parity for all researchers, the amount 
                            for  the  living  allowance  is  adapted  per  country,  by  applying  a  country-specific 
                            correction coefficient.  
                   
                                The coefficient for the researcher is set by the Agency during grant preparation — 
                                on the basis of the list of coefficients of the H2020 Work Programme (section 3 
                                MSCA) in force at the time of the call and according to the country of recruitment 
                                (i.e. the country of the beneficiary). 
                                     For GF: there will be two different country-specific correction coefficients:  
                                              one for the outgoing phase: the coefficient of the country where the 
                                               researcher is hosted (i.e. the country of the partner organisation) 
                                              one  for  the  return  phase:  the  coefficient  of  the  country  where  the 
                                               researcher returns to (i.e. the country of the beneficiary). 
                          for the mobility allowance: EUR 600 per person-month 
                          for the family allowance: EUR 500 per person-month. 
                            For the latest information on the amounts and the country correction coefficients, see the H2020 
                        Work Programme (section 3 MSCA) in force at the time of the call. 
                         
                         
             In  practice,  the  declaration  of  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  very  simple  and  almost  completely 
             automatized: The beneficiary must only indicate the number of implemented person-months (for 
             the researcher recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the 
             IT system.

            1.3  The  costs  (in  practice  for  MSCA:  the  person-months)  must  fulfil  the  following  eligibility 
            conditions: 
                   fulfil  the  general  conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
                    person-months must be linked to the implementation of the action, be incurred during the 
                    action duration, be identifiable and verifiable, etc.; see Article 6.1) 
                    Costs  NOT  incurred  during  the  action  implementation  (e.g.  during  maternity/parental 
                    leave) are ineligible. 
                   be incurred for a researcher who:  
                           is — at the date of the call deadline — an experienced researcher (i.e. have a 
                            doctoral  degree  OR  have  at  least  four  years  (full  time  equivalent  research 
                            experience) of research career). 
                            Years  of  ‘research  career’  are  counted  from  the  date  when  the  researcher 
                            obtained a degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme (either in 
                            the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited) — even if the 
                            doctorate was never started or envisaged. 
                           is  recruited  under  an  employment contract/equivalent direct contract (i.e. 
                            other  direct  contract  with  equivalent  benefits  and  social  security  coverage), 
                            including:  
                                   sickness, parental, unemployment and invalidity benefits 
                                   pension rights and 
                                   benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases  
                            If  national  law  prevents  it  from  recruiting  the  researcher  under  an employment 
                            contract/equivalent  direct  contract,  the  beneficiary  may  —  exceptionally  and 
                            subject to the Agency’s prior agreement — offer a fixed-amount fellowship with 
                            minimum social security coverage, including:  
                                   sickness, parental and invalidity benefits and 
                                   benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. 
                                In this case, the living allowance will be reduced by 50%. 
                            The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire action (i.e. also 
                            during optional secondments, if any, and for the GF outgoing phase).  
                                For GF: The third country partner organisation that hosts the beneficiary in the 
                                GF outgoing phase can (exceptionally) issue an additional employment contract 
                                to ensure equivalent coverage during the stay in the third country.  
                                    Example: A German university recruits the fellow for the total duration of the action (i.e. 
                                    provides the main employment contract under the action) and sends him/her to a US 
                                    university. Continuing the German social security during the stay in the US would be so 
                                    expensive, that the beneficiary asks the US partner organisation to conclude an additional 
                                    employment contract, in order to insure the researcher in the US. 
                            Staff provided by a temporary work agency — The beneficiary must always 
                            recruit the researcher directly. Recruitments via other means (e.g. temporary work 
                            agency) are NOT allowed.  
                           as a rule, be employed full-time  
                            Part-time employment can be accepted: 
                                   subject to prior approval by the Agency

                                   on  professional  grounds  (except  during  the  outgoing  phase  for  GF)  in 
                                    agreement with the beneficiary 
                                   if limited to a maximum of 50% of the time spent under the action 
                                Part-time employment for professional reasons can be requested in order to 
                                pursue supplementary activities, such as creating a company, pursuing another 
                                research project, engaging in advanced studies not related to the MSCA grant, 
                                etc. It cannot be requested in order to participate in another MSCA grant at the 
                                same time. 
                                When  part-time  employment  for  professional  reasons  is  accepted,  the 
                                beneficiary  must  ensure  reliable  time  records  (e.g.  timesheets)  either  on 
                                paper or in a computer-based time recording system. 
                                In the case of part-time employment, costs are reported as pro-rata of the full-
                                time unit cost. 
                                Example: For one month of 50% part-time employment, 0.5 units should be claimed. 
                                 
                                 If NOT possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons, beneficiaries 
                             may request a GA suspension to interrupt the employment (see Article 49.1.1.2).  
                                 
                                 
                                 . 
                           work exclusively on the research training activities 
                                  
                            Work  outside  the  action  is  NOT  allowed  (—  unless  part-time  for  professional 
                              
                            reasons was approved). Complementary skills training (e.g.  teaching activity as 
                            part of the research training) is possible, but must not jeopardise the research 
                              
                            activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA). 
                              
                   have  been  fully  incurred  for  the  benefit  of  the  researcher  (i.e.  fully  paid  to  the 
                    individual for whom they are claimed) 
                              
                    The beneficiary’s costs (gross amount) for researcher remuneration, mobility and family 
                              
                    allowance must be at least as high as the living, mobility and family allowances set out in 
                    Annex 2. Lower costs are considered as underpayment. 
                        Social security contributions and taxation (under national law) are to be counted as 
                        part of the beneficiary’s costs for the recruited researcher (gross amount). 
                        The mobility and family allowances are due to the researchers for each month worked.  
                        Mobility  and  family  allowances  can  be  paid  to  the  researcher  in  various  ways,  for 
                        example as: 
                               part of his/her salary  
                               flight  tickets  for  private  travels,  directly  purchased  or  reimbursed  by  the 
                                beneficiary (work-related travels must be paid under category B.1 ’research, 
                                training and networking costs’) 
                               rental costs paid or reimbursed by the beneficiary, etc. 
                            Any form is acceptable, provided that: 
                                -   both sides agree 
                                  it is allowed under national law   
                                AND 
                                  there is no underpayment.

                                 Example: Researcher X decides to rent an apartment of 750 EUR/month. If the beneficiary is 
                                 willing to sign the rental agreement on behalf of the researcher and the researcher agrees with this 
                                 form of payment, the beneficiary will use 750 EUR of the total amount of 1 100 EUR (mobility & 
                                 family allowance) to pay the rent. The remaining 350 EUR must be paid as part of the salary (or in 
                                 another acceptable form). 
                                 Example: Researcher Y intends to travel to his/her home country for the summer holidays. S/he 
                                 requests the beneficiary to directly purchase the tickets for him/her, and the beneficiary agrees to 
                                 do so. The tickets cost 450 EUR and the beneficiary pays the remaining 150 EUR of the mobility 
                                 allowance as part of the salary (or in another acceptable form). 
               
                                      Usually, payment as part of the salary is the simplest way to pay these allowances. 
                                  
                                       
                           Amounts to be paid in other currencies must be converted into euro as follows: 
                                  
                                     if a daily rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European 
                                      Union for the currency in question: amounts must be converted into euro at the 
                                      average of the daily exchange rates published over the corresponding reporting 
                                                                                       90

                                     if no daily rate is published: amounts must be converted at the average of the 
                                      monthly  accounting  rates  over  the  reporting  period,  using  the  currency 
                                                                                       91

                                 For ease of implementation, the monthly allowances for the recruited researcher 
                                 can be calculated using a conservative exchange rate, if a corrective payment is 
                                 then made (to the researcher) immediately after the end of the reporting period. 
                                 This  must  be  clearly  explained  in  the  employment  contract/equivalent  direct 
                                 contract or fixed-amount-fellowship agreement. 
                                      Example: Researcher X is recruited in a country outside the euro-zone. The average exchange 
                                      rate is normally EUR 0,9 but this fluctuates from time to time. In order to ensure that the 
                                      fellow receives a regular monthly income and to avoid exchange rate losses, the beneficiary 
                                      chooses to apply a conservative exchange rate of EUR 0,87 and to make a payment to correct 
                                      any underpayment at the end of the reporting period. The fellow is fully informed of this

                   checked by the Agency during the selection procedure), the recruited researcher must — at the date of the 
                   call deadline —: 
                            comply with the mobility rule, i.e. not have resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, 
                             studies, etc.) in the country of the beneficiary for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately 
                             before to the call deadline (— unless the beneficiary is an ‘international European interest organisations’ 
                             or international organisations, for whom the mobility rule is limited to time spent with them) 
                                  Short stays (such as holidays), compulsory national services (such as mandatory military service) and 
                                  procedures for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention (1951 Refugee Convention and 
                                  the 1967 Protocol) are NOT counted. 
                             For EF Career Restart Panel, Reintegration Panel and Society & Enterprise Panel: specific mobility rule — not 
                             more than 3 years in the 5 years immediately before the call deadline 
                             For GF: the mobility rule is checked for the country of the partner organisation, not for the country of the 
                             beneficiary (i.e. where the outgoing phase takes place, not where the return phase takes place).  
                            for GF and EF Reintegration Panel: be nationals or long-term residents of a EU Member State or an 
                             H2020 associated country.  
                             ‘Long-term resident’ means a period of legal and continuous residence in a EU Member States or 
                             H2020 associated countries for 5 or more consecutive years. Periods outside these countries will be 
                             taken into account if shorter than 6 consecutive months and all in all not more than 10 months.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                    MSCA-IF MGA 
                          For EF Reintegration Panel: The long-term residence requirement will not apply to researchers who 
                          have obtained refugee status under the Geneva Convention (1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 
                          Protocol) in a EU Member State or H2020 associated country. 
                      for EF Career Restart Panel: not have been active in research for at least 12 months immediately 
                       before the call deadline 
                           ‘Active in research’ means being employed or holding a scholarship. Parental leaves and unpaid 
                           leaves of absence will not be counted as periods of active engagement in research, even if a 
                           formal  employment  relationship  exists  during  these  periods.    Publication  activities  or  mere 
                           association to a university are not taken into account either.  
                      for the family allowance: have a family, i.e.  
                              persons linked to the researcher by: 
                                      marriage or 
                                      a relationship with equivalent status to marriage (under the law of the country or 
                                       region in which this relationship was formalised)  
                           or 
                              dependent children who are actually being maintained by the researcher. 
                     
                    The Agency will check if the allowances are used fully for the benefit of the researcher. Any 
                    underpayments, if not corrected, may lead to a rejection of costs for the researcher. 
             
            1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) as follows: 
                   for the living allowance: 
                    amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of months actually spent by the researchers on the research 
                    activities (‘number of implemented person-months’) 
                   for the mobility allowance: 
                    amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months 
                   for the family allowance: 
                    amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months 
                      The beneficiary may declare a maximum of 24 person-months for the researcher (or 36 months for 
                  GF and EF Career Restart Panel). Person-months exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency. 
                      
                  
            For partial months of recruitment, a pro-rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day 
            (for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days).  
                  
                    Example: If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the action, the calculation for the 15 days is: 
                    15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person-months.  
                  
            Periods in which a researcher was absent for more than 30 consecutive days  (for reasons other 
            than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action (and must be removed from the 
                  
            financial statement, by requesting an amendment to suspend the action; see Article 49.1.1.2). 
                    Examples:  
                    1. If the researcher is absent for 30 consecutive days (or less), the costs incurred during this period can be 
                    charged to the action. 
                    2. If the researcher is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more), no costs can be charged for this period 
                    (from the first day of the absence) and the action must be suspended.

                                              Budget flexibility — There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                                                        The  institutional  unit  costs  should  be  shared  with  entities  with  a  capital  or  legal  link  which 
                                                         incurred costs for research training activities AND with partner organisations which incurred costs 
                                                         for hosting secondments (including for GF outgoing phase; see Article 8). 
                                                        The research, training and networking unit cost should be used for the research, training and 
                                                         networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action-
                                                         related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researcher or to organise additional training 
                                                         activities). 
                                                        The unit cost for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the

                         In  practice,  the  declaration  of  institutional  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  completely  automatized 
                         because the IT system automatically calculates  them on the  basis  of  the  number  of  person-
                         months declared under budget category A ‘costs for the recruited researcher’.  
                         1.3 The eligibility of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on) the eligibility 
                         of the costs for the recruited researcher. 
                                  Institutional costs (research training and networking costs, management and indirect costs) 
                                  are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the recruited researcher are met. Person-
                                  months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for the recruited researcher’ are 
                                  also not eligible for budget category B ‘institutional costs’. 
                                  Institutional costs can NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs cannot 
                                  be claimed without living allowance, etc.). 
                         1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for the recruited 
                         researcher:  
                                          for the research, training and networking costs: 
                                           amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the researcher 
                                           cost) 
                                          for the management and indirect costs: 
                                           amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the researcher 
                                           cost)

                           ‘Ineligible costs’ are: 
                                     (a)  costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1),  in particular costs 
                                              incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49); 
                                     (b)  costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
                                              and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency for

                                              beneficiary is already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the 
                                              same period, unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the 
                                              action. 
                                     (c)  [OPTION  for  cost  categories  explicitly  excluded  in  the  work  programme:  [insert  name  of

                                                                      INVOLVED IN THE ACTION 
                           ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                   IN THE ACTION  
                           The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
                                      -       call upon entities with a capital or legal link to the beneficiary5, to implement certain action tasks 
                                              described in Annex 1 (i.e. hosting and training of the researcher); 
                          
                                      -       call upon partner organisations to implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e. hosting 
                                              and training the researcher during secondment). 
                           In this case, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action. 
                            
                             5      ‘Entities with a capital or legal link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular, a legal or capital link, which is 
                                    neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
                                parties involved in the action 
                         For MSCA actions, the rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do NOT apply. 
                         Instead, MSCA-IF allows the beneficiary to use: 
                                          entities with a capital or legal link to it 
                                  and 
                                          partner organisations 
                         to carry out work under the action (third parties involved in the action).  
                          
                                            A beneficiary using third parties remains fully responsible for them under the GA. 
                                              Best practice: In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, the beneficiary should make internal arrangements 
                                              (e.g. conclude partnership agreements with partner organisations). 
                                               
                         Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA). 
                                      
                                      
                         Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost paid to the beneficiary; no additional 
                         costs will be reimbursed by the Agency. (The beneficiary is however encouraged to share the unit 
                                      
                         costs received with them.) 
                                      
                         Entities with a capital or legal link are similar to linked third parties under Article 14 of the 
                         H2020 General MGA (i.e. entities with a link to the beneficiary, which is neither limited to the 
                                      
                         action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation). 
                                Examples (entities with a capital or legal link):  
                                1. A university is beneficiary of an MSCA-IF grant (i.e. recruits the researcher), but part of the research training 
                                under the action takes place at its university hospital (which is part of the same structure, but a separate legal 
                                entity).

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                    MSCA-IF MGA 
               2. A large multi-national company (which uses a foundation or a subsidiary for all its HR management, including 
               concluding the employment contracts and paying the staff) participates in an MSCA-IF action as entity with a 
               capital or legal link implementing research training activities, while the foundation or subsidiary  participates as 
               beneficiary (because it is can recruit the researchers). 
               3. A university hospital (which is part of the public health system without legal personality on its own and which 
               uses a foundation for its HR management) participates in an MSCA-IF action as entity with a capital or legal link 
               implementing research training activities, while the foundation participates as beneficiary (because it can recruit 
               the researchers). 
            Entities with a capital or legal link may be used for hosting and research training of researchers 
            (including during a secondment) — and can even implement ALL those activities under the action. 
            But they can NOT recruit the researcher (only the beneficiary can recruit the researcher). 
            Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
            link with the beneficiary and tasks to be carried out).  
            Contrary to linked third parties under Article 14 of the H2020 General MGA, however, entities with 
            a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
            costs paid to the beneficiary). 
            Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
            under H2020 as the beneficiary (for instance, be established in an EU Member State or H2020 
            associated country). 
                Example: For the EF Society & Enterprise Panel, the entities with a capital or legal link must also be from the 
                non-academic sector. 
                     
                      For  more  information  on  conditions  for  participation  and  funding,  see  the  H2020  Work  Programme 
                  (section 3 MSCA). 
             
            Partner organisations are third parties involved in the action without a (capital or legal) link to 
            the beneficiary.  
            They may be used to provide training and host researchers, but only during a secondment. 
                     Secondments — For MSCA-IF, secondments are either:  
                         (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation (from an EU Member 
                          State  or  H2020  associated  country),  in  order  to  further  enrich  the  training  experience  of  the 
                          researcher 
                      or 
                         for GF: (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner organisation (from a third country). 
                  Optional secondments are limited to a maximum of 3 months (for actions with duration of up to 18 
                  months) and 6 months (for actions with duration of more than 18 months).  
                  The beneficiary remains fully responsible for the action implementation (in accordance with the GA) also 
                  during a secondment. 
                   
                   
            Partner  organisations  can  NOT  recruit  the  researcher  (only  the  beneficiary  can  recruit  the 
            researcher).  
                   
                For GF: The third country partner organisation that hosts the beneficiary in the GF outgoing 
                   
                phase can (exceptionally) issue an additional employment contract to ensure equivalent social 
                security coverage during the stay in the third country (see Article 6). 
            Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, tasks to be carried out).  
            They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
            beneficiary).  
            Partner organisations for optional secondments must be established in an EU Member State or 
            H2020 associated country; partner organisations for GF outgoing phase must be established in a 
            non-associated third country.

                                                           the  researcher  actually  worked  on  the  action  (e.g. lab  books,  scientific  articles, 
                                                            library records)

                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. 
                         It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years for grants up 
                         to  EUR  60 000)  or  longer  if  there  are  ongoing  procedures  (such  as  audits,  investigations  or 
                         litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until they end. 
                                   Costs that are not supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence may be rejected (and other measures 
                            described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well). 
                                  Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents will bear the full risk of cost rejection by the Agency.

                         In view of the key role of the recruited researcher in MSCA-IF, the MSCA-IF MGA foresees special 
                         access rights for him/her (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25 and 31 H2020 
                         General MGA): 
                         The beneficiary must give the recruited researcher access to both background AND results 
                         necessary for his/her research training activities. 
                                  ‘Background’  means  any  data,  know-how  or  information  —  whatever  its  form  or  nature 
                                  (tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
                                                  is held by the beneficiary before it accedes to the GA (i.e. before grant signature) 
                                                  is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
                                           AND that 
                                                  has been identified by the beneficiary in accordance with Article 24.  
                                  ‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
                                  information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
                                  generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
                                  rights. 
                         The beneficiary must moreover ensure that partner organisations and entities with a capital 
                         or legal link (if any) give similar access.

             In view of the key role of the recruited researcher in MSCA-IF, the MSCA-IF MGA foresees a series 
             of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions.  
                  Main obligations (towards the researcher): 
                          Ensure that the researcher enjoys at the place of the implementation at least the same 
                           standards and working conditions as those applicable to local researchers holding a 
                           similar position 
                          Host the researcher at its premises (or at those of an entity with a capital or legal link) and 
                           provide training as well as the necessary means for implementing the action (or to ensure 
                           that this is provided by the entity with a capital or legal link). 
                           If the Agency finds that the beneficiary is not supporting the research training activities in 
                           line with Annex 1 of the GA, it may reduce the grant. 
                          Ensure that the researcher is adequately supervised 
                          Ensure that — at the beginning of the research training activities — a career development 
                           plan is established and support its implementation 
                          Support secondments of the researcher (if any) and ensure that they are limited to a 
                           maximum of 3 months (for actions of up to 18 months) or 6 months (for actions of more 
                           than 18 months)

                  EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                             MSCA-IF MGA 
                                       
                                       
                                                      Secondments — For MSCA-IF, secondments can be:  
                                                             (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation (from 
                                                              an EU Member State or H2020 associated country), in order to further enrich the 
                                                              training experience of the researcher 
                                                        and/or 
                                                             for  GF:  (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner organisation (from a third 
                                                              country) (see Article 8) 
                                                  
                                      For GF: Also support time spent by the researcher with the beneficiary (or an entity with a 
                                                  
                                      capital or legal link and/or a partner organisation) before the outgoing phase (limited to a 
                                                  
                                      maximum of 3 months) and the researcher’s return (mandatory return-period must always 
                                      be 12 months) 
                                                  
                                     Ensure that the researcher does NOT receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the 
                                      action)  other  incomes  than  those  received  from  the  beneficiary  (or  any  other  entity 
                                      referred to in Annex 1) 
                                     Ensure that the researcher does NOT have to bear any costs for the implementation of the 
                                      action as described in Annex 1 
                                      The recruited researcher must NOT be requested to pay visa-related fees or tuition fees for 
                                      the research training neither from his/her own funds, nor from the researcher unit cost. 
                                     Comply with the arrangements on intellectual property rights. 
                                                                                                                                                                        95

                                     Assist the researcher in the administrative procedures related to his/her recruitment 
                                      (e.g. helping with visa procedures or preparing the career development plan)

                                     Inform the researcher about key elements of the grant 
                                      Thus, the beneficiary must provide the researcher with information on: 
                                                 basic facts about the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions, to make the researcher aware 
                                                  that s/he is a MSCA fellow, including: 
                                                              the researcher’s rights and obligations and  
                                                              where to look for details (MSCA website, Funding & Tenders Portal, Marie 
                                                               Curie Alumni Association (MCAA), etc.) 
                                                 the specific action in question (e.g. planned secondments, events, etc.) and 
                                                 whom they have appointed to supervise him/her for the duration of the research 
                                                  training activities, including during optional secondments/GF outgoing phase with 
                                                  partner organisations. 
                                      Moreover, the employment contract/equivalent direct contract (or fixed-amount-fellowship 
                                      agreement) contract must clearly state: 
                                                 the starting date of research training activities under the action and its duration 
                                                  The starting date and duration must match those in Article 3 of the GA. 
                                                 the allowances that the researcher is entitled to receive (and if this is paid in a

                                                  Article 6).  
                                                         The employment contract can state the total/annual salary — as long as it is 
                                                         possible to determine the monthly salary (e.g. by dividing the annual salary by 
                                                         12).

            2. Employment contract — Obligations on the researcher 
            The MSCA-IF GA foresees that there must be an employment contract/equivalent direct contract 
            (or fixed-amount-fellowship agreement), in order to formalise the commitments in the GA also 
            towards the researcher. 
                Main obligations (of the researcher): 
                       Work exclusively on the research training activities 
                        This also means that a researcher can NOT hold two MSCA grants at the same time, or 
                        engage in another professional activity or employment — unless part-time employment for 
                        professional  reasons  has  been  approved  (see  Article  55).  Complementary  skills  training 
                        (e.g. teaching activity as part of the research training) is possible, but must NOT jeopardise 
                        the research activities (and must be set out in Annex 1 of the GA).  
                       Not receive (for activities carried out in the frame of the action) other incomes than those 
                        received from the beneficiary (or any other entity referred to in Annex 1) 
                            Example: If the researcher’s allowances fall short of the legal minimum salary in the country in 
                            question, the beneficiary (or other entity in Annex 1) may pay a top-up to make up the difference. 
                       Inform the beneficiary as soon as possible of any events or circumstances likely to affect 
                        the  GA  (such  as,  significant  changes  to  their  career  development  plan  or  personal 
                        circumstances affecting the foreseen activities)  
                       Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights 
                       Maintain confidentiality 
                       Ensure the visibility of EU funding 
                        The  researcher  must  acknowledge  funding  under  the  MSCA  grant  in  publications, 
                        communications or patent applications. 
                       Complete and submit — at the end of the training — the evaluation questionnaire and — 
                        two years later — the follow-up questionnaire provided by the Agency.

                           38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results 
                           The beneficiary must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
                           audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner.  
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
                             or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply. 
                           Before  engaging  in  a  communication  activity  expected  to  have  a  mainstream  media  coverage  the 
                           beneficiary must inform the Agency (see Article 52).

                           Unless the Agency requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
                             related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
                           and major results funded by the grant must:

                                       (b)  include the following statement: 
                              
                                               For communication activities: “This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 
                                               research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number].” 
                                                
                                               For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part 
                                               of  a  project  that  has  received  funding  from  the  European  Union’s  Horizon  2020  research  and  innovation 
                                               programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number].” 
                            
                             When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
                            
                             For the purposes of its obligations under this Article, the beneficiary may use the EU emblem without first 
                           obtaining approval from the Agency. 
                              
                           This does not, however, give it the right to exclusive use.  
                              
                           Moreover, it may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration or 
                             by any other means.  
                           […] 
                            
                                            
                         1. Communication activities (beneficiary) — Promoting the action — Mainstream 
                                media coverage 
                         For MSCA, the rules for promoting the actions are in principle the same as in the General MGA 
                         (see Article 38.1.1 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However,  the  beneficiary  must  inform  the  Agency  not  only  before  a  communication  activity 
                         expected to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
                         media  coverage  (i.e.  coverage  in  any  forms  of  media,  e.g. print,  TV,  radio  and  electronic, 
                         addressing a non-specialist, non-scientific audience, e.g. local, regional or national news). This

            2. Visibility of EU funding 
            For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
            27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA). 
            In addition, the MSCA-IF beneficiary (in all actions except MSCA-IF Widening Fellowships) must 
            make specific reference to the MSCA grant. Thus, the clause acknowledging EU funding is slightly 
            adapted.

                           ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION 
                           49.1               Suspension of the action implementation by the beneficiary 
                           49.1.1   Conditions — Procedure 
                           49.1.1.1  The  beneficiary  may  suspend  implementation  of  the  action  or  any  part  of  it,  if  exceptional 
                           circumstances  —  in  particular  force  majeure  (see  Article  51)  —  make  implementation  impossible  or 
                             excessively difficult. 
                          
                             In this case, the beneficiary must immediately formally notify suspension to the Agency (see Article 52), 
                           stating: 
                                      (a)  the reasons why and 
                                      (b)  the expected date of resumption. 
                           The suspension will take effect the day this notification is received by the Agency. 
                           Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the beneficiary must immediately formally notify 
                           the Agency and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which the action will be 
                             resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new 
                           situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has been terminated 
                             (see Article 50). 
                           The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date may 
                           be before the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                           Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6). 
                           49.1.1.2  The  beneficiary  may  request  suspension  of  the  action  implementation  (or  any  part  of  it)  for 
                           professional, personal or family reasons (including parental leave). 
                           For this purpose, the beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment (to make the necessary 
                             changes and to set the date of resumption) in accordance with Article 55. 
                           The suspension will take effect on the date set out in the amendment. 
                           Costs incurred during suspension of the action implementation are not eligible (see Article 6).

                                family reasons (beneficiary) 
                         In addition to the normal grounds for GA suspension (see Article 49 H2020 General MGA), the 
                         beneficiary  in  MSCA-IF  actions  may  request  suspension  for  professional,  personal  or  family 
                         grounds of the recruited researcher (including parental leave, long-term sick leave or another 
                         professional opportunity). 
                         Suspension  must be requested if the researcher is absent for more than 30 consecutive days (for 
                         reasons other than normal annual leave).

            2. Procedure  
            The beneficiary must submit a request for amendment, indicating: 
                   the starting and (planned) end date of the suspension and  
                   the (planned) resumption date when the action will be resumed (i.e. automatically end 
                    date +1 day). 
                In  principle,  suspensions  (other  than  for  parental  leave)  should  not  exceed  30 %  of  the 
                action duration. 
            For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA). 
             
            3. Effects 
            Costs incurred during the suspension are NOT eligible (see Article 6.3).

                           55.1               Conditions 
                           The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would call 
                           into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                           Amendments may be requested by any of the parties. 
                           The  beneficiary  may,  in  particular,  request  a  change  of  the  time  spent  on  the  action  (part-time 
                            employment) for professional, personal or family reasons (including parental leave).

                                employment (beneficiary) 
                         What?  For  MSCA-IF,  the  beneficiary  may  request  an  amendment  to  change  the  time  the 
                         researcher spends on the action (i.e. from full-time to part-time, part-time to full-time or to a 
                         different  percentage  of  part-time)  —  on  professional,  personal  or  family  grounds  (including 
                         parental leave).  
                                               If NOT possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons, beneficiaries may request 
                                         a GA suspension to interrupt the employment (see Article 49.1.1.2).  
                                                  . 
                         How?  The  amendment  should  be  requested  immediately  (retroactive  change  is  possible,  if

                         The action duration will be automatically adapted (to extend the action in line with the part-time

                           56a.1 Conditions 
                           The beneficiary may request that the research training activities are transferred to a new beneficiary, if there 
                           are serious reasons affecting its capacity to implement the action (without being entitled to any additional 
                             EU funding for doing so). 
                           56a.2 Procedure 
                          
                             The beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment to the Agency (see Article 55). 
                          
                             The request must include: 
                          
                                      -       the reasons why; 
                          
                                      -       the date the change takes effect; 
                                      -       the opinion of the researcher and its supervisor; 
                                      -       a proposal for the necessary changes, including — if necessary — the appointment of the new 
                                              supervisor and the Accession Form for  the new beneficiary (see Annex 3). 
                           The change will take effect on the day set out in the amendment. 
                           56a.3 Effects 
                           If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the 
                           necessary changes in order to reallocate the tasks of the former beneficiary (see Article 55). 
                           In this case, the former beneficiary must: 
                                      -       transfer immediately the remaining contribution to the new beneficiary and 
                                      -       submit — within 30 days from the change — a ‘transfer report’, containing an overview of the 
                                              progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20). 
                          
                             The maximum grant amount will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary, on the 
                           basis of the number of actual units in line with Article 6. 
                           The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements concerning the management of intellectual 
                           property rights and other issues under the Agreement. 
                           If  the  Agency  considers that  the  reasons  provided  do  not  justify  the  transfer,  it  will  reject  the  request 
                             specifying the grounds for the rejection.

                  NO  transfer  before  the  amendment  has  been  accepted  by  the  Agency.  Transfers  without  a  formal 
                  amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible 
                  until the Agency has approved the amendment. 
                 
            The transfer may be based on any ground that is linked to the beneficiary and affects objectives 
            of the action (i.e. implementing the research training activities). 
                    Examples: Internal reorganisation affecting implementation of the action; dismantling of the research 
                    team involved in the action; departure of the supervisor from the beneficiary’s premises; serious conflict 
                    between the researcher and the supervisor. 
                Personal circumstances of the researcher (e.g. other professional opportunities, personal or 
                family  commitments) are NOT considered valid grounds for transferring the GA to a new 
                beneficiary. These must be addressed by suspending the action (see Article 49.1) or a switch 
                to part-time employment (see Article 55). 
            The transfer may NOT entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
            award the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
                Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the new beneficiary does not fulfil the eligibility conditions or does 
                not have sufficient financial and operational capacity. 
             
            2. Procedure 
            The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment to the Agency.  
            For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA). 
            The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA. 
                The date must be selected in the amendment request. The ‘transfer date’ should normally be 
                the date the researcher starts working with the new beneficiary. In order to allow for full 
                synchronisation of dates, chose the entry into force of the amendment (i.e. not a fixed date) 
                as transfer date and put this date also as starting date in the employment contract for the 
                researcher. If there is a gap in employment (between transfer date and employment starting 
                date at the new beneficiary), request an amendment to suspend the action (AT82; must be 
                done before the end of the action). 
            The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
            rights and obligations under the Agreement) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the Funding 
            & Tenders Portal).  
            The maximum grant amount/action duration will be adapted to take into account the country 
            correction coefficient of the new beneficiary. 
                            The maximum grant amount (see Article 5) will NOT be increased.  
                            . 
                If the new beneficiary is in a country with a lower country correction coefficient, the maximum 
                grant amount (see Article 5.1) will be lowered. 
                             
                         
                If the new beneficiary is in a country with a higher country correction coefficient, the action 
                duration will normally be adapted, so that the maximum grant amount can stay the same. If 
                         
                (exceptionally) the action duration is not changed, the beneficiary must top-up the salary of 
                the researcher and pay the difference between the former and the new correction coefficient 
                         
                (using e.g. the management and indirect costs or own funding).

            3. Effects 
               The former beneficiary must submit — within 30 days from the transfer date or the date of 
               signature of the amendment, whichever is the latest — a transfer report, with information on: 
                  the progress and 
                  the financial statement (for the open period until transfer). 
            This report is for information purposes only. The Agency will use it to check the eligible costs and 
            instruct the former beneficiary to transfer the remaining pre-financing to the new beneficiary. 
            The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must also be uploaded later on 
            with the next periodic report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement). 
            The maximum grant amount will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary 
            — on the basis of the researcher months already spent with the former beneficiary. 
            The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning 
            intellectual property and other issues.

                         What? MSCA-RISE funds: 
                                          the exchange of staff members (between beneficiaries or between a beneficiary and a 
                                           partner organisation) for research and innovation activities (‘secondments’). 
                                                    Secondments — For MSCA-RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action (see Article 8).

                           ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED BUDGET AND BUDGET TRANSFERS 
                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary and budget 
                           category (see Articles 5, 6).  
                           4.2                Budget transfers 
                           The estimated budget breakdown indicated in Annex 2 may be adjusted by transfers of amounts between the 
                            beneficiaries.  
                          
                            This does not require an amendment according to Article 55, if the action is implemented as described in 
                           Annex 1. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Budget categories 
                         The MSCA-RISE MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the MSCA-RISE MGA:  
                                                  costs for seconded staff members 
                                                  institutional costs. 
                                    The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                           5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4). 
                            
                                      . 
                         2. Budget transfers 
                                       
                         The beneficiaries may redistribute person-months between them (as compared with the original 
                              
                         planning set out in Annex 2). This redistribution can be done without requesting an amendment 
                         (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA) — provided that it does not imply a substantial change to the 
                              
                         action as described in Annex 1.  
                              
                                              The maximum grant amount (see Article 5) can however NOT be increased.  
                          
                                        
                                  Best practice: The coordinator should inform the Agency in advance of any redistribution of 
                                                . 
                                  person-months, in order to establish if an amendment is needed. Changes that only concern the 
                                  consortium-internal  arrangements  on  the  redistribution  of  the  unit  costs  for  management  and 
                                                 
                                  indirect costs do NOT need to be notified to the Agency. 
                                         Example: Beneficiary A plans to second 24 person-months, but can finally only implement 22. At the same 
                                         time, beneficiary B is able to implement 2 additional person-months compared to the original planning. In 
                                           this case, the budget transfer between the beneficiaries is possible without an amendment. 
                                        
                                  A redistribution of person-months will also have an impact on the institutional unit costs (since 
                                  they are also paid according to the person-months declared for seconded staff members). 
                                        
                                  Redistributions are subject to the following:

                      no impact on the action as described in Annex 1 
                       If  the transfer of person-months implies a substantial change of Annex 1, a formal 
                       amendment is required. 
                      the minimum and maximum secondment duration. 
           Transfers between budget categories are formally NOT possible, because all budget categories are 
           linked to the same person-months declared for the seconded staff (and it is therefore technically 
           not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another). 
                   Budget flexibility — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                       Redistributions of institutional unit costs within the consortium are allowed, but should be done via 
                        an internal agreement.  
                       Institutional unit costs should also be shared with entities with a capital or legal link and partner 
                        organisations which incurred costs for hosting secondments (see Article 8). 
                       Research,  training  and  networking  unit  costs  should  be  used  for  the  research,  training  and 
                        networking activities foreseen in Annex 1, but unused amounts may be used for other action-related 
                        purposes  (e.g.  to  cover  travel  and  subsistence  costs  of  a  staff  member,  to  organise  additional 
                        training activities or horizontal networking events). 
                       Unit costs for management and indirect costs should be used for the management of the action, but 
                        unused amounts may also be used for other action-related purposes (e.g. to cover travel and 
                        subsistence costs a staff member, to organise additional training activities or horizontal networking 
                        events).

                           The grant reimburses 100 % of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs 
                             grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                          
                             The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                          
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following forms (‘form of costs’): 
                                     (a)  for costs for seconded staff members: on the basis of the amount(s) per unit set out in Annex 2 
                                              (‘unit costs’) and 
                                     (b)  for institutional costs (research, training and networking costs, management and indirect costs): on 
                                              the basis of the amount per unit set out in Annex 2 (unit costs). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Reimbursement rate 
                         How much? For MSCA-RISE, the reimbursement rate is set at 100% (see the H2020 Work 
                         Programme (section 3 MSCA)). 
                          
                         2. Cost forms 
                         The MSCA MGAs do not use the cost forms of the General MGA, but the unit costs set out in 
                                                                               97

                                  For MSCA-RISE, these are unit costs for: 
                                                  costs for seconded staff members: top-up allowance 
                                                  institutional  costs:  research,  training  and  networking  costs  and  management  and 
                                                   indirect costs. 
                         These  are  fixed  amounts  that  must  be  multiplied  by  the  number  of  months  the  staff  were 
                         seconded  and  spent  on  research  and  innovation  activities  (person-months);  they  cannot  be 
                         changed.

                           5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation 
                           The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                           with the Agreement’s terms and conditions. 
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21.4) — 
                             in the following steps: 
                          
                                      Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate  
                          
                                      Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                      Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of  obligations 
                           5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate 
                           The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by 
                             the beneficiaries and approved by the Agency (see Article 21). 
                           5.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                           If the amount obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
                           will be limited to the latter. 
                           5.3.3  Step  3  — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of  
                             obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
                           If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant amount by deducting the 
                           amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or  
                             breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant amount set out in Article 
                           5.1. 
                           The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two: 
                                       -      the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or 
                                       -      the reduced grant amount following Step 3. 
                           […] 
                            
                                          
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For MSCA, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since MSCA grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no-profit rule in 
                         MSCA MGAs (Step 3 of Article 5.3 of the General MGA).

                           6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible 
                           Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’), if: 
                                 (i)  they are calculated as follows: 
                                          {amounts per unit set out in Annex 2 
                                          multiplied by 
                                          the number of actual units}. 
                                 (ii)  the number of actual units complies with the following: 
                                          - the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
                                          - the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and 
                                          - the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
                                                   documentation (see Article 18). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs  
                         The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
                         conditions set out in this Article) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’). 
                                           
                                             ONLY eligible costs may be entered into the estimated budget for the action (see Article 4) or declared 
                                       in the financial statements (see Article 20). 
                                           
                                       Record-keeping & burden of proof — The burden of proof for eligibility is on the beneficiaries. They 
                                           
                                       must keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18) to show that the person-months they declare are 
                                       eligible.  
                                           
                                       Compliance with eligibility  rules  may  be  subject  to  a  check  or  audit  by  the  Commission/Agency.  Any 
                                       ineligible costs found will be rejected (see Article 42).

                           Costs are eligible, if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following two budget categories: 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The MSCA MGAs have their own budget categories, with their own types of costs, eligibility 
                         conditions and calculation rules. 
                         For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise — for each budget category 
                         — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                          types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                          cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSCA: unit costs)  
                                          eligibility conditions

                           6        ‘Entities with a capital or legal link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary or partner organisations, in particular, a legal or 
                                    capital link, which is neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation. 
                           7        For the definition, see Article 2.1(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 11 December 
                                    2013  laying  down  the  rules  for  participation  and  dissemination  in  “Horizon  2020  -  the  Framework  Programme  for  Research  and

                  1. Seconded staff costs (A.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — 
                       Calculation 
                  1.1 What? This budget category covers the costs for the seconded staff members, by providing 
                  for:  
                                     a monthly top-up allowance (A) — for travel, accommodation and subsistence costs 
                                      relating to the secondment.  
                   
                             Budget flexibility — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the seconded staff unit costs (i.e. top-
                         up allowance). They must be fully used for the staff member (to cover the travel, accommodation and 
                         subsistence costs of the staff member); they can NOT be used to pay other staff members or other types of 
                         costs (see Article 32).  
                             Secondments — For MSCA-RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action (see Article 8).  
                          
                          
                  What not? Research, training and networking costs and management and indirect costs of the 
                          
                  beneficiaries  are  not  covered  under  this  budget  category;  they  are  covered  under  category  B 
                          
                  ‘institutional costs’ (Article 6.2.B). 
                                                                                                                                                                    98
                  1.2 These costs must be declared as the unit cost fixed by Decision C(2017) 6855  and set out 
                  in Annex 2 and 2a of the GA. 
                               . 
                                
                         This is currently: 
                               −      for the top-up allowance: EUR 2 100 per seconded staff member per month (person-
                                      month). 
                          
                                        For the latest information on the amount, see the H2020 Work Programme (section 3 MSCA) in 
                                   force at the time of the call. 
                          
                                    
                          
                  In  practice,  the  declaration  of  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  very  simple  and  almost  completely 
                                    
                  automatized: The beneficiaries must only indicate the number of implemented person-months (for 
                  staff members seconded under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the 
                  IT system.  
                  1.3  The  costs  (in  practice  for  MSCA:  the  person-months)  must  fulfil  the  following  eligibility 
                  conditions: 
                              fulfil  the  general  conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
                               person-months must be linked to the implementation of the action, be incurred during the 
                               action duration, be identifiable and verifiable, etc.; see Article 6.1) 
                              be incurred for staff members that — at the date of secondment —:  
                                     are one of the following three: 
                                           early stage researchers (i.e. NOT have a doctoral degree AND be in the first four 
                                            years  (full time equivalent research experience) of their research career)  
                                           experienced researchers (i.e. have a doctoral degree OR at least four years (full 
                                            time equivalent research experience) of research career), or

                           organisation and not with a purely administrative role). 
                
                                Examples (not eligible administrative, managerial or technical staff):  
                                1. Ms B, employed by beneficiary B as an accountant, is not eligible for secondment as her 
                                tasks are not directly related to support research and innovation activities. 
                                2. Mr Y, employed by beneficiary/partner organisation Y and carrying out secretarial tasks, is 
                                not eligible for secondment because he is not directly involved in research and innovation 
                                activities. 
                       Years  of  ‘research  career’  are  counted  from  the  date  on  which  the  researcher 
                       obtained the degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctoral programme (either in 
                       the country in which it was obtained or in which s/he is recruited or from where s/he is 
                       seconded) — even if a doctorate was never started or envisaged. 
                      have already been actively engaged in or linked to research and innovation activities 
                       at the premises of the sending beneficiary/partner organisation/entity with a capital or 
                       legal link, continuously for at least 1 month (full time equivalent) 
                           Examples:  
                           1. Mr Y is employed by/has a fellowship with/is a registered PhD candidate of beneficiary Y as from 
                           1 January 2014; Mr Y will not be eligible for a secondment from 1 January 2014 but would be 
                           eligible for secondment as from 1 February 2014. 
                           2. Ms X is employed 50% part-time by beneficiary X as from 1 January 2014. Ms X will not be 
                           eligible for a secondment from 1 February 2014, but would be eligible for secondment as from 1

                                  complies with internal practices and  
                                  during  the  secondment:  confers  to  the  sending  beneficiary/partner 
                                   organisation/entity with a capital or legal link the necessary legal means in 
                                   terms  of  controls  and  instructions  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the 
                                   activities in line with GA obligations.  
                                   If  this  is  not  the  case,  the  beneficiary/partner  organisation/entity  with  a 
                                   capital  or  legal  link  must  conclude  a  contract  which  allows  this  (or  a 
                                   supplementary agreement) — before the secondment. 
                                   Example: A PhD-candidate can be seconded if s/he: has a contract allowing him/her to 
                                   work  full-time  on  the  R&I  activities  of  the  action  during  the  secondment  under  the 
                                   instructions of the sending beneficiary/partner organisation/entity with a capital or legal 
                                   link. 
                  be incurred for secondments:  
                      that last at least 1 month and no longer than 12 months  
                       Splitting into several periods is allowed. 
                           Example: If a secondment is split into two-week periods, the person-month may be claimed (since 
                           the one-month minimum is satisfied). However, if the staff member participates only in the first 
                           two-week period and the second one never takes place, the beneficiary may not claim any person-
                           months for the secondment. 
                           Best practice: If the split is not already indicated in Annex 1, the coordinator should 
                           inform the Agency before the secondment. 
                           For the minimum duration, only splits within secondments of same staff, from same 
                           sending  beneficiary/partner  organisation  to  same  hosting  beneficiary/partner

                           Examples:  
                           A and B exchange staff for 12 months within a RISE project. A sends 10 persons to B for one year 
                           (i.e. 120 person-months) and B sends the same number to A (also 120 person-months). 
                           Case 1:  A is a beneficiary established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country and B is 
                           a partner organisation established in a third country listed in General Annex A to the H2020 Work

                           A may claim only 120 person-months (for its own staff; the person-months of the staff seconded 
                           by the partner organisation are not eligible). 
                           Case 3:  A and B are both beneficiaries established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated 
                           country.

                           If a person is a staff member of two or more organisations which participate in a 
                           RISE project, s/he can NOT be seconded from both organisations. 
                                Example: A researcher is both professor at the university and CEO of its own SME and both 
                                organisations are involved in a RISE project. This researcher can only be seconded from one 
                                of the two organisations.  
                               By  contrast,  a  staff  member  can  be  seconded  from  one  participating 
                               organisation to two or more participating organisations in a RISE project — as 
                               long as the total person-months per staff member do not exceed 12 (see also 
                               Article 19).  
            
                    Other conditions — Although NOT a cost eligibility condition for MSCA-RISE, but an ‘other obligation’ 
               under Article 32:  
                      the top-up allowance must be fully used for the staff member (i.e. fully used to cover the travel, 
                       accommodation and subsistence costs of the staff member for whom it is claimed). 
                
                
           1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) as follows: 
                
                  for the top-up allowance: 
                   . 
                   amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of months actually spent by the seconded staff members on the 
                   research and innovation activities (including travel) (‘implemented person-months’) 
                    
                
                       Beneficiaries may declare a maximum of 12 person-months per seconded staff member. Person-
                  months exceeding this number will be rejected by the Agency. 
                
                   
                
                
                      . 
               For partial months of recruitment, a pro-rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each 
                
               day (for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days).  
                       
                   Example: A staff member is seconded from a beneficiary to a partner organisation from 12 March to 25 
                    August. The calculation is five months (from 12 March to 11 August) plus 14/30 (for the 14 days from 12 to 
                    25 August). In this case, insert 5.47 as number of person-months.

                         H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                                                                                          MSCA-RISE MGA 
                         In  practice  the  declaration  of  institutional  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  completely  automatized 
                         because the IT system automatically calculates  them on the basis of the number of person-
                         months declared under budget category A ‘costs for seconded staff members’. 
                         1.3 The eligibility of the institutional costs is directly linked to (and conditional on) the eligibility 
                         of the costs for seconded staff members. 
                                  Institutional costs (research training and networking costs, management and indirect costs) 
                                  are  eligible  only  if  ALL  the  eligibility  conditions  for  the  seconded  staff  members  are  met. 
                                  Person-months which are not eligible for budget category A ‘costs for seconded staff members’ 
                                  are also not eligible for budget category B ‘institutional costs’. 
                                  Institutional costs can NOT be claimed separately (e.g. management and indirect costs cannot 
                                  be claimed without top-up allowance). 
                         1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) like the costs for seconded staff 
                         members:  
                                          for the research, training and networking costs: 
                                           amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the seconded staff 
                                           unit cost) 
                                          for the management and indirect costs: 
                                           amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of implemented person-months (declared for the seconded staff 
                                           unit cost) 
                          
                                      Budget flexibility — Even if the consortium redistributes parts of the institutional unit costs, the reporting 
                                is always based on the implemented person-months.

                            ‘Ineligible costs’ are: 
                                     (a)  costs  that  do  not  comply  with  the  conditions  set  out  above  (in  Article  6.1),  in  particular  costs 
                                              incurred during suspension of the action implementation (see Article 49); 
                                       (b)  costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State 
                                                and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency for 
                                                the  purpose  of  implementing  the  EU  or  Euratom  budget),  in  particular,  indirect  costs  if  the 
                                                beneficiary is already receiving an operating grant financed by the EU or Euratom budget in the 
                                                same period, unless it can demonstrate that the operating grant does not cover any costs of the 
                                                action. 
                                       (c) [OPTION  for  cost  categories  explicitly  excluded  in  the  work  programme:  [insert  name  of 
                                               excluded cost category]]. 
                          
                            6.4 Consequences of declaration of ineligible costs 
                           Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                     -        call  upon  partner  organisations  to  implement  certain  action  tasks  described  in  Annex  1 
                                              (i.e. seconding and hosting staff); 
                                     -        call upon entities with a capital or legal link to the beneficiaries or to partner organisations9, to 
                                              implement certain action tasks described in Annex 1 (i.e. seconding and hosting staff). 
                           In this case, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action. 
                            
                            9      ‘Entities with a capital or legal link’ are entities that have a link with the beneficiary or partner organisations, in particular, a legal or 
                                   capital link, which is neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
                                parties involved in the action 
                         For MSCA actions, the rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do NOT apply. 
                         Instead, MSCA-RISE allows the beneficiaries to use: 
                                          partner organisations  
                                  and 
                                          entities with a capital or legal link to a beneficiary or a partner organisation 
                         to carry out work under the action (third parties involved in the action). 
                          
                                             Beneficiaries using third parties remain fully responsible for them under the GA. 
                                              Best practice: In order to be able to fulfil this obligation, beneficiaries should make internal arrangements 
                                              (e.g. conclude partnership agreements with partner organisations). 
                                               
                         Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article 1 H2020 General MGA). 
                                       
                         Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost paid to the beneficiaries; no additional 
                                       
                         costs will be reimbursed by the Agency. (Beneficiaries are however encouraged to share the unit 
                                       
                         costs received with them.)  
                                       
                         Partner organisations are third parties involved in the action without a (capital or legal) link to 
                         a beneficiary.   
                                       
                         They may participate in the exchanges by seconding and hosting staff.

           H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             MSCA-RISE MGA 
            
                    Secondments — For MSCA-RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action. They can be between 
                 beneficiaries/entities with a capital or legal link OR between beneficiaries/entities with a capital or legal link 
                 and partner organisations (from a third country). 
                 They must have a minimum duration of 1 month and a maximum duration of 12 months (per seconded 
                 staff member). 
                 The beneficiaries remain  fully  responsible  for  the  action  implementation  (in  accordance  with  the  GA) 
                 during the secondments. 
                  
           Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, tasks to be carried out).  
                  
                  
           They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
           beneficiaries).   
                  
           Partner organisations must be established in a non-associated third country (i.e. not EU Member 
           State or H2020 associated country). 
           Entities with a capital or legal link are similar to linked third parties under Article 14 of the 
           H2020 General MGA (i.e. entities with a link to a beneficiary or a partner organisation — which is 
           neither limited to the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation).     
           They may participate in the exchanges by seconding and hosting staff.  
           Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, name of the entity, type of 
           the link with the beneficiary/partner organisation and tasks to be carried out).  
           Contrary to linked third parties under Article 14 of the H2020 General MGA, however, entities with 
           a capital or legal link can NOT claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit 
           costs paid to the beneficiaries). 
           Entities with a capital or legal link must fulfil the same conditions for participation and funding 
           under H2020 as the beneficiary/partner organisation they are linked to (for instance, if linked to a 
           beneficiary: be established in an EU Member State or H2020 associated country; if linked to a 
           partner organisation: be established in a non-associated third country AND be established in the 
           same country as their beneficiary/partner organisation.  
               Examples (eligible entities with capital or legal link): 
               1.  University X (established in France) is part of a Joint Research Unit (JRU) with beneficiary Y (also established 
               in France). Mr. X is employed by university X and is to be sent on a secondment to beneficiary Z. University X 
               will be considered as entity with a capital or legal link to beneficiary Y and can therefore second Mr. X.  
               2.  SME X (established in Portugal) is  a  subsidiary  of  beneficiary  Y  (also  established  in  Portugal).  Ms.  X  is 
               employed by SME X and is to be sent on a secondment to partner organisation Z. SME X will be considered as 
               entity with a capital or legal link to beneficiary Y and can therefore second Ms. X.  
               3.  Mr.  X  is  formally  employed by  foundation  X  (established  in  Spain)  which  does  the  HR  management for 
               beneficiary  Y  (also  established  in  Spain).  Mr.  X  actually  works  with  beneficiary  Y  and  should be  sent on  a 
               secondment to beneficiary Z. Foundation X will be considered as entity with a capital or legal link to beneficiary 
               Y and can therefore second Mr. X.   
               Examples (ineligible entities with capital or legal link): 
               1. SME X (established in Germany) is a subsidiary of applicant Y (established in Greece). Ms. X is employed by 
               SME X and is to be sent on a secondment to partner organisation Z. Since SME X is not established in the same 
               country as applicant Y, it cannot act as entity with a capital or legal link for the purposes of a MSCA-RISE grant. 
               Therefore, Ms X cannot be seconded. 
               2. University X (validated as academic; established in Sweden) is member of an association of universities 
               (applicant Y; validated as non-academic). Mr. X is employed by university X and is to be sent on a secondment 
               to applicant Z (validated as academic). University X cannot act as entity with a capital or legal link of applicant Y 
               for the purposes of the MSCA-RISE grant because this would circumvent the inter-sector mobility rules (mix of 
               academic and non-academic).

           Specific cases (third parties involved in the action): 
           Authorisation to administer — Coordinators that are secondary or higher education establishments 
           and coordinators that are public bodies may exceptionally delegate the administration of the payments 
           to another legal entity (third party), in most cases a foundation. 
           The third party must fulfil the following conditions: 
                  it must have granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ by the coordinator  
               AND 
                  it must be affiliated, controlled or set up by the coordinator in order to handle its administrative 
                   affairs, including receiving and administering EU funds. 
                    
                     Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks. 
                     Coordinators using a third party with authorisation to administer remain fully responsible for it under 
                  the GA. 
                
           In this case, the option in Article 41.2(b) for authorisations to administer must be added to the grant 
           agreement. The bank account number to be provided under Article 21.8 must be that of the entity with 
           the authorisation to administer and the payments will be transferred directly to it. The entity must 
           therefore be registered in the Participant Register and validated by the Commission/Agency. It will get 
           its own PIC — although it is not a beneficiary. 
           Since MSCA-RISE uses unit costs, no additional costs arise for the action. The costs of the entity are 
           covered by the unit costs paid to the coordinator (see Article 6).

                         appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person-months declared are correct, i.e.: 
                                             proof that: 
                                                       the eligibility conditions for the seconded staff members were complied with (e.g.

                                                       the secondment was eligible (e.g. agreement on the secondment; travel documents 
                                                            and/or access rights for the host organisation's premises to show the duration; lab

                                                            and innovation activities)

                                                            must  be  adequate  to  show  the  duration  of  the  secondments  clearly  and 
                                                            unequivocally. 
                                                       the obligations set out in Article 32 were complied with 
                                                            Thus for the obligation to fully use the unit cost for seconded staff members (to

                                                            keep proof of the amounts paid (e.g. bank transfers to the staff member, travel

                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. 
                         It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years for grants up 
                         to  EUR  60 000)  or  longer  if  there  are  ongoing  procedures  (such  as  audits,  investigations  or 
                         litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until these procedures end. 
                          
                                     Costs that are not supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence may be rejected (and other measures 
                              described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well). 
                                    Beneficiaries that throw away supporting documents bear the full risk of cost rejection by the Agency.

                           19.1 Obligation to submit deliverables 
                           The coordinator must: 
                                      -       submit a ‘progress report’ within 30 days after the end of each year, except when the periodic and 
                                              final reports are due; 
                                      -       organise a ‘mid-term meeting’ between the beneficiaries, partner organisations, entities with a 
                                              capital or legal link and the Agency before the deadline for the submission of the report for RP 1 
                                              (reporting period 1); 
                                      -       submit any other deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and conditions 
                                              set out in it. 
                           The beneficiaries must: 
                                      -       submit  a  ‘researcher  declaration’  within  20  days  of  the  secondment  of  each  seconded  staff 
                                              member. 
                           19.2 Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If a beneficiary or the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the Agency may apply 
                           any of the measures provided for in Chapter 6. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Deliverable: Progress report 
                         What & When? The coordinator must — after each year except if a periodic report is due (i.e. 
                         normally after the first and third year of the action) — submit to the Agency a progress report, to 
                         inform it about progress on the action. 
                         How? The report must be uploaded directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal.  
                          
                         2. Deliverable: Mid-term meeting 
                         What & When? The coordinator must — before the deadline for the periodic report for RP 1 — 
                         organise a mid-term meeting.  
                                Best practice: It is good practice to send the Agency a draft version of the periodic report (in good 
                                time before the meeting). 
                          
                         3. Deliverable: Researcher declaration 
                         What & When? The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a ‘researcher declaration’ for each 
                         seconded staff member — within 20 days from the start of the secondment. 
                                  It is important to give correct and complete information in the researcher declaration, since 
                                  this  information  will  be  used  to  determine  the  eligibility  of  the  person-months  that  are 
                                  declared.

           H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                             MSCA-RISE MGA 
               If a secondment is split in several stays of shorter duration, the researcher declaration must 
               only be submitted once — at the beginning of the secondment — and indicate each split.  
                   Example: Beneficiary A is sending Mr A to partner organisation B for one year, though split in two half-year 
                   periods. In this case, A has to submit the researcher declaration only at the beginning of the first period of 
                   secondment, indicating the split. No additional declaration is necessary for the second half. 
               If a staff member is seconded to more than one beneficiary/partner organisation within 
               the action duration, several researcher declarations must be submitted (within 20 days from 
               the start date of each secondment). Secondments to entities with a capital or legal link will be 
               counted as secondments to the beneficiary/partner organisation they are linked to and must 
               therefore be covered by the same researcher declaration. 
                   Example: Beneficiary A is sending Mr A to partner organisation B for half a year and to beneficiary C for 
                   half a year. In this case, the researcher declaration has to be submitted twice, each time within 20 days 
                   from the beginning of the secondment to a different beneficiary/partner organisation. 
           How? The researcher declarations must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & 
           Tenders Portal. 
            
           Specific case (deliverables): 
           Researcher declaration for staff of the partner organisations and entities with a capital or 
           legal link — For secondments from partner organisations/entities with a capital or legal link, it is the 
           beneficiary that must submit the researcher declarations.

                         1. Access rights for seconded staff members 
                         In  view  of  the  key  role  of  the  seconded  staff  members  in  MSCA-RISE,  the  MSCA-RISE  MGA 
                         foresees special access rights for them (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25 
                         and 31 H2020 General MGA): 
                         The  beneficiaries  must  give  the  seconded  staff  members  access  to  both  background  AND 
                         results necessary for their research and innovation activities. 
                                  ‘Background’  means  any  data,  know-how  or  information  —  whatever  its  form  or  nature 
                                  (tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
                                                  is held by beneficiaries before they accede to the GA 
                                                  is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
                                           AND that 
                                                  has been identified by the beneficiaries in accordance with Article 24.  
                                  ‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
                                  information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
                                  generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
                                  rights. 
                         Beneficiaries must moreover ensure that partner organisations and entities with a capital or 
                         legal link give similar access.

               32.2 Consequences of non-compliance 
               If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
               Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                
               17    Commission Recommendation No 251/2005/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct 
                   for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p. 67).   
              
                        
             1. Recruitment and working conditions — Rights for the seconded staff members 
             In  view  of  the  key  role  of  the  seconded  staff  members  in  MSCA-RISE,  the  MSCA-RISE  MGA 
             foresees a series of obligations in order to guarantee best possible working conditions for them.  
                  Main obligations (towards the staff members): 
                          Ensure that the seconded staff members have the relevant expertise to participate in the 
                           action 
                           The profiles of  the  staff  to  be  seconded  must  be  in  line  with  the  tasks  and  objectives 
                           described in Annex 1. 
                          Ensure that the seconded staff members enjoy at least the same standards and working 
                           conditions at the place of secondment as those applicable to persons holding a similar 
                           position there 
                          Ensure that the seconded staff members are covered by an appropriate medical insurance 
                           scheme 
                          Ensure that the staff members are seconded full-time.  
                                For  part-time  staff  members  this  may  require  a  change  of  their  relationship  (i.e. 
                                conclude a contract or a supplementary agreement), to allow the secondment to be 
                                implemented on a full-time basis. 
                          Ensure that the rights and obligations remain unchanged during the secondment 
                            
                                       Secondments — For MSCA-RISE, secondments are the core activity of the action (see 
                                   Article 8).  
                                    
                           Beneficiaries and partner organisations must: 
                                    not penalise the staff members or reduce their rights due to the participation in the 
                                     action and 
                                    in particular, since their normal remuneration is not covered by the grant (which is 
                                     only a top-up allowance to cover the travel, accommodation and subsistence costs 
                                     of  the  secondment), continue to pay them as before, according to their internal 
                                     practices.  
                           Changes in favour of the seconded staff member are of course accepted. 
                          Ensure that the seconded staff members are reintegrated (into the beneficiary/partner 
                           organisation/entity with a capital or legal link) after the secondment, so as to allow for a 
                           transfer of knowledge and maximise the impact of the action (as regards knowledge-sharing 
                           and long-term collaboration)  
                          Comply with the arrangements on intellectual property rights. 
                                                                                                                          102

                      Assist the seconded staff members in the administrative procedures related to their 
                       secondment (e.g. helping with visa procedures) 
                      Inform the staff member about key elements of the grant 
                       Beneficiaries must inform seconded staff members of all details concerning the secondment 
                       and the research and innovation activities (such as description, conditions, location, and 
                       timetable for implementation). 
                      Ensure that the costs for seconded staff members are fully used for the benefit of the 
                       seconded staff members 
                       They can be: 
                                  paid  directly  to  the  seconded  staff  member  in  advance  or  via  different 
                                   instalments or  
                                  managed centrally by the beneficiary according  to the specific needs of the 
                                   secondment. 
                        Ensure  that  the  seconded  staff  members  do  not  have  to  bear  any  costs  for  the 
                         implementation of the action as described in Annex 1. 
                         The seconded staff members must NOT be requested to pay tuition fees for their research 
                         and innovation training neither from their own funds, nor from the staff member unit cost. 
            
           2. Obligations on the seconded staff members 
           Although they do not need to be explicitly reflected in their employment contract (or fellowship or 
           other  relationship),  some  of  the  basic  obligations  under  the  MSCA-RISE  MGA  must  also  be 
           respected by the seconded staff members. 
               Main obligations (of the staff member): 
                      Comply with the arrangements related to the intellectual property rights  
                      Maintain confidentiality 
                      Ensure the visibility of EU funding 
                       Seconded staff members must acknowledge funding under the MSCA grant in publications, 
                       communications or patent applications. 
                      Complete and submit — at the end of the secondment — the evaluation questionnaire and 
                       — two years later — the follow-up questionnaire provided by the Agency.

                           38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results 
                           The beneficiaries must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
                           audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner. 
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
                            or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply. 
                          
                            Before  engaging  in  a  communication  activity  expected  to  have  a  mainstream  media  coverage  the 
                           beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52). 
                           38.1.2 Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem 
                           Unless the Agency requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
                           related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
                            and major results funded by the grant must: 
                                       (a) display the EU emblem and 
                                       (b) include the following text: 
                          
                                               For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
                                               and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number]." 
                                               For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
                                               project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
                                               under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number].” 
                           When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
                           For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
                            first obtaining approval from the Agency. 
                           This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
                           Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
                           or by any other means. 
                           […] 
                            
                                            
                         1. Communication activities (consortium) — Promoting the action — Mainstream 
                                media coverage 
                         For MSCA, the rules for promoting the action are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 38.1.1 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, the beneficiaries  must  inform  the  Agency  not  only  before  a  communication  activity 
                         expected to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
                         media  coverage  (i.e.  coverage  in  any  forms  of  media,  e.g. print,  TV,  radio  and  electronic, 
                         addressing a non-specialist, non-scientific audience, e.g. local, regional or national news). This

           allows  the  Agency  to  ensure  maximum  publicity  and  to  disseminate  the  coverage  further  —
           through social media, news updates, etc. 
            
           2. Visibility of EU funding 
           For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
           27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA). 
           In addition, the beneficiaries must make specific reference to the MSCA grant. Thus, the clause 
           acknowledging EU funding is slightly adapted.

                         What? MSCA-COFUND funds: 
                                          a regional, national or international doctoral or fellowship training programme for training, 
                                           mobility and career development of researchers (— implemented by the beneficiary or a 
                                           partner organisation). 
                         MSCA-COFUND  cover  doctoral  programmes  for  early-stage  researchers  (DP)  and  fellowship 
                         programmes for experienced researchers (FP). 
                         MSCA-COFUND are mono-beneficiary actions. 
                         They are funded under Part I of Horizon 2020, ‘Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions’ (e.g. H2020-
                         MSCA-COFUND-2014).

                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down for the beneficiary, by budget 
                           category (see Articles 5, 6).  
                           4.2 Budget transfers

                         1. Budget categories 
                         The MSCA-COFUND MGA does not use the budget categories of the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the MSCA-COFUND MGA:  
                                                  costs for researchers:  
                                                                    costs for researchers in programmes implemented by the beneficiary 
                                                                    costs  of  providing  financial  support  to  costs  for  researchers  in  programmes 
                                                                     implemented by a partner organisation 
                                                  management costs. 
                          
                                        The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                                 5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4). 
                                  
                                          . 
                         2. Budget transfers 
                                           
                         Given  that  MSCA-COFUND is a mono-beneficiary action, there  is  NO  redistribution  of  person-
                                  
                         months between beneficiaries. 
                                  
                         Transfers between budget categories are formally NOT possible because all budget categories are 
                         linked  to  the  same  person-months  declared  for  the  recruited  researchers  (and  it  is  therefore 
                                  
                         technically not possible to move budgeted amounts from one budget category to another). 
                                  
                                        Budget flexibility — There is however some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                                                  The management unit cost should be shared with partner organisations which incurred costs for the 
                                                   implementation of a programme or for hosting secondments (see Article 8). 
                                                  The management unit cost should be used for the management of the action, but unused amounts 
                                                   may also be used for other action-related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researchers).

                            grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                          
                            The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                          
                            Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared under the following form (‘form of costs’):

                                  For MSCA-COFUND, these are unit costs for: 
                                                  costs for researchers: living allowance 
                                                  management costs. 
                         These  are  fixed  amounts  that  must  be  multiplied  by  the  number  of  months  the  recruited 
                         researchers spent on research training activities (person-months); they cannot be changed. 
                         The eligibility conditions are set out in Article 6.

                           5.3  Final grant amount — Calculation 
                         MSCA COFUND > Chapter 3 > Article 5.3 
                           The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                             with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in 
                           the following steps:  
                                      Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs  
                                      Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                      Step 3 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                           5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                           The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to eligible costs (unit costs; see Article 6) declared by 
                             the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21). 
                          
                             5.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                          
                             If the amount obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1, it 
                           will be limited to the latter. 
                           5.3.3 Step 3 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of 
                           obligations — Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation 
                           If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximum grant amount by 
                             deducting  the  amount  of  the  reduction  (calculated  in  proportion  to  the  seriousness  of  the  errors, 
                           irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
                             amount set out in Article 5.1. 
                           The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                                       -       the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 or  
                          
                                       -       the reduced maximum grant amount following Step 3.  
                            
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For MSCA, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the same as in the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since MSCA grants use only unit costs, there is NO reduction due to the no-profit rule in 
                         the MSCA MGAs (Step 3 in the Article 5.3 General MGA).

                           6.1 General conditions for costs to be eligible  
                           Unit costs are eligible (‘eligible costs’), if: 
                           (a) they are calculated as follows: 
                                              {amounts per unit set out in Annex 2 
                                              multiplied by  
                                              the number of actual units}; 
                           (b) the number of actual units complies with the following conditions: 
                                              -        the units must be actually used or produced in the period set out in Article 3; 
                                              -        the units must be necessary for implementing the action or produced by it, and 
                                              -        the number of units must be identifiable and verifiable, in particular supported by records and 
                                                       documentation (see Article 18). 
                             
                          
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs 
                         The grant can only reimburse eligible costs (i.e. costs that comply with the general and specific 
                         conditions set out in this Article) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’). 
                                           
                                              ONLY eligible  costs  may be entered  into  the  estimated  budget  for  the  action  (see  Article  4)  or 
                                           
                                       declared in the financial statements (see Article 20). 
                                       Record-keeping & burden of proof — The burden of proof for eligibility is on the beneficiary. It must 
                                           
                                       keep sufficient supporting documents (see Article 18) to show that the person-months it declares are 
                                       eligible.  
                                           
                                       Compliance with eligibility rules may be subject to a check or audit by the Commission/Agency. Any 
                                           
                                       ineligible costs found will be rejected (see Article 42).

                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The MSCA MGAs have their own budget categories, with their own types of costs, eligibility 
                         conditions and calculation rules. 
                         For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise — for each budget category 
                         — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                          types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                          cost form under which the costs must be declared (for MSCA: unit costs)  
                                          eligibility conditions 
                                          how the costs must be calculated.

                                        Budget flexibility — There is NO flexibility as regards the use of the researcher unit cost (i.e. living 
                                   allowance). It must be fully used for each researcher; it can NOT be used to pay other researchers or other 
                                   types of costs (see Article 15).  
                                    
                          
                                    
                         What not? Other costs of the beneficiary are not covered. Management costs are covered under 
                         budget category B ‘management costs’ (see Article 6.2.B). Other costs (such as mobility and 
                                    
                         family allowances, research, training and networking costs, indirect costs) are NOT eligible under 
                                    
                         the grant; they may be funded through other sources (including other EU programmes).

                                         Combining H2020 & other EU grants — A MSCA-COFUND grant does NOT prevent the beneficiary or 
                                   partner organisations from applying for further (non-H2020) EU funding for their programme — for costs

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019              MSCA-COFUND MGA 
                           for  experienced  researchers  in  fellowship  programmes:  EUR  5  480  per  person-
                            month. 
                   The unit cost that the beneficiary receives is however EUR 1 935 and EUR 2 740 respectively (because of 
                the MSCA COFUND reimbursement rate).  
                   For the latest information on the amounts, see the H2020 Work Programme (section 3 MSCA) in force at 
                the time of the call. 
                 
            In  practice,  the  declaration  of  costs  for  MSCA  grants  is  very  simple  and  almost  completely 
                 
            automatized: The beneficiary must only indicate the number of implemented person-months (for 
                 
            researchers recruited under the action) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT 
                 
            system.  
                 
            1.3  Moreover,  the  costs  (in  practice  for  MSCA:  the  person-months)  must  fulfil  the  following 
            eligibility conditions: 
                    . 
                   fulfil  the  general  conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. the declared number of 
                     
                    person-months must be linked to the implementation of the action, be incurred during the 
                    action duration, be identifiable and verifiable, etc.; see Article 6.1) 
                 
                   fulfil the additional cost eligibility conditions set out in Article 15.1.1. 
                 
            1.4 The costs are calculated (automatically by the IT system) as follows: 
                 
                   for the living allowance: 
                    amount per unit (see Annex 2)  x  number of months actually spent by the recruited researchers on the 
                    research training activities (‘number of implemented person-months’) 
            For partial months of recruitment, a pro-rata unit cost of 1/30 will be reimbursed for each day 
            (for ease of implementation, each month is considered to have 30 days).  
                    Example: If the researcher spent 20 months and 15 days on the project, the calculation for the 15 days is:  
                    15/30 = 0.5. In this case, insert 20.5 as number of person-months. 
            Periods in which a researcher was absent for more than 30 consecutive days (for reasons other 
            than normal annual leave) can NOT be charged to the action (and must be removed from the 
            financial statement, by changing the researcher declaration). 
                    Examples:  
                    1. If the researcher is absent for 30 consecutive days (or less), the costs incurred during this period can be 
                    charged to the action.  
                    2. If the researcher is absent for 31 consecutive days (or more), no costs can be charged for this period 
                    (from the first day of the absence)

                         1.1 What? This budget category covers only the: 
                                     management costs (B) — for direct costs of managing the action. 
                          
                                         Project management — Coordination and administration tasks are considered action tasks. 
                                         Budget flexibility — There is some flexibility as regards the use of the amounts received: 
                                                    The management unit cost should be shared with partner organisations which incurred costs for the 
                                                     implementation of a programme or for hosting secondments (see Article 8). 
                                                    The management unit cost should be used for the management of the action, but unused amounts 
                                                     may be used for other action-related purposes (e.g. to increase the salary of the researchers). 
                                    
                                    
                         What not? Other costs (such as research, training and networking costs AND indirect costs) are 
                                    
                         NOT eligible under the grant; they may be funded through OTHER sources (including other EU

                                       The  unit  cost  that  the  beneficiary  receives  is  however  EUR  325  (because  of  the  MSCA  COFUND 
                                  reimbursement rate).

                         1.3 The eligibility of the management costs is directly linked to (and conditional on) the eligibility 
                         of the costs for researchers. 
                                          . 
                                  Management costs are eligible only if ALL the eligibility conditions for the researchers are met.

                              ‘Ineligible costs’ are: 
                                       (a)  costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (in Article 6.1 and 6.2);

                           ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                        IN THE ACTION  
                           The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
                                     -        call  upon  partner  organisations  to  implement  certain  action  tasks  described  in  Annex  1 
                                              (i.e. implementing a doctoral or fellowship programme including recruiting researchers or hosting 
                                              and training researchers during a secondment). 
                           In this case, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action.

                                parties involved in the action 
                         For MSCA actions, the rules from the General MGA for third party involvement do not apply. 
                         Instead, MSCA-COFUND allows the beneficiary to use: 
                                          partner organisations 
                         to carry out work under the action (third parties involved in the action).  
                                              A beneficiary using third parties remains fully responsible for them under the GA. 
                                                Best  practice:  In  order  to  be  able  to  fulfil  this  obligation,  the  beneficiary  should  make  internal 
                                                arrangements (e.g. conclude partnership agreements with partner organisations). 
                                                 
                         Third parties involved in the action do not sign the GA (see Article1 H2020 General MGA). 
                                        
                         Their costs are considered already covered by the unit cost paid to the beneficiary; no additional 
                                        
                         costs will be reimbursed by the Agency. (The beneficiary is however encouraged to share the unit 
                                        
                         costs received with them.) 
                                        
                         Partner organisations are third parties involved in the action without a (capital or legal) link to 
                         the beneficiary.  
                                        
                         They may be used to: 
                                          implement a doctoral or fellowship programme (i.e. recruit the researchers) 
                                          provide training and hosting of researchers during a secondment (see Article 15).

                     Secondments — For MSCA-COFUND, secondments can be: 
                       (optional) additional periods of research training with a partner organisation, in order to further 
                        enrich the training experience of the researchers 
                  and/or  
                         for fellowship programmes similar to MSCA-IF GF: (mandatory) outgoing phase with a partner 
                          organisation (from a third country). 
                  The beneficiary remains fully responsible for the action implementation (in accordance with the GA) 
                  also during secondments. 
                   
            Partner organisations can recruit the researchers (and MUST do so if it is the partner organisation 
                   
            that implements the doctoral or fellowship programme; see Article 15.1.1(b)).  
                   
            Their involvement must be clearly described in Annex 1 (in particular, tasks to be carried out). 
                   
            They cannot claim costs separately (since their costs are covered by the unit costs paid to the 
            beneficiary).  
            Partner organisations that implement a doctoral or fellowship programme must be established in 
            an EU Member State, H2020 associated country, or third country listed in General Annex A to the 
            H2020  Work  Programme.  Partner  organisations  hosting  secondments  can  be  established 
            anywhere.

                       pension rights and 
                       benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. 
                If  national  law  prevents  them  from  recruiting  researchers  under  an  employment 
                contract/equivalent direct contract, the beneficiary/partner organisation may — exceptionally 
                and  subject  to  the  Agency’s  prior  agreement  —  offer  a  fixed-amount  fellowship  with 
                minimum social security coverage, including: 
                          sickness, parental and invalidity benefits and  
                          benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases. 
                       In this case, the living allowance will be reduced by 50%. 
               The social security coverage must be guaranteed for the entire recruitment of the researcher 
               (i.e. also during secondments, if any). 
               Staff provided by a temporary work agency — The beneficiary/partner organisation must 
               always  recruit  researchers  directly.  Recruitments  via  other  means  (e.g.  temporary  work 
               agency) are NOT allowed.  
            The researchers must be recruited for at least 3 months. 
            Researchers recruited under an employment contract/equivalent direct contract must receive a 
            minimum remuneration — monthly living allowance (i.e. gross amount including salary, social 
            security contributions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration) and, if applicable, a 
            single mobility allowance for the researcher to take up the doctoral or fellowship programme (to 
            be funded through other sources) — of: 
                  for early-stage researchers (doctoral programmes): EUR 2 709  
                  for experienced researchers (fellowship programmes): EUR 3 836.  
               These amounts are halved for fixed-amount fellowship agreements (i.e. for early stage 
               researchers EUR 1 354,50; for experienced researchers EUR 1 918). 
               Lower payments are considered as underpayment. 
                 
                    Since the MSCA-COFUND grant reimburses 50% of the researcher unit cost (i.e. EUR 1 935 and EUR 2 
                 740  respectively),  this  means  that  the  grant  covers  only  a  part  of  the  minimum  remuneration.  The 
                 beneficiary must bear (‘co-fund’) the difference of EUR 774 or EUR 1096 per researcher.  
                 It  also  means that there can be NO budget flexibility. The researcher unit cost must have been fully 
                 incurred for the benefit of the researcher (i.e. fully paid to the individual for whom they are claimed). There 
                can be no amounts left (which the beneficiary could use for other action-related activities).  
                  
                 
               The total cost of the doctoral/fellowship programme, in particular the amounts to be provided 
               for the benefit of the researchers and for the hosting organisation, must be specified in Annex 
                  
               1. 
                 
                  
               A beneficiary with accounting in a currency other than the euro must ensure that — by the 
               end  of  the  doctoral/fellowship  programme  —  the  average  monthly  allowance  (over  the 
                     . 
               duration of the programme) respects the above-mentioned minimum. 
                      
                    Amounts to be paid in other currencies must be converted into euro as follows:  
                           if a daily rate is published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European 
                            Union for the currency in question: amounts must be converted into euro at the

                                average of the daily exchange rates published over the corresponding reporting 
                                                                                 110
                                period, as reported on the ECB website               
                               if  no  daily  rate is published: amounts must be converted at the average of the 
                                monthly accounting rates over the reporting period, using the currency converter 
                                                                    111
                                on the Commission’s website            . 
                       For  ease  of  implementation,  monthly  allowances  for  the  recruited  researchers  can  be 
                       calculated using a conservative exchange rate, if a corrective payment is then made (to 
                       the researchers) immediately after the end of the reporting period. This must be clearly 
                       explained  in  the  employment  contract/equivalent  direct  contract  or  fixed-amount-
                       fellowship agreement. 
                       The  Agency  will  check  if  the  living  allowance  was  used  fully  for  the  benefit  of  the 
                       researchers. Any underpayments, if not corrected, may lead to a rejection of costs (for 
                       that researcher). 
             Recruited researchers should not have to bear any costs for the implementation of the action as 
             described in Annex 1. 
                  For doctoral programmes: recruited researchers must NOT be requested to pay visa-related 
                  fees  or  tuition  fees  for  their  research  training  and/or  PhD  programme  (e.g.  student 
                  registration,  access  to  student  services  (library,  computing,  etc.),  teaching,  supervision, 
                  examination and graduation) neither from their own funds, nor from the researcher unit cost. 
                  For fellowship programmes: the recruited researchers must NOT be requested to pay visa-
                  related fees or tuition fees for their research training neither from their own funds, nor from 
                  the researcher unit cost. 
              
             5. ‘Other obligations’ 
             In addition to the additional cost eligibility conditions in Article 15.1.1, the beneficiary/partner 
             organisation must comply with the following ‘other obligations’: 
                      the researchers must: 
                               be employed full-time, unless duly justified for reasons associated with personal 
                                or family reasons. 
                                This also means that a researcher can NOT benefit from two MSCA grants at the 
                                same time. 
                                Part-time employment can be accepted: 
                                        subject to prior approval by the Agency 
                                        on personal and family grounds only (i.e. NOT for professional reasons) and 
                                        if limited to a maximum of 50% of the time spent under the action. 
                                In the case of part-time employment, costs are reported as pro-rata of the full-time 
                                unit cost. 
                                     Example: For one month of 50% part-time employment, 0.5 units should be claimed.  
                                      While it is not possible to request part-time employment for professional reasons, the 
                                   beneficiary may — in exceptional cases — request an interruption of the employment. If the 
                                   Agency  agrees  (beforehand  and  in  writing),  there  is  no  need  for  an  amendment  or  GA 
                                   suspension; it is sufficient NOT to declare the months not worked.

                         appropriate and sufficient evidence to prove that the person-months declared are correct, i.e.: 
                                                  the  employment  contracts  (or  other  suitable  documents,  e.g. fixed-fellowship

                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. 
                         It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (3 years for grants up 
                         to  EUR  60 000)  or  longer  if  there  are  ongoing  procedures  (such  as  audits,  investigations  or 
                         litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until they end. 
                                   Costs that are not supported by appropriate and sufficient evidence may be rejected (and other measures 
                            described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

                           19.1               Obligation to submit deliverables 
                           The beneficiary must 
                                    -        submit a ‘researcher declaration’ within 20 days of the start of the research training activities, for 
                                             each researcher; 
                                    -        organise a 'mid-term meeting' with the Agency; 
                                    -        submit any other deliverables identified in Annex 1, in accordance with the timing and conditions 
                                             set out in it.   
                          
                           19.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If  the  beneficiary  breaches  any  of  its  obligations  under  this  Article,  the  Agency  may  apply  any  of  the 
                            measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Deliverable: Researcher declaration 
                         What & When? The beneficiary must submit to the Agency a researcher declaration for each 
                         recruited  researcher  —  within  20  days  of  the  start  of  the  research  training  activities  of  the 
                         researcher. 
                                  It is important to give correct and complete information in the researcher declaration since the 
                                  data will be automatically transmitted to Annex 4 (financial statement), for calculating the 
                                  living allowance units. If the researcher declaration is not provided, it will NOT be possible to 
                                  declare person-months for that researcher. 
                         How? The researcher declarations must be prepared and submitted directly in the Funding & 
                         Tenders Portal. 
                          
                         2. Deliverable: Mid-term meeting  
                         What & When? The beneficiary must organise a mid-term meeting with the Agency to present 
                         the implementation of the action in the light of the schedule in Annex 1. 
                                  Best practice: Please contact the Agency for the timing.

                         1. Access rights for the researcher 
                         In view of the key role of the recruited researchers in MSCA-COFUND, the MSCA-COFUND MGA 
                         foresees special access rights for them (in addition to those of the General MGA; see Articles 25 
                         and 31 H2020 General MGA): 
                         The beneficiary must give the recruited researchers access to both background AND results 
                         necessary for their research training activities. 
                                  ‘Background’  means  any  data,  know-how  or  information  —  whatever  its  form  or  nature 
                                  (tangible or intangible), including any rights such as intellectual property rights — that: 
                                                  is held by the beneficiary before it accedes to the GA (i.e. before grant signature) 
                                                  is needed to implement the action or exploit the results  
                                           AND that 
                                                  has been identified by the beneficiary in accordance with Article 24.  
                                  ‘Results’ means any (tangible or intangible) output of the action, such as data, knowledge or 
                                  information — whatever its form or nature, whether it can be protected or not — that is 
                                  generated in the action as well as any rights attached to it, including intellectual property 
                                  rights. 
                         The beneficiary must moreover ensure that partner organisations (if any) give similar access.

                           38.1.1 Obligation to promote the action and its results 
                           The beneficiary must promote the action and its results, by providing targeted information to multiple 
                           audiences (including the media and the public) in a strategic and effective manner. 
                           This does not change the dissemination obligations in Article 29, the confidentiality obligations in Article 36 
                            or the security obligations in Article 37, all of which still apply. 
                          
                           Before  engaging  in  a  communication  activity  expected  to  have  a  mainstream  media  coverage  the 
                            beneficiaries must inform the Agency (see Article 52). 
                           38.1.2  Information on EU funding — Obligation and right to use the EU emblem 
                           Unless the Agency requests or agrees otherwise or unless it is impossible, any communication activity 
                           related to the action (including in electronic form, via social media, etc.) and any infrastructure, equipment 
                            and major results funded by the grant must: 
                                        (a) display the EU emblem and 
                                        (b) include the following text: 
                          
                                               For communication activities: "This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research 
                                               and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number]." 
                                               For infrastructure, equipment and major results: “This [infrastructure][equipment][insert type of result] is part of a 
                                               project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
                                               under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No [number].” 
                           When displayed together with another logo, the EU emblem must have appropriate prominence.  
                           For the purposes of their obligations under this Article, the beneficiaries may use the EU emblem without 
                            first obtaining approval from the Agency. 
                           This does not, however, give them the right to exclusive use.  
                           Moreover, they may not appropriate the EU emblem or any similar trademark or logo, either by registration 
                           or by any other means. 
                           […]

                                media coverage 
                         For MSCA, the rules for promoting the action are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 38.1.1 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However,  the  beneficiary  must  inform  the  Agency  not  only  before  a  communication  activity 
                         expected to have a major media impact, but before any activity expected to have mainstream 
                         media  coverage  (i.e.  coverage  in  any  forms  of  media,  e.g. print,  TV,  radio  and  electronic,

            addressing a non-specialist, non-scientific audience, e.g. local, regional or national news). This 
            allows  the  Agency  to  ensure  maximum  publicity  and  to  disseminate  the  coverage  further  —
            through social media, news updates, etc. 
             
            2. Visibility of EU funding 
            For MSCA, the same rules on visibility of EU funding apply as in the General MGA (see Articles 
            27.3, 28.2, 29.4 and 38.1.2 H2020 General MGA). 
            In addition, the beneficiary must make specific reference to the MSCA grant. Thus, the clause 
            acknowledging EU funding is slightly adapted.

                         1. Linked grant 
                         MSCA-SNLS grants are always linked to another MSCA grant of the beneficiary (main grant – IF, 
                         ITN, RISE or Cofund).  
                         The MSCA-SNLS provides support only to researchers or staff members with disabilities who are 
                         eligible under the linked MSCA GA. 
                         Moreover, the MSCA-SNLS grant shares the fate of the main grant (e.g. if the main grant is

             ARTICLE 2 — ACTION TO BE IMPLEMENTED  
             The grant is awarded for the acquisition of the special needs items or services described in Annex 1, which 
             are needed to allow the concerned researcher or staff member to participate in the linked grant (‘action’). 
               
              
                     
            2. Action: MSCA-SNLS 
            What? MSCA-SNLS grants fund additional costs that MSCA researchers and staff members with 
            disabilities face due to the increased costs of their mobility during another MSCA action (main 
            grant).  
            MSCA-SNLS is awarded for the acquisition of special needs items or services (e.g. assistance by 
            third persons, adaptation of work environment, additional travel/transportation costs) to allow the 
            recruited or seconded researcher/staff member to participate in the main MSCA action. 
            What not? Additional costs entailed by the recruited or seconded researcher/staff member but 
            already covered by another source (e.g. social security or health insurance) cannot be funded 
            under the MSCA-SNLS.

                              ARTICLE  4  —  ESTIMATED  LUMP  SUM  BREAKDOWN  AND  LUMP  SUM  SHARE 
                                                                        TRANSFERS  
                              4.1 Estimated lump sum breakdown  
                              The ‘estimated lump sum breakdown’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
                              It contains the lump sum shares, per work package (i.e. special needs items or services).  
                              The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
                              beneficiary. It shows the amounts that the Agency commits to pay if the action is implemented properly, 
                              regardless of the costs actually incurred. 
                              4.2 Lump sum share transfers  
                              The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 cannot be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
                              work packages (not even via an amendment; see Article 55). 
                               
                          
                                            
                         1. Estimated lump sum breakdown  
                         Since MSCA-SNLS grants do not use eligible costs, the MSCA-SNLS MGA does not have any budget 
                         categories. Instead, it has either a single lump sum or, if several special needs items or services 
                         are needed, a lump sum breakdown.  
                         For technical reasons, each item or service must be considered a separate work package.  
                         The breakdown is used to determine: 
                                     the share of the lump sum to which the beneficiary is entitled for each work package.  
                                     the maximum amount of grant reduction that can be applied for improper implementation 
                                            of a work package.  
                                           Example: Annex 2 sets out EUR 10 000 for work package 1 (WP1) – Special assistance services for the 
                                           entire action duration (12 months). The Agency carries out a review on the grant and concludes that WP1 
                                           was not properly implemented because only part of the activities of that work package were actually carried 
                                           out (i.e. assistance was provided for 11 months instead of 12 months). The Agency will reduce the grant in 
                                           proportion to the improper implementation of WP1 up to a maximum of EUR 10 000 (the share of the lump 
                                           sum allocated to that work package).  
                          
                         2. Lump sum share transfers 
                         Given  that  MSCA-SNLS  is  a  mono-beneficiary  action,  there  is  NO  redistribution  between 
                         beneficiaries.  
                         Transfers between work packages are NOT possible, because the lump sum shares have been 
                         fixed for each special needs item or service.

                              ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
                              5.1 Maximum grant amount  
                              The ‘maximum grant amount’ is EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)].  
                              5.2 Form of grant  
                              The grant takes the form of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action. 
                               
                                            
                         1. Grant amount and form of grant  
                         How much & which form? The MSCA-SNLS MGA does not use the cost forms of the General 
                         MGA, but is a lump sum grant.  
                                  The use of the lump sum is set out in the H2020 Work Programme (section 3 MSCA).  
                                  The lump sum will be fixed taking into account the H2020 MSCA funding rates. This means 
                                  that the lump sum fixed in Article 5 does not have to be multiplied again by the funding rate; 
                                  it is already the net maximum EU funding.  
                                  The lump sum is one amount for the entire action. It will be limited to a maximum of EUR 
                                  60 000 per researcher/staff member and will be available as of 2019. 
                         There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is correctly implemented, the beneficiary is 
                         entitled to receive the lump sum fixed in the GA. 
                          
                                   The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs and cannot be increased.

                            5.3 Final grant amount — Calculation  
                            The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                            with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
                            This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in 
                            the following steps:  
                                             Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of non-
                                                                  approved work packages  
                                             Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                            5.3.1 Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of 
                            non-approved work packages  
                            The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
                            beneficiary are added together.  
                            The grant is reduced (see Article 43) for all other work packages (i.e. all work packages that have not been 
                            delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance). 
                            5.3.2  Step  2  —  Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                            obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation  
                            If  the  grant  is  further  reduced  (due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                            obligations other than improper implementation; see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced grant 
                            amount by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
                            irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
                            amount set out in Article 5.1.  
                            The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                                    ­  the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
                                    ­  the reduced grant amount following Step 2. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For MSCA-SNLS grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same as for the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21). 
                         Moreover, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared cannot be higher than the 
                         amount fixed in Annex 2 anyways), there is NO need to calculate the: 
                                                    limit to the maximum grant amount or  
                                                    reduction due to the no-profit rule.

                           If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
                             Article 22) — the Agency reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
                           breach of obligations including improper implementation); see Article 43), it will calculate the ‘revised 
                             final grant amount’. 
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency by reducing the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
                           irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations (see Article 43.2).

                         For MSCA-SNLS grants, the rules on the revised final grant amount are also in principle the same 
                         as for the General MGA (see Article 5.4 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21).

                             ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                IN THE ACTION  
                             The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                             If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
                                      -        purchase goods, works and services ;  
                                      -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1;  
                             in accordance with the specific rules set out in Article 10 to 14a. 
                             In these cases, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Third parties involved in the action 
                         For MSCA-SNLS actions, NEITHER the rules from the General MGA NOR from the MSCA main grant 
                         for third party involvement apply. 
                         There are NO special rules for purchases or subcontracting. The beneficiary may make purchases 
                         or subcontract tasks if this is needed for the special needs items or services. 
                          
                                     For all types of third party involvement (purchases and/or subcontracts), the costs are ALL covered by 
                              the lump sum. NO other costs will be reimbursed.

                             ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION  
                             18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation  
                             The beneficiary must — for a period of three years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate 
                             records and other supporting documentation to prove the proper implementation of the action.  
                             It must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                             investigations (see Article 22). 
                             If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                             Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiary must keep the records and 
                             other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures.  
                             The  beneficiary  must  keep  the  original  documents.  Digital  and  digitalised  documents  are  considered 
                             originals  if  they  are  authorised  by  the  applicable  national  law.  The  Agency  may  accept  non-original 
                             documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance.  
                             Records and other supporting documentation on the implementation of the action must be in line with the 
                             accepted standards in the respective filed.  
                             The beneficiary does not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the action. 
                             18.2 Consequences of non-compliance  
                             If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
                             43).  
                             Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                                            
                         1. Records and other supporting documentation  
                         For MSCA-SNLS actions, the beneficiary does not need to keep full records on its actual costs; it  
                         only needs to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation, records) that the special 
                         needs items or services were provided to the researcher/staff member as described in Annex 1.  
                         The records and supporting documentation must also prove that:  
                                          the eligibility conditions for the researcher/staff member as per MSCA main grant were 
                                           complied with  
                                          the special need(s) of the researcher/staff member was certified by a competent national 
                                           authority. 
                         By contrast, timesheets or invoices are NOT needed. The evidence must be verifiable, auditable 
                         and available. It must be correctly archived — for at least 3 years (because not above 60 000 
                         EUR)  after  the  balance  is  paid  or  longer  if  there  are  ongoing  procedures  (such  as  audits, 
                         investigations or litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until they end. 
                          
                                     If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
                               reduced (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

                             The beneficiary must submit to the Agency (see Article 52) the technical and financial reports set out in 
                             this Article. These reports include the request for payment and must be drawn up using the forms and

                             The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days following the end of the reporting period — a final report.  
                             The final report must include the following:  
                                 (a) a ‘final technical report’ containing:  
                                           (i) an overview of the results.  
                                                  This report must include explanations justifying the differences between work expected to be 
                                                  carried out in accordance with Annex 1 and that actually carried out.  
                                           (ii) a summary for publication by the Agency: not applicable;  
                                           (iii) the answers to the ‘questionnaire’: not applicable; 
                                 (b) a ‘final financial report’ containing a ‘financial statement’ (see Annex 4) which       includes the 
                                        request for payment of the balance.  
                                        The  financial  statement  must  declare  the  lump  sum  shares  indicated  in  Annex  2,  for  the  work 
                                        packages that were completed.  
                                        If agreed by the Agency, the beneficiary may exceptionally also declare work packages that were not 
                                        completed.  
                                        Lump sum shares which are not declared in the financial statement will not be taken into account by 
                                        the Agency. 
                                        The beneficiary must certify that:  
                                               -        the information provided is full, reliable and true;  
                                               -        the  work packages have been completed and that the action in general has been properly 
                                                        implemented (see Article 7);

                      -   the  proper  implementation  can  be  substantiated  by  adequate  records  and  supporting 
                          documentation (see Article 18) that will be produced upon request (see Article 17) or in the

              20.5 Information on cumulative expenditure incurred  
              Not applicable 
              […] 
             
                     
            1. Reports 
            What & When? For MSCA-SNLS actions, the beneficiary must submit a final periodic report at 
            the end of the action. 
            Each report is composed of a technical and a financial report, however, the financial report is not 
            to declare costs but completed work packages  and corresponding lump sum shares (one or more, 
            depending on the number of special needs items or services which are covered by the grant). 
            In principle, lump sum shares should be claimed only for special needs items and services that 
            were fully provided to the researcher/staff member concerned. However, if agreed by the Agency, 
            the beneficiary may exceptionally declare partial lump sum shares for work packages that were 
            not completed, for example, due to technical reasons or reasons related to the researcher/staff 
            member.  
            Best  practice:  In  case  of  doubt,  the  beneficiary  should  contact  the  Agency  about  partial  work 
            packages. 
                    The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if: 
                       the situation could have been solved via an amendment.  
                        Example: The beneficiary argues that it did not have enough time to complete the WP. The duration of 
                        the action could have been extended via an amendment for the beneficiary to have enough time. 
                       non-implementation linked to financial reasons 
                        Example: The special needs service turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
                        beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned.

                                      -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
                                               20).  
                             21.2 Pre-financing payment — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund  
                             [OPTION 1 by default: The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float.  
                             It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance.  
                             The amount of the pre-financing payment will be EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                             The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre-financing payment to the beneficiary within 
                             30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 days before the 
                             starting date of the action (see Article 3) whichever is the latest.  
                             An amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
                             amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency from the pre-financing payment and transferred into the 
                             ‘Guarantee Fund’.] 
                             [OPTION 2 if the JRC is the beneficiary: The Agency will make a pre-financing payment of EUR [insert 
                             amount including the 5% to be paid to the Guarantee Fund (insert amount in words)], within 30 days 
                             from the submission of a debit note from the JRC after the signature of the ‘Arrangement’.  
                             The JRC agrees that the amount of EUR [insert amount: 5% of the grant amount intended for the JRC 
                             (insert amount in words)], corresponding to its contribution to the Guarantee Fund (see Article 21.2), is 
                             transferred in its name by the Agency to the Guarantee Fund.]  
                             21.3 Interim payments — Amount — Calculation  
                             Not applicable  
                             21.4 Payment of the balance — Amount — Calculation — Release of the amount retained for the 
                             Guarantee Fund 
                             The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the 
                             action.  
                             If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
                             of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
                             If  the  total  amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency will pay the 
                             balance within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                             Payment is subject to the approval of the final report and the lump sum shares and work packages declared. 
                             Their approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of 
                             their content.

             Incomplete work packages, and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be approved will 
             reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).  
             The amount due as the balance is calculated by the Agency by deducting the total amount of pre-financing 
             already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3:  
                     {final grant amount (see Article 5.3)  
                     minus  
                     pre-financing made}.  
             At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released and: 
                 -   if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the beneficiary together with 
                     the amount due as the balance; 
                 -   if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
                     from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount:  
                         -   is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary  
                         -   is negative, it will be recovered.  
             The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiary’s consent — against any other 
             amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the EU 
             or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated lump 
             sum breakdown (see Annex 2). 
             […] 
             
                     
            1. Payments to be made 
            MSCA-SNLS actions have only one reporting period (see Article 20.2), with one pre-financing 
            payment. 
            There are NO interim payments. 
            The balance is paid when the action ends. 
                 
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
            Payment of the balance 
            How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
            be calculated by the Agency on the basis of the financial statement, the final grant amount and 
            the payments already made. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.3, 21.4 and 44.1.2 H2020 General MGA), 
            however with the following specificities: 
            Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
            eligible costs, but simply sums up all the lump sum shares for the accepted work packages. Partial 
            work  packages  can  exceptionally  be  accepted  (i.e.  shares  for  work  packages  that  were  not

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                 MSCA-SNLS MGA 
            completed,  for  example  due  to  technical  reasons  or  reasons  related  to  the  researcher/staff 
            member). 
                Examples:  
                1. The beneficiary of an ongoing MSCA-SNLS GA cannot complete the pending work packages because the 
                person providing assistance to the MSCA-RISE staff member with special mobility needs is no longer able to 
                provide the service and the staff member in question does not want to replace his/her assistant. Therefore, the 
                beneficiary requests termination of the MSCA-SNLS GA. The Agency decides to accept part of the lump sum 
                shares for the uncompleted work packages that is proportionate to the tasks already carried out under the 
                MSCA-SNLS action. 
                2. The participation of an early-stage researcher (ESR) with physical impairment has been terminated in the 
                linked MSCA-ITN GA due to personal circumstances of the researcher (e.g. another professional opportunity). 
                Given that the grounds for termination of the MSCA-SNLS are not linked to the beneficiary, the Agency decides 
                to exceptionally accept partial work packages that were initiated but could not be fully completed. The Agency 
                will however verify if the reported lump sum shares for the uncompleted work packages are proportionate to the 
                tasks carried out. 
                    The Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares if: 
                       the situation could have been solved via an amendment.  
                        Example: The beneficiary argues that it did not have enough time to complete the WP. The duration of 
                        the action could have been extended via an amendment for the beneficiary to have enough time. 
                       non-implementation linked to financial reasons 
                        Example: The special needs service  turned out to be more expensive than initially expected and the 
                        beneficiary decided to provide less support than planned. 
             
            Steps 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
            do not apply to MSCA-SNLS grants. 
            Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other than non-implementation 
            (because non-implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
            All other steps follow the General MGA. 
             
            Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount 
            The amount to be recovered (or paid) after the final payment will be calculated by the Agency on 
            the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.4 and 44.1.3 H2020 General MGA), 
            however with the following specificities: 
            Step  1  (Re-calculation  of  the  accepted  EU  contribution)  does  not  apply;  only  Step  4  (Grant 
            reductions) applies.  
            All other steps follow the General MGA.

                              reviews on the proper implementation of the action (including assessment of deliverables and reports),

                              audits  on  the  proper  implementation  of  the  action  and  compliance  with  the  obligations  under  the

                         1. Checks, reviews and audits 
                         The rules on checks, reviews and audits are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 22 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since MSCA-SNLS grants do not use eligible costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
                                         there will be no financial checks, reviews, or audits to check costs (since the beneficiary 
                                          has  no  obligation  to  document  the  costs  incurred  for  the  action,  even  if  they  remain 
                                          subject to the accounting rules under the applicable national law).  
                                         checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the technical implementation of the action (in 
                                          particular  whether  the  special  needs  items  and  services    have  been  provided  to  the 
                                          researcher/staff member as described in Annex 1 of the GA). 
                         Specific cases (audits): 
                         Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Commission/Agency may also 
                         audit the accounting records of the beneficiary to obtain general information about real costs of cost 
                         items for which it has fixed unit costs, flat-rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data 
                         to assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for 
                         the beneficiary.

                             The Agency will — at the payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any amount that was 
                             paid, but is not due under the Agreement.

                             If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
                             notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the beneficiary:  
                                      -        informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                                      -        specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                                               Guarantee Fund; and  
                                      -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                             If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
                             received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and:

                                               Fund, if the difference is positive or  
                                      -        formally  notify  to  the  beneficiary  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                                               recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This note 
                                               will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
                             If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
                             the amount:  
                                      (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —  against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                                               beneficiary by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                                               budget).  
                                      In exceptional circumstances, to safeguard the EU’s financial interests, the Agency or the Commission 
                                      may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
                                      (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will formally notify the 
                                               beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:

                                               (ii) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 
                                               299  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  EU  (TFEU)  and  Article  79(2)  of  the  Financial

             If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
             increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the payment 
             date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment of 
             the amount.  
             Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
             the principal.  
             Bank  charges  incurred  in  the  recovery  process  will  be  borne  by  the  beneficiary,  unless  Directive 
             2007/64/EC12 applies.  
             44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance 
             If, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the beneficiary must 
             repay the difference to the Agency.  
             The Agency will formally notify a pre-information letter to the beneficiary: 
                 -   informing it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and  
                 -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
             If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
             received, it will confirm the amount to be recovered and formally notify to the beneficiary a debit note. 
             This note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
             If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
             the amount: 
                 (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —  against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                     beneficiary by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                     budget).  
                     In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  Agency  or  the 
                     Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
                 (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will formally notify the 
                     beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount:  
                     (i) not applicable;  
                     (ii) by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 
                     299  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  EU  (TFEU)  and  Article  79(2)  of  the  Financial

            The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 44 H2020 General MGA).  
            However, since for MSCA-SNLS grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different 
            (see Article 21).

                              SECTION 3 SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION  
                              ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE  
                              47.1 Conditions  
                              The Agency may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 21.4) if a request 
                              for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:  
                                      (a)  it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Article 20);  
                                      (b)  the technical or financial report has not been submitted or is not complete or additional information 
                                               is needed, or  
                                      (c)  there is doubt about the amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) 
                                               and additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary.  
                              47.2 Procedure  
                              The Agency will formally notify the beneficiary of the suspension and the reasons why.  
                              The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the Agency (see Article 52).  
                              If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
                              and the remaining period will resume.  
                              If  the  suspension  exceeds  two  months,  the  beneficiary  may  request  the  Agency  if  the  suspension  will 
                              continue. 
                              If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the technical or financial report 
                              (see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, 
                              the Agency may also terminate the Agreement (see Article 50.3.1(l)). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Suspension of the payment deadline (EU) 
                         The rules on the suspension of the payment deadline are in principle the same as in the General 
                         MGA (see Article 47 H2020 General MGA).  
                          
                         The MSCA-SNLS MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
                          
                         Since there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could be doubts, the suspension 
                         ground for MSCA-SNLS grants targets more generally any kinds of doubts about the amounts 
                         requested for payment (including doubts linked to work package implementation).

                         ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION 
                              ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
                              49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiary  
                              49.1.1 Conditions  
                              The beneficiary may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
                              — in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult. 
                              49.1.2 Procedure  
                              The beneficiary must immediately formally notify to the Agency the suspension (see Article 52), stating:  
                                       -        the reasons why and  
                                       -        the expected date of resumption.  
                              The suspension will take effect the day this notification is received by the Agency.  
                              Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the beneficiary must immediately formally notify 
                              the Agency and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which the action will be 
                              resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new 
                              situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement has been terminated (see Article 50). 
                              The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
                              This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
                              During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
                              work packages may be started.  
                              49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the Agency 
                              49.2.1 Conditions  
                              The Agency may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if:  
                                       (a)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                                has committed or is suspected of having committed:  
                                                (i) substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
                                                (ii) serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure (including 
                                                improper  implementation  of  the  action,  submission  of    false  information,  failure  to  provide 
                                                required information, breach of ethical principles);  
                                       (b)  the beneficiary or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                                has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions — 
                                                systemic or recurrent errors, irregularities, fraud or serious breach of obligations that have a 
                                                material impact on this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 
                                                22.5.2);

                  (c)  not applicable;  
                  (d)  the action implementation of the linked grant (see Article 2) is suspended.  
              49.2.2 Procedure  
              Before suspending implementation of the action, the Agency will formally notify the beneficiary:  
                  -   informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and  
                  -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If the Agency does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the observations it 
              has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the suspension. Otherwise, it will formally notify that 
              the procedure is not continued.  
              The suspension will take effect five days after confirmation notification is received by the beneficiary (or 
              on a later date specified in the notification).  
              It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met. 
              The beneficiary will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be amended to set the date 
              on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to 
              adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement has already been terminated 
              (see Article 50).  
              The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date may 
              be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
              During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
              work packages may be started.  
              The beneficiary may not claim damages due to suspension by the Agency (see Article 46).  
              Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the Agency’s right to terminate the Agreement (see 
              Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly paid (see Articles 43 and 44). 
             
                     
            1. GA suspension (consortium or EU) 
            The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 49 H2020 
            General MGA).  
            For full GA suspension (action is entirely suspended), all on-going work packages (i.e. special 
            needs items or services) must be interrupted and no new work packages may be started.  
            For partial GA suspensions (suspension of specific work package(s)),, other work packages may be 
            continued and new work packages may be started.

            2. GA suspension — Additional ground for suspension: Suspension of main grant 
               (EU) 
            In addition to the normal grounds for GA suspension (see Article 49 H2020 General MGA), the 
            Agency may suspend the MSCA-SNLS action if the main grant (to which the MSCA-SNLS grant is 
            linked) is suspended.   
                Example: The beneficiary of an ongoing MSCA-IF grant has requested GA suspension for family grounds of the 
                recruited  researcher  with  visual  impairment.  The  beneficiary  has  already  fully  adapted  the  main  work 
                environment but the adaptation of a small laboratory is still missing. The Agency will suspend the MSCA-SNLS 
                GA until the MSCA-IF action will be resumed.

                         ARTICLE 50 — TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT   
                             50.1 Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiary  
                             […] 
                             50.1.2 Effects  
                             The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
                             Article 20).  
                             If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no lump sum shares will be taken 
                             into account.  
                             The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21) on the 
                             basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only lump sum 
                             shares for work packages fully completed before termination will be accepted — unless exceptionally 
                             agreed otherwise by the Agency.  
                             Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
                             After termination, the beneficiary's obligations (in particular Article 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 43 and 44) 
                             continue to apply.  
                             50.2 Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries  
                             Not applicable 
                             50.3 Termination of the Agreement, by the Agency  
                             50.3.1 Conditions  
                             The Agency may terminate the Agreement if:  
                                      (a)  not applicable;  
                                      (b)  a change to the beneficiary’s legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation is 
                                               likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or calls into question the 
                                               decision to award the grant;  
                                      (c)  not applicable;  
                                      (d)  implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
                                               beneficiary (see Article 49.1) and either:  
                                               (i) resumption is impossible, or  
                                               (ii)  the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the 
                                               grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants;  
                                      (e)  the beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, 
                                               has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
                                               any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law;  
                                      (f)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                               has been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means;

              If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no lump sum shares will be taken 
              into account.  
              The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21) on the 
              basis of the report submitted and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement. Only lump sum 
              shares  for  work  packages  fully  completed  before  termination  will  be  accepted  —  unless  exceptionally 
              agreed otherwise by the Agency. 
              This does not affect the Agency’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative 
              sanctions (Article 45).  
              The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency (see Article 46). 
              After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 43 and 44) 
              continue to apply. 
             
                     
            1. GA termination  
            The rules on GA termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 50 H2020 
            General MGA). 
            However, since for MSCA-SNLS grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different 
            (see Article 21). 
                    
            2. GA termination — Additional ground for termination: Termination of main grant 
               or researcher/staff member's participation in main grant (EU) 
            In addition to the normal grounds for GA termination (see Article 50.3 H2020 General MGA), the 
            Agency may terminate the MSCA-SNLS action if the main grant  or the researcher/staff member's 
            participation in the main grant (to which the MSCA-SNLS grant is linked) is terminated. 
                Example: The beneficiary of MSCA-COFUND grant has committed substantial errors and irregularities and the 
                Agency has decided to terminate the GA. The MSCA-COFUND GA is linked to MSCA-SNLS GA which foresees the 
                construction of multiple ramps at the premises of the beneficiary to create an accessible work environment. The 
                termination of the MSCA-COFUND GA serves as a ground for termination of the MSCA-SNLS GA by the Agency.

                             ARTICLE 55 — AMENDMENTS TO THE AGREEMENT  
                             55.1 Conditions  
                             The Agreement may be amended, unless the amendment entails changes to the Agreement which would 
                             call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants.  
                             Amendments may be requested by any of the parties.  
                             55.2 Procedure  
                             The party requesting an amendment must submit a request for amendment signed in the electronic exchange 
                             system (see Article 52).  
                             The request for amendment must include:  
                                      -        the reasons why;  
                                      -        the appropriate supporting documents, and  
                             The Agency may request additional information.  
                             If the party receiving the request agrees, it must sign the amendment in the electronic exchange system 
                             within 45 days of receiving notification (or any additional information the Agency has requested). If it does 
                             not agree, it must formally notify its disagreement within the same deadline. The deadline may be extended, 
                             if necessary for the assessment of the request. If no notification is received within the deadline, the request 
                             is considered to have been rejected.  
                             An amendment enters into force on the day of the signature of the receiving party.  
                             An amendment takes effect on the date agreed by the parties or, in the absence of such an agreement, on 
                             the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                            
                              
                                            
                         1. Amendments  
                         The rules for amendments are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 55 H2020 General 
                         MGA). 
                         Given the parallelism of the MSCA-SNLS grants and the main grant, there may be a need to 
                         amend both in a synchronised manner. 
                                   Example: If the time spent by the researcher or staff member on the linked MSCA action is changed (e.g. for 
                                   MSCA-IF from full-time to part-time), the duration of the MSCA-SNLS action may also have to be adapted 
                                   accordingly.

            ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT TO A NEW BENEFICIARY 
             ARTICLE 56a — TRANSFER OF THE AGREEMENT TO A NEW BENEFICIARY  
             56a.1 Conditions  
             If the linked grant (see Article 1) is transferred to a new beneficiary, the beneficiary may also request the 
             transfer of this action.  
             56a.2 Procedure  
             The beneficiary must formally notify a request for amendment to the Agency (see Article 55). 
             The request must include:  
                 -   the reasons why;  
                 -   the date the change takes effect;  
                 -   the opinion of the researcher or staff member;  
                 -   a proposal for the necessary changes, including the Accession Form for the new beneficiary (see 
                     Annex 3).  
             The change will take effect on the day set out in the amendment.  
             56a.3 Effects 
             If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement will be amended to introduce the 
             necessary changes (see Article 55).  
             In this case, the former beneficiary must:  
                 -   transfer immediately the remaining contribution to the new beneficiary and  
                 -   submit — within 30 days from the change — a ‘transfer report’, containing an overview of the 
                     progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20).  
             The lump sum will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary, on the basis of the part 
             performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining part to be given by the new beneficiary. If the pre-
             financing  received  by  the  former  beneficiary  (see  Article  21)  exceeds  the  amount  of  the  lump  sum 
             recalculated for the former beneficiary, the Agency will request the former beneficiary to transfer to the new 
             beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received in excess.  
             Where necessary, the former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements concerning the transfer of 
             any equipment, materials and/or services purchased and used for the researcher or staff member concerned. 
             The former beneficiary may object only on the basis that the transfer is technically not possible or not 
             possible under national law.  
             If  the  Agency  considers that  the  reasons  provided  do  not  justify  the  transfer,  it  will  reject  the  request 
             specifying the grounds for the rejection.

            1. Transfer of the GA  
            MSCA-SNLS grant can be transferred to a new beneficiary if the main grant (MSCA-IF, MSCA-
            ITN, MSCA-RISE or MSCA-COFUND)  is transferred to it. 
            Transfer of the main grant agreement may cover: 
                -   'transfer' in the sense of Article 56a MSCA-IF MGA 
                -   change of beneficiary due to 'partial takeover' 
                -   addition  of  a  new  beneficiary  to  the  main  grant,  which  will  host  the  researcher/staff 
                    member with special needs.  
             
                       Transfer — The rights and obligations under the GA are transferred from the beneficiary to a new 
                   beneficiary — without passing via termination (Article 50) or addition of a new beneficiary (Article 56).  
                   NO  transfer  before  the  amendment  has  been  accepted  by  the  Agency.  Transfers  without  a  formal 
                   amendment are void and may result in GA termination. The former beneficiary remains fully responsible 
                   until the Agency has approved the amendment. 
             
                    
            The transfer may NOT entail changes to the GA which would call into question the decision to 
                    
            award the MSCA-SNLS grant.  
                    
                Example: The transfer will not be accepted if the special needs item or service is eligible for funding by another 
                source in the country of the new beneficiary (e.g. social security or health insurance system). 
                    
                    
                    
            2. Procedure  
                    
            The former beneficiary must submit a request for amendment to the Agency.  
                For the amendment, the rules of the General MGA apply (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA).  
                The transfer date will be added to the Preamble of the GA.  
                    The date must be selected in the amendment request. The transfer date must be the same 
                    date as the accession date of the new beneficiary. Retroactive dates are allowed, but only 
                    in exceptional cases and with a specific justification (see Article 55 H2020 General MGA).  
                The amendment request must include the Accession Form (i.e. the statement to take over all 
                rights and obligations under the GA) of the new beneficiary (signed directly in the Funding & 
                Tenders Portal).  
                  For more guidance on amendments, see the Guide on amendment types & supporting documents and the 
               Funding & Tenders Portal Online Manual.   
                
            3. Effects  
            The former beneficiary must submit — within 30 days from the transfer date — a transfer report, 
            with information on:  
                   the progress of the work and  
                   the financial statement (for the open period until transfer).

            This report is for information purposes only. The Agency will use it to decide on how to split the 
            lump sum and instruct the former beneficiary to transfer the remaining pre-financing to the 
            new beneficiary.  
            The financial statement for the open reporting period until transfer must be also uploaded with the 
            final report (by the new beneficiary, together with its own financial statement). 
            The lump sum will be split between the former beneficiary and the new beneficiary — on the basis 
            of the part performed by the former beneficiary and the remaining part to be given to the new 
            beneficiary. If the pre-financing received by the former beneficiary (see Article 21) exceeds the 
            amount of the lump sum recalculated for the former beneficiary, the Agency will request the 
            former beneficiary to transfer to the new beneficiary any part of the pre-financing received in 
            excess.  
            The former and the new beneficiary must agree on arrangements, where necessary, concerning 
            the  transfer  of  the  equipment,  materials  and/or  services  purchased  for  the  researcher/staff 
            member.

                         The SME Instrument MGAs follow the General MGA for numbering and content, except for:

                                  By contrast, provisions that do not deviate from the General MGA, but that require clarification 
                                  or a specific explanation or interpretation for SME Instrument actions are added:

                         What? SME Instrument Ph1 Lump Sum funds: 
                                         the feasibility study for an innovation idea (i.e. a ‘proof of concept’ or ‘business plan’ for 
                                          new, altered or improved product, process or service). 
                         The feasibility study of Phase 1 should cover all topics that are necessary to assess quality and 
                         potential of the innovation idea (e.g. risk assessment, market study, user involvement, intellectual 
                         property  management,  innovation  strategy  development,  partner  search,  feasibility  of  concept 
                         etc.). 
                                  The innovation idea must have commercial potential and considerable novelty for its sector 
                                  (i.e. for technological innovation ideas: ‘technology readiness level’ of 6 or above; see General 
                                  Annex G to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                         The  implementation  in  Phase  2  must  then  focus  on  innovation  activities  (e.g.  demonstration, 
                         testing, prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication) but may also 
                         include some research.  
                                  If provided for in the work programme/call, an SME Instrument Ph2 action may exceptionally 
                                  concern pre-dominantly research activities. In this case, it will be funded with a GA based on 
                                  the General MGA (instead of the SME Instrument Ph2 MGA). 
                         SME actions are normally mono-beneficiary actions, but can also be multi-beneficiary. 
                         SME actions are funded under Part II of Horizon 2020, ‘Innovation in SMEs’ (e.g. H2020-SMEINST-
                         01-2016-2017).

                         Since these grants consist in a single lump sum, there is only one budget category. 
                                  Budget category of the SME Ph1 Lump Sum MGA: 
                                                  costs for the feasibility study (direct and indirect costs) 
                          
                                    The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                           5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).

                           5.2                Form of grant, reimbursement rate and form of costs 
                           The grant reimburses 70 % of the action’s eligible costs (see Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs 
                            grant’) (see Annex 2). 
                          
                            The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR 71 429 (seventy one thousand four hundred and twenty 
                           nine).   
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) for the costs for the feasibility study must be declared as the lump sum set out 
                           in Annex 2 (i.e. under the form of ‘lump sum costs’).

                                  The lump sum has been set at EUR 71 429, to give a round amount of EUR 50 000 when the 
                                  reimbursement rate of 70 % is applied. It is one amount (for the entire consortium).  
                         The  eligibility  conditions  are  set  out  in  Article  6.  If  the  action  is  correctly  implemented,  the 
                         beneficiaries are entitled to receive this fixed amount of EU funding (lump sum). 
                                                 The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs that are incurred for the feasibility

                           5.3                Final grant amount — Calculation 
                           The  final  grant  amount  depends  on  the  proper  implementation  of  the  action  in  accordance  with  the 
                           Agreement’s terms and conditions. 
                           This amount is calculated by the Agency — when the payment of the balance is made (see Article 21) — in 
                            the following steps: 
                                     Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate 
                                     Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                           5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs 
                           The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (lump sum costs; see Article 6) 
                           declared by the beneficiary and approved by the Agency (see Article 21). 
                           5.3.2  Step  2  —  Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                           obligations— Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation 
                           If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the Agency will calculate the reduced maximum grant amount by 
                            deducting  the  amount  of  the  reduction  (calculated  in  proportion  to  the  seriousness  of  the  errors, 
                           irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum grant 
                            amount set out in Article 5.1. 
                           In this case, the final grant amount will be the lower of the following two: 
                                     -        the amount obtained in Step 1 or 
                                     -        the amount obtained in Step 2. 
                            
                            
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For SME Ph1 grants, the rules on the calculation of the final grant amount are in principle the 
                         same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared is pre-filled by the system), 
                         there is NO need to calculate the: 
                                                  limit to the maximum grant amount or  
                                                  reduction due to the no-profit rule.

                           5.4                Revised final grant amount — Calculation 
                           If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
                           Article 22) — the Agency rejects costs (see Article 42) or reduces the grant (see Article 43), it will calculate 
                             the ‘revised final grant amount’.  
                          
                             This amount is calculated by the Agency on the basis of the findings, as follows:  
                          
                                     -        in  case  of  rejection  of  costs:  by  applying  the  reimbursement rate  to the  revised eligible costs 
                                              approved by the Agency; 
                                     -        in case of reduction of the grant: in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
                                              fraud or  breach of obligations (see Article 43.2).  
                           In case of rejection of costs and reduction of the grant, the revised final grant amount will be the lower of 
                             the two amounts above.  
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Revised final grant amount 
                         For SME Ph1 grants, the rules on the calculation of the revised final grant amount are in principle 
                         the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However,  for  SME  Ph1  Lump  Sum  grants,  improper  implementation  of  the  action  leads  to 
                         ineligibility of the costs (NOT to grant reduction). Therefore, the grant reduction mentioned in this 
                         provision does not relate to improper implementation of the action (but only to other breaches and 
                         substantial errors, irregularities and fraud; see Article 43).

                         2.2  These  costs  must  be  declared  as  the  amount  fixed  by  Decision  C(2013)  8198                                                                                                                                     and

                                             Since  SME Ph1 grants have a reimbursement rate of 70%, the lump sum that the beneficiaries 
                                      receive is EUR 50 000.  
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                         In  practice,  the  declaration  of  costs  for  SME  Ph1  grants  is  completely  automatized.  The

                         2.4 NO calculation is necessary (since it is a fixed global amount). 
                                       
                         By signing the financial statement (for multi-beneficiary actions: one common financial statement

                           ‘Ineligible costs’ are: 
                                       (a) costs that do not comply with the conditions set out above (see Article 6.1) and

                                                and financed by the EU or Euratom budget and grants awarded by bodies other than the Agency

                           Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

                           ARTICLE 7 — GENERAL OBLIGATION TO PROPERLY IMPLEMENT THE ACTION 
                           7.1                 General obligation to properly implement the action 
                           The beneficiary must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions 
                           of the Agreement and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national law. 
                           7.2                 Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If the beneficiary does not properly implement the action (or part of it), the corresponding costs will be 
                             ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           If the beneficiary breaches any other obligation, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                          
                             This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6 
                          
                              
                          
                                            
                         1. Consequences of improper implementation 
                         For SME Ph1 Lump Sum grants, ‘improper implementation of the action not in accordance with 
                         Annex 1’ does NOT lead to grant reduction, but to the ineligibility of the costs (see Article 6.1). 
                                   
                                              If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, costs will be rejected proportionally to the 
                                        tasks or parts of the action not implemented (see Article 42).  
                                                 If the feasibility study is incomplete and thus does not meet the intended objective or is of insufficient 
                                                 quality (e.g. does not permit to assess the quality and potential of the innovation idea), ALL costs will 
                                                 be declared ineligible and there will be NO EU financial contribution 
                                         
                                         
                     By contrast, in case of other serious breaches the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).

                           The beneficiary must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may:  
                                      -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10) and  
                                      -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13). 
                           In these cases, the beneficiary retains sole responsibility towards the Agency for implementing the action.

                         The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable to the SME Ph1 
                         Lump Sum MGA. 
                         The special rules from the General MGA on third party involvement are limited in SME Ph1 actions 
                         to purchases (Article 10) and subcontracting (Article 13). 
                                   
                                               The costs of purchases and subcontracts are ALL covered by the lump sum. NO other costs will be

                         partners (Article 14a) are NOT allowed (since it is a very simple action and moreover targeted at 
                         SMEs,  the Agency expects the beneficiaries to implement the main part of the work — without

                           The beneficiary must make such purchases ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest 
                           price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).  
                           The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
                            the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards its

                           43).

                         The rules on contracts for the purchase of goods, works or services for SME Ph1 actions are in 
                         principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 10 H2020 General MGA). 
                         Since SMEs are, by definition, not ‘contracting authorities’, there is however NO obligation as 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    115
                         regards  compliance  with  the  EU  public  procurement  Directives  2014/24/EU,  2014/25/EU                                                                                                                                       or 
                         2009/81/EC and the national legislation implementing them. 
                         Moreover,  the  obligations  in  Article  10.1  are  NOT  considered  to  be  additional  cost  eligibility 
                         conditions,  but  ‘other  obligations’.  In  case  of  breach,  the  Commission/Agency  may  therefore 
                         reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).

                         ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                           ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                           13.1               Rules for subcontracting action tasks 
                           If necessary to implement the action, the beneficiary may award subcontracts covering the implementation 
                           of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
                           The beneficiary must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
                             lowest price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35). 
                          
                             The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
                           the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards its 
                           subcontractors. 
                           The  beneficiary  must  ensure  that  its  obligations  under  Articles  35,  36,  38  and  46  also  apply  to  the 
                             subcontractors. 
                           13.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
                           43). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                              
                          
                              
                                            
                         1. Subcontracting 
                         The rules on subcontracting for SME Ph1 actions are in principle the same as for the General MGA 
                         (see Articles 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The SME Ph1 MGA has however the following specificities: 
                         Subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action.  
                         Moreover, the estimated subcontracting costs do NOT have to be included in Annex 1 or shown in 
                         the table of estimated costs of Annex 2 (since they are covered by the lump sum). 
                         Since SMEs are not contracting authorities, there is also NO obligation as regards compliance with 
                                                                                                                                                                               116

                           ARTICLE 18 — KEEPING RECORDS — SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION 
                           18.1 Obligation to keep records and other supporting documentation to support the costs declared 
                           The beneficiary must — for a period of three years after the balance is paid — keep adequate records and 
                           other supporting documentation to prove that the corresponding tasks or part of the action as described in 
                            Annex 1 have been implemented properly. The beneficiary does not need to identify the actual eligible 
                           costs covered or provide supporting documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount 
                           declared as the lump sum. 
                           It must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                            investigations (see Article 22). 
                           If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                           Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiary must keep the records and 
                            other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures. 
                           The  beneficiary  must  keep  the  original  documents.  Digital  and  digitalised  documents  are  considered 
                           originals  if  they  are  authorised  by  the  applicable  national  law.  The  Agency  may  accept  non-original 
                            documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance 
                          
                            18.2 Consequences of non-compliance 
                          
                            If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be 
                           ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                            
                                            
                         1. Records and other supporting documentation  
                         For SME Ph1 actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep full records on their actual costs; they only 
                         need to keep the evidence (documentation, records) that the action tasks (as described in Annex 
                         1) were properly carried out. 
                                   Examples: Evidence means documentation that proves that the tasks were carried out. Describing all the tasks 
                                   relating to the feasibility study is usually enough.

                                (a)  a ‘final technical report’ containing a summary with:

                                (b)          a ‘final financial report’ containing a ‘financial statement’ (see Annex 4), which includes the 
                                             request for payment of the balance. 
                                             The financial statement must detail the eligible costs (lump sum costs; see Article 6 and Annex 2). 
                                             Amounts which are not declared in the financial statement will not be taken into account by the

                           The following payments will be made to the beneficiary: 
                                     -        one pre-financing payment; 
                                     -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
                                              20). 
                           21.2               Pre-financing payment — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund 
                           The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiary with a float. 
                           It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
                           The amount of the pre-financing payment will be EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)].  
                           The Agency will — except if Article 48 applies — make the pre-financing payment to the beneficiary 
                           within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see Article 58) or from 10 days before the 
                            starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest. 
                           An amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 5% of the maximum grant 
                           amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Agency from the pre-financing payment and transferred into the 
                            ‘Guarantee Fund’

                                              Guarantee Fund 
                           The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining part of the eligible costs incurred by the beneficiary 
                            for the implementation of the action.  
                            If the total amount of earlier payments is greater than the final grant amount (see Article 5.3), the payment 
                            of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
                            If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency will pay the balance 
                            within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                            Payment is subject  to  the  approval  of  the  final  report.  Its  approval  does  not  imply  recognition  of  the 
                            compliance, authenticity, completeness or correctness of its content. 
                            The amount due as the balance is calculated by the Agency by deducting the total amount of pre-financing 
                            already made, from the final grant amount determined in accordance with Article 5.3: 
                                              {final grant amount (see Article 5.3)

              At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
              and:

                     the amount due as the balance;  
                 -   if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be deducted 
                     from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount: 
                          -   is positive, it will be paid to the beneficiary 
                          -   is negative, it will be recovered.

              amount owed by the beneficiary to the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (under the 
             EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum EU contribution indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated 
              budget (see Annex 2). 
              21.5   Notification of amounts due 
              The Agency will formally notify to the beneficiary the amount due and specify the final grant amount.  
              In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
             contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.

            Payment of the balance 
            How much? The amount of the payment of the balance depends on the overall financial situation

                            in  Annex  1.  If  a  beneficiary  fails  to  implement  its  part  of  the  action,  the  other  beneficiaries  become 
                            responsible for implementing this part (without being entitled to any additional EU funding for doing so),

                         or delay the implementation of the action (see Article 17); 
                     (iv) submit  to the coordinator in good time:  
                          -  the data needed to draw up the technical report (see Article 20);

                             issues (see Article 34); 
                          -  any other documents or information required by the Agency or the Commission under the 
                             Agreement,  unless  the  Agreement  requires  the  beneficiary  to  submit  this  information

               (b)   The coordinator must: 
                     (i)   monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7); 
                     (ii)  act as the intermediary for all communications between the beneficiaries and the Agency (in 
                           particular, providing the Agency with the information described in Article 17), unless the 
                           Agreement specifies otherwise;  
                    (iii)  request and review any documents or information required by the Agency and verify their

                     (v)   ensure that all payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see 
                           Article 21);  
                    (vi)   inform  the  Agency  of  the  amounts  paid  to  each  beneficiary,  when  required  under  the 
                           Agreement (see Articles 44 and 50) or requested by the Agency.  
             
                   The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary 
                   or third party.

            The rules on internal division of roles and responsibilities are similar to the General MGA (see 
            Article 41 H2020 General MGA). 
            Since  for  SME  Ph1  multi-beneficiary  actions  there  is  however  only  one  (common)  financial 
            statement  (see  Article  20),  there  is  NO  obligation  for  the  beneficiaries  to  submit  their  own

                         ARTICLE 42 — REJECTION OF INELIGIBLE COSTS  
                           ARTICLE 42 — REJECTION OF INELIGIBLE COSTS  
                           42.1               Conditions  
                           The Agency will —at the payment of the balance or afterwards — reject any costs which are ineligible 
                           (i.e. if the action as described in Annex 1 is not properly implemented; see Article 6), in particular following 
                            checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 22). 
                           The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant (see Article 
                           22.5.2).  
                           42.2               Ineligible costs to be rejected — Calculation — Procedure 
                           Ineligible costs will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented. 
                           If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery (see Article 44), the Agency  will formally notify the 
                           beneficiary of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the reasons why (if applicable, together with the 
                            notification  of  amounts  due;  see  Article  21.5).  The  beneficiary  may  —  within  30  days  of  receiving 
                           notification — formally notify the Agency of its disagreement and the reasons why. 
                           If the rejection of costs leads to a recovery, the Agency will follow the contradictory procedure with ‘pre-
                            information letter’ set out in Article 44. 
                           42.3               Effects 
                           If the Agency rejects costs at the payment of the balance, it will deduct them from the total eligible costs 
                           declared, for the action, in the financial statement (see Article 20.4). It will then calculate the payment of the 
                            balance as set out in Article 21.4.    
                          
                           If the Agency rejects costs after the payment of the balance, it will deduct the amount rejected from the 
                            total eligible costs declared, in the financial statement. It will then calculate the revised final grant amount 
                           as set out in Article 5.4.  
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Rejection of ineligible costs 
                         The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 42 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since for SME Ph1 Lump Sum grants the main cost eligibility condition refers to ‘proper 
                         implementation  of  the  action  in  accordance  with  Annex  1’  (see  Article  6.1),  improper 
                         implementation leads to the ineligibility of the costs (NOT grant reduction; see also Article 7). If 
                         the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, the costs will be considered ineligible and 
                         rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented.  
                          
                                            Cost rejections will be made for improper implementation of the action (see Article 7). 
                                               
                         If  the  feasibility  study  is  incomplete  and  thus  does  not  meet  the  intended  objective  or  is  of 
                                      
                         insufficient  quality  (e.g.  does  not  permit  to  assess  the  quality  and potential of the innovation 
                                      
                         idea), ALL costs will be declared ineligible and there will be NO EU financial contribution.

                           ARTICLE 43 — REDUCTION OF THE GRANT 
                           43.1               Conditions 
                           The Agency may — at the payment of the balance or afterwards — reduce the maximum grant amount 
                           (see Article 5.1), if:  
                                     (a)  the beneficiary (or natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                              has committed: 
                                                  (i)          substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
                                                (ii)           serious  breach  of  obligations  under  the  Agreement  or  during  the  award  procedure 
                                                               (including submission of false information, failure to provide required information, breach 
                                                               of ethical principles) or 
                                     (b)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) 
                                              has  committed — in other EU or Euratom grants awarded to it under similar conditions  — 
                                              systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                                              material impact on this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 
                                              22.5.2). 
                           Improper implementation of the action as described in Annex 1 will not lead to a reduction of the grant but 
                            to a rejection of costs (see Article 42).  
                           43.2               Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure 
                           The amount of the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                           breach of obligations.  
                           Before  reduction  of  the  grant,  the  Agency  will  formally  notify  a  ‘pre-information  letter’  to  the 
                           beneficiary:  
                                   -        informing it of its intention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons why 
                                            and 
                                   -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                           If the Agency does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the observations it 
                           has  received,  it  will  formally  notify  confirmation  of  the  reduction  (if  applicable,  together  with  the 
                            notification of amounts due; see Article 21). 
                                                 
                            43.3              Effects  
                                                 
                            If the Agency reduces the grant at the time of the payment of the balance, it will calculate the reduced 
                            grant amount for the action and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see Articles 
                                                 
                            5.3.4 and 21.4). 
                         1. Reduction of the grant  
                            If the Agency reduces the grant after the payment of the balance, it will calculate the revised final grant 
                         The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                            amount (see Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount is lower than the final grant amount, the Agency 
                         Article 42 H2020 General MGA). 
                            will recover the difference (see Article 44).  
                         However, since for SME Ph1 Lump Sum grants ‘proper implementation of the action in accordance 
                             
                         with Annex 1’ is an eligibility rule and does NOT lead to the reduction of the grant (see also 
                         Articles 6.1 and 7), the grant can be reduced only in case of other serious breaches of obligations 
                         or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud; see Article 43 H2020 General MGA). 
                                      Grant reductions will be made for substantial errors, irregularities or fraud and serious breaches 
                               of obligation other than proper implementation.

                           44.1               Amount to be recovered — Calculation — Procedure 
                           The Agency will — at the payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any amount that was paid, 
                           but is not due under the Agreement.  
                           44.1.1   Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation

                           If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally 
                           notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the beneficiary:  
                                     -        informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                                     -        specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                                              Guarantee Fund; and 
                                     -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                           If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
                           received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and: 
                                   -          pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                                              Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                          
                                   -          formally  notify  to  the  beneficiary  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                                              recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This note 
                                              will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
                           If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
                            the amount:  
                                     (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                                              beneficiary by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                                              budget). 
                          
                                              In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  Agency  or  the 
                                              Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                                     (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will formally notify the 
                                              beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                          
                                                       (i)  not applicable; 
                                                       (ii)  by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under 
                                                                Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)  and Article 79(2) of the

              Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
              the principal.

              44.1.3   Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
              If, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the beneficiary must 
              repay the difference to the Agency. 
              The Agency will formally notify a pre-information letter to the beneficiary: 
                 -   informing it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and 
                 -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
              received, it will confirm the amount to be recovered and formally notify to the beneficiary a debit note. 
             This note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
              If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission will recover 
              the amount:  
                 (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                     beneficiary by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                     budget). 
                     In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  Agency  or  the 
                     Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
             
                 (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission  will formally notify the 
                     beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                           (i)   not applicable; 
                           (ii)  by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under

                                 the Financial Regulation No 966/2012. 
              If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
              increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the date for 
             payment in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment 
              of the amount. 
              Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
             the principal. 
             
             Bank charges incurred in the recovery process will be borne by the beneficiary, unless Directive 2007/64/EC

              Not applicable 
              44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance 
              If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the Agency will formally notify 
              a ‘pre-information letter’ to the coordinator:  
                 -   informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                 -   specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                     Guarantee Fund and  
                 -   inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If no observations are submitted or the Agency decides to pursue recovery despite the observations it has 
              received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21.5) and: 
                -    pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                     Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                -    formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                     recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This note 
                     will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
              If the coordinator does not repay the Agency by the date in the debit note, the Agency or the Commission 
             will recover the amount:  
                 (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  coordinator’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                     coordinator by the Agency, the Commission or another executive agency (from the EU or Euratom 
                     budget). 
             
                     In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  Agency  may  offset 
                     before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                 (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The Agency or the Commission will formally notify the 
                     coordinator the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                        (i)  not applicable; 
                       (ii)  by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under  
                              Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 79(2) of the

              If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
             increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the payment 
              date in the debit note, up to and including the date the Agency or the Commission receives full payment of 
             the amount. 
             
             Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
              the principal.

              2007/64/EC applies. 
              44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance

             repay the difference to the Agency.

                                 Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 79(2) of the

            1. Recovery of undue amounts 
            The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 44 H2020 General MGA). 
            The SME Ph1 multi-beneficiary MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
            Since the coordinator alone is financially responsible (for the entire grant), the Agency will recover 
            ONLY from it. 
                Best  practice:  Beneficiaries  should  foresee  internal  arrangements  to  redistribute  the  financial 
                responsibility internally in the consortium in a fair way.  
            There is therefore also NO need for a report on the distribution of payments between beneficiaries.

                           The beneficiary may terminate the Agreement. 
                           The beneficiary must formally notify termination to the Agency (see Article 52), stating: 
                                     -        the reasons why and  
                                     -        the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
                           If no reasons are given or if the Agency considers the reasons do not justify termination, the Agreement will 
                           be considered to have been ‘terminated improperly’. 
                           The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification. 
                           50.1.2 Effects 
                           The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
                            Article 20). 
                           If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be reimbursed. 
                           The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on the 
                           basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement.  
                           In case of improper termination, the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43).

                                              likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or calls into question the

                                  including  improper  implementation  of  the  action,  submission  of  false  information, 
                                  failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles); 
                 (m)  the beneficiary (or the natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its 
                     behalf) has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants  awarded to it under similar conditions — 
                     systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                     material impact on this grant (‘extension of findings from other grants to this grant’; see Article 
                     22.5.2); 
                 (n)  not applicable. 
              50.3.2   Procedure       
              Before terminating the Agreement, the Agency will formally notify the beneficiary:  
                  -  informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and 
                  -  inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and — in case of Point 
                     (l.ii)  above — to inform the Agency of the measures to ensure compliance with the obligations 
                     under the Agreement.   
              If the Agency does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the observations it 
              has received, it will formally notify to the beneficiary confirmation of the termination and the date it will 
             take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is not continued.  
              The termination will take effect: 
                 -   for  terminations  under  Points  (b),  (e),  (g),  (h),  and  (l.ii)  above:  on  the  day  specified  in  the 
                     notification of the confirmation (see above); 
                 -   for terminations under Points (d), (f), (k), (l.i) and (m) above: on the day after the notification of the 
                     confirmation is received by the beneficiary. 
             50.3.3    Effects  
             The beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit the final report (see 
             Article 20). 
             If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be reimbursed.

              The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on the 
              basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement.  
              This does not affect the Agency’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative and 
             financial sanctions (Article 45).  
              The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency (see Article 46).

              50.1   Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiaries 
              50.1.1   Conditions and procedure 
              The beneficiaries may terminate the Agreement. 
              The coordinator must formally notify termination to the Agency (see Article 52), stating: 
                 -   the reasons why and  
                 -   the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
              If no reasons are given or if the Agency considers the reasons do not justify termination, the Agreement will 
              be considered to have been ‘terminated improperly’. 
              The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification. 
              50.1.2 Effects 
              The coordinator must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
              Article 20). 
              If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be reimbursed. 
              The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on the 
             basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the Agreement.  
              In case of improper termination, the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43). 
              50.2   Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries 
              50.2.1   Conditions and procedure 
              The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
              beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.  
              The coordinator must formally notify termination to the Agency (see Article 52) and inform the beneficiary 
             concerned. 
             
             If the coordinator’s participation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
              by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries). 
              The notification must include: 
                  -   the reasons why;  
                  -   the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing);  
                  -   the date the termination takes effect. This date must be after the notification, and

                         -   a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Annex 1) 
                              and, if necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination 
                              takes effect after the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be included unless 
                              the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose 
                              a new coordinator. 
                  If this information is not given or if the Agency considers that the reasons do not justify termination, the 
                  participation will be considered to have been terminated improperly. 
                  The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification. 
                  50.2.2   Effects 
                  If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency (because it calls into question the decision awarding 
                  the  grant  or  breaches  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  of  applicants)  the  Agreement  may  be  terminated 
                  according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                  If  the  request  for  amendment  is  accepted  by  the  Agency,  the  Agreement  is  amended  to  introduce  the 
                  necessary changes (see Article 55). 
                  Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43) or termination of the Agreement 
                  (see Article 50). 
                  After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 42, 
                  43 and 44) continue to apply.  
                  50.3   Termination  of  the  Agreement  or  of  the  participation  of  one  or  more  beneficiaries,  by  the 
                           Agency  
                  50.3.1   Conditions 
                  The Agency may terminate the Agreement or the participation of one or more beneficiaries, if: 
                        (a)  one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 56); 
                        (b)  a change to their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or those of its 
                             linked third parties)] is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or 
                             calls into question the decision to award the grant; 
                        (c)  following  termination  of  participation  for  one  or  more  beneficiaries  (see  above),  the  necessary 
                             changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the 
                             principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 55);  
                        (d)  implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
                             coordinator (see Article 49.1) and either: 
                 
                                  (i)    resumption is impossible, or 
                 
                                 (ii)     the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the 
                                          grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; 
                        (e)  a beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, 
                             has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
                             any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law; 
                        (f)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf)  has 
                             been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means;

                    Before terminating the Agreement or participation of one or more beneficiaries, the Agency will formally 
                    notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
                          -    informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and 
                          -    inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and — in case of Point 
                               (l.ii) above — to inform the Agency  of the measures to ensure compliance with the obligations 
                               under the Agreement.   
                    If the Agency does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the observations it 
                    has  received,  it  will  formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  or  beneficiary  concerned  confirmation  of  the 
                    termination and the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is not 
                    continued.  
                    The termination will take effect: 
                         -     for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), and (l.ii) above: on the day specified in the 
                               notification of the confirmation (see above);

                      The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on 
                      the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the 
                      Agreement.  
                      This does not affect the Agency’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose administrative 
                      sanctions (Article 53).  
                      The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the Agency   (see Article 46). 
                      After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
                      4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
                (c)    for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries: 
                      The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a request for 
                      amendment  (see  Article  55),  with  a  proposal  for  reallocation  of  the  tasks  (see  Annex  1)  and,  if 
                      necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified after 
                      the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be submitted unless the beneficiary 
                      concerned is the coordinator. In this case the request for amendment must propose a new coordinator. 
                        
                      If the request for amendment is rejected by the Agency (because it calls into question the decision 
                      awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may be 
                      terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                      If the request for amendment is accepted by the Agency, the Agreement is amended to introduce the 
                      necessary changes (see Article 56). 
               
                      After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, 36, 38, 40, 
                      42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
                 
               
                         
              1. GA termination (consortium) 
              The rules on GA termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 50 H2020 
              General MGA). 
              However, for SME Ph1 actions, improper termination by the beneficiaries will lead to a 100% 
              reduction of the grant.  
               
              2. Beneficiary termination (consortium) 
              The rules on beneficiary termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
              50 H2020 General MGA). 
              However, the SME Ph1 multi-beneficiary MGA has the following specificities: 
              The notification must include a reallocation of the tasks (Annex 1), but NO reallocation of the 
              estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned.  
              Moreover, if the GA continues (i.e. it is amended), the termination of the beneficiary will NOT have 
              any effect on the estimated budget (since there is a lump sum for the entire action, i.e. the 
              consortium together).

            3. GA or beneficiary termination (EU)  
            The rules on GA and beneficiary termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 50 H2020 General MGA). 
            However, the SME Ph1 multi-beneficiary MGA has the following specificities: 
            The request for amendment (which the coordinator must send 60 days after termination) must 
            include a reallocation of the tasks (Annex 1), but NO reallocation of the estimated budget of the 
            beneficiary concerned.  
            If the GA continues (i.e. it is amended), the termination of the beneficiary will NOT have any effect 
            on the estimated budget (since there is a lump sum for the entire action, i.e. the consortium as a 
            whole).

                         What? SME Ph2 funds: 
                                         the implementation of an innovation idea (including, prototyping, testing, demonstrating, 
                                          piloting,  large-scale  product  validation  and  market  replication)  —  based  on  a  strategic 
                                          business plan either developed through Phase 1 or another means. 
                         The implementation of Phase 2 must focus on innovation activities (e.g. demonstration, testing, 
                         prototyping, piloting, scaling-up, miniaturisation, design, market replication) but may also include 
                         some research. 
                                 A project may be funded in Phase 2 even if it was not funded in Phase 1. 
                                 The innovation idea must have commercial potential and considerable novelty for its sector (i.e. 
                                 for  technological  innovation  ideas:  ‘technology  readiness  level’  of  6  or  above;  see  General 
                                 Annex G to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                         SME actions are normally mono-beneficiary actions, but can also be multi-beneficiary. 
                         SME actions are funded under Part II of Horizon 2020, ‘Innovation in SMEs’ (e.g. H2020-SMEINST-
                         05-2016-2017).

                         The SME Ph2 MGA uses the same budget categories as the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the SME Ph2 MGA: 
                                                  direct personnel costs 
                                                                    costs for employees (or equivalent) 
                                                                    costs for natural persons working under a direct contract 
                                                                    costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment 
                                                                    costs for SME owners without salary 
                                                                    costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary 
                                                  direct costs of subcontracting 
                                                  other direct costs 
                                                                    travel costs and related subsistence allowances

                                                                    capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure 
                                                  indirect costs 
                                                  specific cost categories (if option applies).

                         1. Reimbursement rate 
                         How much? For SME Ph2 actions, the reimbursement rate is normally set at 70 % (see General 
                         Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                                  If provided for in the work programme/call, an SME Ph2 action may exceptionally be funded at 
                                  100%, with a GA based on the General MGA (instead of the SME Ph2 MGA).

                                     B.  direct costs of subcontracting;  
                                     C.  not applicable; 
                                     D.  other direct costs; 
                                     E.  indirect costs; 
                                     F.  not applicable. 
                           ‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
                            to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point E below). 
                           ‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
                           attributed directly to it. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs — Ineligible costs 
                         The SME Ph2 MGA uses the same budget categories (covering the same types of costs) as the 
                         General MGA and the same eligibility conditions and calculation rules apply (see Article 6 
                         H2020 General MGA). 
                         However,  since  SMEs  are  by  definition  NO  non-profit  legal  entities,  they  can  NOT  declare 
                         additional remuneration (under budget category A ‘personnel costs’; see Article 6.2.A.1 H2020 
                         General MGA).

                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                     -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);  
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11); 
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12);  
                                     -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13); 
                                     -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14). 
                           In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the Agency and the other beneficiaries for 
                           implementing the action.

                           13.1.1  If  necessary  to  implement  the  action,  the  beneficiary  may  award  subcontracts  covering  the 
                           implementation of certain action tasks described in Annex 1. 
                           The beneficiary must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the lowest 
                            price. In doing so, it must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35).

                            [OPTION for actions involving PCP or PPI: In addition, for the pre-commercial procurement (PCP) or 
                           procurement of innovative solutions (PPI), the beneficiary must follow a transparent and non-discriminatory 
                            procedure, including at least the following: 
                                     (a)  an ‘open market consultation’ published in the Official Journal of the European Union via a ‘prior 
                                              information notice (PIN)’ and promoted and advertised widely; 
                                     (b)  a ‘contract notice’ allowing for a time-limit for receipt of tenders of at least 2 months, published in 
                                              the Official Journal of the European Union and promoted and advertised widely; 
                                     (c)  a  ‘request for tenders’ based on functional or performance-based specifications (that take into 
                                              account the outcome of the open market consultation) and describing the practical set-up for the 
                                              implementation of the subcontract(s); 
                          
                                     (d)  an objective and non-discriminatory evaluation of the tenders and award of subcontract(s); 
                          
                                     (e)  a ‘contract award notice’ published in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
                           The beneficiary must also ensure that every prior information notice, contract notice or contract award 
                            notice published in relation to the subcontracting includes the following disclaimer: 
                                     "This  procurement  receives  funding  under  the  European  Union’s  Horizon  2020  research  and 
                                     innovation  programme  under  the  grant  agreement  No  [number]).  The  EU  is  however  not 
                                     participating as a contracting authority in this procurement." ] 
                           [OPTION 1 only for actions involving PPI: Participation in PPI tendering procedures must be open on 
                           equal terms to tenderers from EU Member States, associated countries12 and other countries with which the 
                            EU has an agreement in the field of public procurement. If the WTO Government Procurement Agreement 
                           applies, PPI subcontracts must also be open to tenderers from States that have ratified this agreement. 
                           If the procurement of the innovative solution (PPI) consists (and is limited to) buying a set of prototypes 
                           and/or test products that were developed during a preceding PCP action, the beneficiary does not need to 
                            make an open market consultation, contract notice and contract award notice under Points (a), (b) and (e) 
                           above. In this case, it must make a request for tenders from at least three providers (including the providers 
                            that participated in the preceding PCP), in accordance with the negotiated procedure without publication 
                           under Directives 2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU)24.] 
                           [OPTION 2 only for actions involving PCP: Subcontracts for pre-commercial procurement must provide 
                            for the following: 
                                     -        the ownership, by the subcontractors, of the intellectual property rights on the results that they 
                                              generate; 
                                     -        the right of the buyer to access results as well as the background necessary to use the results — on 
                                              a royalty-free basis — for its own use;

                           -      the right of the buyer to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to 
                                  third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable conditions —   (without the right to 
                                  sub-licence); 
                           -      the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer to the buyer the ownership of intellectual property 
                                  generated by subcontractors during the PCP, if subcontractors fail to commercially exploit the 
                                  results within the period set out in the subcontract; 
                           -      the right of the buyer to publish — at the time of the contract award notice — the identity of the 
                                  winning tenderers and a project summary provided by the winning tenderers, and to publish — 
                                  after R&D has finished and after consulting the subcontractors — summaries of the results as well 
                                  as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed the last phase of the PCP. 
                    The  beneficiary  must  ensure  that  the  majority  of  the  research  and  development  work  done  by  the 
                    subcontractor(s) (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
                     associated countries (‘place of performance obligation’).] 
                    The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the 
                    total estimated costs of subcontracting must be set out in Annex 2. The Agency may however approve 
                     subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 and 2 without amendment according to Article 55, if: 
                           -      they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report, and 
                           -     they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
                                 the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                    [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information   may be subcontracted 
                    only after explicit approval (in writing) from the Agency (see Article 37).] 
                    The beneficiary must ensure that the Agency, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and 
                     the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22 and 23 also towards its 
                    subcontractors. 
                    13.1.2 The beneficiary must ensure that its obligations under Articles 35, 36 38 and 46 also apply to the 
                     subcontractors. 
                    13.2          Consequences of non-compliance 
                    If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1, the costs related to the subcontract 
                    concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                    If the beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 
                     43). 
                   
                    Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                     
                    11    If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality, taking into account 
                          the value of the contracts and the relative size of the EU contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Specific rules 
                          must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable provisions 
                          should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000. The authorising officer 
                                                                                                                   
                          may set a threshold higher than EUR 60 000 on the basis of a risk assessment.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                    SME Ph2 MGA 
            1. Subcontracting 
            The rules on subcontracting for SME Ph2 actions are similar to those of the General MGA (see 
            Articles 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA). 
            The SME Ph2 MGA has however the following specificities: 
            Subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action. 
            Moreover, the Agency will assess compliance with best value for money during the evaluation of 
            the proposal (and therefore be able to give higher security on subcontracts that are part of the 
            proposal). 
                Assurance can only be given on subcontracts that are described in sufficient detail in the 
                proposal.  
                    For already awarded subcontracts: action task(s) that are subcontracted; key information 
                    on the award procedure; name of subcontractor, price and object; explanation why the 
                    subcontractor and the price are appropriate. 
                    For future subcontracts: action task(s) to be subcontracted; estimated budget; procedure 
                    that will be followed to ensure best value for money. 
                    Annex 1 will explicitly identify the subcontracts for which assurance is given by the Agency. 
                    (For these subcontracts, beneficiaries have assurance that compliance with best value for 
                    money will not be challenged in audits — unless it turns out that the beneficiary did not 
                    follow the procedure described or concealed information for the purpose of the approval). 
                Change to a subcontract — Subcontracts which were assessed during proposal evaluation 
                (and for which assurance was granted) may be changed (via an amendment).  
                        Best practice: Beneficiaries should contact the Agency (via the Funding & Tenders Portal 
                        messaging function), if they intend to amend the grant to change a subcontract assessed 
                        during proposal evaluation.  
                    The amendment request will not be agreed, if it would result in changes that — if known 
                    before awarding the grant — would have had an impact on the award decision (see Article 
                    55). 
                            Example (acceptable): the subcontractor went bankrupt  
                            Examples (not acceptable): the action tasks subcontracted changed; increase of price of already 
                            awarded subcontracts. 
                    The Agency will examine the change to evaluate its impact on best value for money — and 
                    will either: 
                           grant assurance, on the basis of the justifications provided (similar to those used at 
                            the proposal stage)  
                        OR  
                           refuse it (if it considers that the subcontract is not best value for money or if it 
                            cannot be assessed due to a lack of information). 
                     
                               Changes to a subcontract may only be done if the assurance on best value for money is 
                           granted by the Agency.  
                            
                            
                New subcontracts — New subcontracts (i.e. not already part of the proposal/Annex1), will be 
                assessed by the Agency for best value for money during the amendment procedure.

                     If subcontracts are added not via a formal amendment but via the simplified approval procedure: 
                  there is NO assessment (and the beneficiary therefore bears the full risk). 
                                                                                                                   
                   
            Finally,  for  SME  Ph2  actions,  subcontracts  must  provide  for  the  right  of  the  beneficiaries  to 
            commercially  exploit  the  results  generated  by  subcontractors  during  the  subcontract

            Article 26.3).

                           The beneficiary must submit to the Agency (see Article 52) the technical and financial reports set out in this 
                           Article.  
                           These reports  include  the  requests  for  payment  and  must  be  drawn  up  using  the  forms  and  templates 
                             provided in the electronic exchange system (see Article 52).

                             The action is divided into the following ‘reporting periods’: 
                          
                                      -        RP1: from month 1 to month [X] 
                                      -        [- RP2: from month [X+1] to month [Y] 
                                      -        RP3: from month [Y+1] to month [Z] 
                                      -        [same for other RPs] 
                                      -        RPN: from month [N+1]to [the last month of the project].]

                         1. Reporting periods 
                         The reporting periods for SME Ph2 actions are normally the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 20.2 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The reporting periods may however be shorter and more frequent than in other H2020 actions.

                           […] 
                           26.3 Rights of third parties (including personnel)  
                           If  third  parties  (including personnel) may claim rights to the results, the beneficiary must ensure that it 
                           complies with its obligations under the Agreement. 
                           If a third party generates results for a beneficiary, the beneficiary must  obtain all necessary rights (transfer, 
                             licences or other) from the third party, in order to be able to respect its obligations as if those results were 
                           generated by the beneficiary itself and ensure its possibility to commercially exploit the results (‘freedom to 
                           operate’).  
                           For this purpose, it must: 
                                      -       in  agreements  with  employees  or  third  parties  involved  in  the  action  (such  as,  for  instance, 
                                              subcontractors):  retain  the  right  to  commercially  exploit  the  results  (at  least  for  the  forms  of 
                                              exploitation set out in the ‘commercialisation plan’; see Annex 1), if necessary by agreeing to a 
                                              licence and 
                                      -       in all other cases: take measures to obtain, from the third parties, licences for the exploitation. 
                           If obtaining the rights is impossible, the beneficiary must refrain from using third parties to generate the 
                           results. 
                           […] 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Third parties with rights on results — Freedom to operate 
                         ‘Freedom to operate’ means being able to fully commercially exploit the action’s results. 
                         The beneficiaries must safeguard their freedom to operate in all agreements with employees and 
                         third parties involved in the action (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA). 
                                   Example: in  their  agreements  with  subcontractors,  beneficiaries  must  ensure  their  right  to  commercially 
                                   exploit the results of work subcontracted, even if this involves using the subcontractor’s IPR background. 
                         In addition, they may have to obtain licenses to commercially exploit the results from other third 
                         parties (i.e. third parties that are not participating in the action implementation). 
                                   Example:  if  a  third  party  that  is  not  involved  in  the  action  owns  IPRs  that  may  stand  in  the  way  of 
                                   commercially exploiting the results, the beneficiary must obtain the license for commercial exploitation.

             1. Participants: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Linked third parties — Third parties 
                 involved in the action 
             ERA-NET Cofund uses in principle the same concepts for participants as the General MGA (i.e. 
             coordinator, beneficiaries, linked third parties, etc). 
             However,  all  entities  participating  financially  to  the  co-funded  joint  call  for  proposals  MUST 
             participate as beneficiaries or linked third parties in the GA (NOT as other third parties involved in 
             the action; see Article 8). 
                          Linked  third  parties  —  Linked  third  parties  are  allowed  to  fully  participate  in  the  action,  like 
                     beneficiaries.  They  will  therefore  be  treated  for  many  issues  (including  cost  eligibility;  see  Article  6.3 
                     H2020 General MGA ) like beneficiaries. 
                      
                      
             New beneficiaries may be added to ERA-NET Cofund actions during grant preparation or later on 
                      
             with an amendment to the grant agreement, however: 
                     new partners contributing to the co-funded joint call should not join later than the launch 
                      of the call; all partners participating in the call have to be members in the consortium or 
                      linked third parties  
                     beneficiaries joining after the launch of the call can ONLY execute the payments of the 
                      financial support to the third parties (except in case of transfer of rights and obligations; 
                      see Article 55 H2020 General MGA).

                           [OPTION for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation): The action is

                             third country or international organisation action], as described in Annex 1.] 
                          
                                            
                         1. ERA-NET Cofund actions 
                         What? ERA-NET Cofund co-funds: 
                                          a  joint  call  for  proposals  for  trans-national  projects  (and  additional  joint  activities)  by 
                                           regional/national research and innovation programmes (— implemented or funded by the 
                                           beneficiaries).  
                                           ‘Funded by the beneficiaries’ means funded by providing financial support to third parties. 
                                           This is normally the case if the beneficiaries are research funders and cash contributions 
                                           are received from national programmes. In this case, the beneficiaries launch a call for 
                                           proposals,  resulting  in  grants  for  third  parties.  Most  ERA-NET  Cofund  actions  are 
                                           implemented in this way. 
                                           ‘Implemented  by  the  beneficiaries’  means  that  the  beneficiaries  implement  the  trans-
                                           national  projects  themselves.  This  is  normally  the  case  for  governmental  research 
                                           organisations implementing a research programme based on institutional funding (i.e. not 
                                           project-based funding). In this case, the co-funded call for proposals is based on in-kind 
                                           contributions  from  their  institutional  funding  and  the  beneficiaries  then  carry  out  the 
                                           selected trans-national projects themselves, either fully or partially. 
                                           Only one funded call per GA. 
                                  and 
                                          optional: additional activities related to the coordination of national/regional research and 
                                           innovation programmes. 
                                           The additional activities must relate to the coordination of public research and innovation 
                                           programmes and should focus on preparing and implementing joint activities (including 
                                           other  joint  calls  without  EU  co-funding;  see  General  Annex  D  to  the  H2020  Work 
                                           Programme). 
                                                   These activities must be in addition to implementing a joint call.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019             ERA-NET Cofund MGA 
                        If the additional activities consist in additional calls without top-up funding from the 
                        EU, the requirements set out in Article 15 do NOT apply. 
            Normally, ERA-NET Cofund grants are multi-beneficiary grants; exceptionally they can be mono-
            beneficiary grants for sole participants (see General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
            ERA-NET Cofund actions are funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020 (e.g. FETPROACT-02-2017; SC5-
            33-2017).

                           ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE ACTION 
                           The duration of the action will be 60 months as of [OPTION 1 by default: the first day of the month 
                             following the date the Agreement enters into force (see Article 58)] [OPTION 2 if needed for the action: 
                                                         7
                           [insert date]]  (‘starting date of the action’). 
                            
                             7
                                     This date must be the first day of a month and it must be later than the date of entry into force of the agreement, unless authorised 
                                     otherwise by the authorising officer, if the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the action before the entry into force of the grant 
                                     agreement, or the need to start the action on another day than the first day of the month. In any case, the starting date should not be 
                                     earlier than the date of the submission of the grant application (Article 130 FR). 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Action duration  
                         For ERA-NET Cofund actions, the action duration is usually 60 months. (This relatively long time 
                         is needed because these actions include call preparation, launch of the call, proposal submission 
                         and evaluation, the selection decision, and implementation of the selected transnational projects 
                         — which typically takes 36 months.) 
                                  If implementation of the action is justifiably delayed, the consortium may request an extension 
                                  (i.e.  request  an  amendment  extending  the  action  duration;  see  Article  55  H2020  General 
                                  MGA). Normally, the duration can NOT however exceed 72 months.

             At the end of reporting period 1, the beneficiaries must however make an amendment to adjust 
             the initial budget (i.e. Annex 2, estimated eligible and, if needed, maximum grant amount) down 
             to the amount justified by the selection list and the commitments to fund.  
                  Best practice: If the amendment concerns a very limited share of the budget, beneficiaries are

             How much? For ERA-NET Cofund, the reimbursement rate is currently set at 33 % (see General 
             Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
              
             3. Cost forms 
             The ERA-NET Cofund MGA, uses the same cost forms as the General MGA (i.e. actual costs, unit 
             costs and flat rate costs; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA). 
                  Cost forms of the ERA-NET Cofund MGA: 
                          actual costs for: 
                               costs of providing financial support

                                unit cost, see below)  
                          unit costs for:  
                               personnel  costs  calculated  by  the  beneficiaries  in  accordance  with  their  usual  cost 
                                accounting practices (average personnel costs) 
                               costs of internally invoiced goods and services calculated by the beneficiaries in 
                                accordance with their usual cost accounting practices

                           6.2 Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                           Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following budget categories: 
                                      A.  direct costs related to trans-national projects; 
                                      B.  direct coordination costs for additional activities; 
                                      C.  indirect costs. 
                          
                             ‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
                           to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point C below). 
                           ‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
                             attributed directly to it. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The ERA-NET Cofund MGA has its own budget categories. Some of them cover however the 
                         same types of costs as the General MGA, with the same eligibility conditions and calculation 
                         rules (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA). 
                         For  ease  of  reference,  the  annotations  for  Article  6.2  will  summarise  —  for  each  budget 
                         category — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                  1.  types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                  2.  cost form under which the costs must be declared (i.e. actual costs, unit costs, flat rate)  
                                  3.  eligibility conditions 
                                  4.  how the costs must be calculated.

                           A. Direct costs related to trans-national projects   
                           A.1 Direct costs of providing financial support to third parties implementing trans-national projects 
                             are eligible if the conditions set out in Article 15.1.1 are met. 
                           A.2 Direct costs for the implementation of trans-national projects by the beneficiaries are eligible, if 
                           they comply with the conditions set out in Article 15.1.1 and the following: 
                           A.2.1 Direct personnel costs for the implementation of trans-national projects by the beneficiaries 
                           Types of eligible personnel costs 
                           A.2.1.1 Personnel costs are eligible, if they are related to personnel working for the beneficiary under an 
                             employment contract (or equivalent appointing act) and assigned to the implementation of trans-national 
                           projects  (‘costs  for  employees  (or  equivalent)’).  They  must  be  limited  to  salaries  (including  during 
                             parental leave), social security contributions, taxes and other costs included in the remuneration, if they 
                           arise from national law or the employment contract (or equivalent appointing act). 
                                                                                                                                       8
                             Beneficiaries  that  are  non-profit  legal  entities   may  also  declare  as  personnel  costs  additional 
                           remuneration for personnel assigned to the implementation of trans-national projects (including payments 
                             on the basis of supplementary contracts regardless of their nature), if: 
                                      (a)  it  is  part  of  the  beneficiary’s  usual  remuneration  practices  and  is  paid  in  a  consistent  manner 
                                              whenever the same kind of work or expertise is required; 
                                      (b) the criteria used to calculate the supplementary payments are objective and generally applied by the 
                                              beneficiary, regardless of the source of funding used. 
                           'Additional remuneration' means any part of the remuneration which exceeds what the person would be paid 
                           for time worked in projects funded by national schemes. 
                           Additional remuneration for personnel assigned to the implementation of trans-national projects is eligible 
                             up to the following amount: 
                          
                                      (a)  if  the  person  works  full  time  and  exclusively  on  the  implementation  of  trans-national  projects 
                                              during the full year: up to EUR 8 000; 
                                      (b)  if the person works exclusively on the implementation of trans-national projects but not full-time or 
                                              not for the full year: up to the corresponding pro-rata amount of EUR 8 000, or 
                                      (c)  if the person does not work exclusively on the implementation of trans-national projects: up to a 
                                              pro-rata amount calculated as follows: 
                                                         {{EUR 8 000 
                                                         divided by 
                                                         the number of annual productive hours (see below)}, 
                                                         multiplied by 
                                                         the number of hours that the person has worked on the trans-national projects during the year}. 
                           A.2.1.2 The costs for natural persons working under a direct contract with the beneficiary other than an 
                           employment contract are eligible personnel costs, if: 
                                      (a)  the person works under conditions similar to those of an employee (in particular regarding the way 
                                              the work is organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed);  
                                      (b)  the  result  of  the  work  carried  out  belongs  to  the  beneficiary  (unless  exceptionally  agreed 
                                              otherwise), and 
                                      (c)  the costs are not significantly different from those for personnel performing similar tasks under an 
                                              employment contract with the beneficiary. 
                             A.2.1.3 The costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment are eligible personnel costs if

              Calculation 
              Personnel costs must be calculated by the beneficiaries as follows: 
                   {{hourly rate 
                   multiplied by 
                   number of actual hours worked on the implementation of trans-national projects}, 
                   plus     
                   for non-profit legal entities: additional remuneration to personnel assigned to the implementation of trans-national 
                   projects under the conditions set out above (Point A.2.1.1)}. 
              The number of actual hours declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 18). 
              The total number of hours declared in EU or Euratom grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than 
             the annual productive hours used for the calculations of the hourly rate. Therefore, the maximum number of 
              hours that can be declared for the grant are: 
                   {number of annual productive hours for the year (see below) 
                   minus 
                   total number of hours declared by the beneficiary, for that person for that year, for other EU or Euratom grants}. 
              The ‘hourly rate’ is one of the following: 
               (a)  for personnel costs declared as actual costs (i.e. budget categories A.2.1.1,A.2.1.2 and A.2.1.3) : the 
                   hourly rate is calculated per full financial year as follows: 
                     {actual annual personnel costs (excluding additional remuneration) for the person 
                     divided by 
                     number of annual productive hours}. 
             
                     using the personnel costs and the number of productive hours for each full financial year covered 
                     by the reporting period concerned. If a financial year is not closed at the end of the reporting period, 
                     the beneficiaries must use the hourly rate of the last closed financial year available. 
                     For the ‘number of annual productive hours’, the beneficiaries may choose one of the following: 
                          (i)  'fixed number of hours': 1 720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro-
                               rata for persons not working full time); 
                          (ii) 'individual annual productive hours': the total number of hours worked by the person in the 
                               year for the beneficiary, calculated as follows: 
                                    {annual  workable  hours  of  the  person  (according  to  the  employment  contract,  applicable 
                                    collective labour agreement or national law) 
                                    plus 
                                    overtime worked 
                                    minus 
                                    absences (such as sick leave and special leave)}. 
             
                               ‘Annual workable hours’ means the period during which the personnel must be working, 
                               at  the  employer’s  disposal  and  carrying  out  his/her  activity  or  duties  under  the 
                               employment contract, applicable collective labour agreement or national working time 
                               legislation. 
                               If  the  contract  (or  applicable  collective  labour  agreement  or  national  working  time 
                               legislation) does not allow to determine the annual workable hours, this option cannot be 
                               used.

                               If there is no applicable reference for the standard annual workable hours, this option 
                               cannot be used. 
                          For  all  options,  the  actual  time  spent  on  parental  leave  by  a  person  assigned  to  the 
                          implementation  of  trans-national  projects  may  be  deducted  from  the  number  of  annual 
                          productive hours. 
             
                     As an alternative, beneficiaries may calculate the hourly rate per month, as follows: 
                  
                        {{actual monthly personnel cost (excluding additional remuneration) for the person  
                         
                        divided by  
                         
                        {number of annual productive hours / 12}}. 
                      
                        using  the  personnel  costs  for  each  month  and  (one  twelfth  of)  the  annual  productive  hours 
                        calculated according to either option (i) or (iii) above, i.e.: 
                         
                            - fixed number of hours or 
                                 
                            - standard annual productive hours. 
                                 
                        Time spent on parental leave may not be deducted when calculating the hourly rate per month. 
                        However, beneficiaries may declare personnel costs incurred in periods of parental leave in 
                        proportion to the time the person worked on the action in that financial year. 
                         
                        If  parts  of  a  basic  remuneration  are  generated  over  a  period  longer  than  a  month,  the 
                        beneficiaries may include only the share which is generated in the month (irrespectively of the 
                        amount actually paid for that month).  
                  
                    Each beneficiary must use only one option (per full financial year or per month) during each full 
                    financial year;  
              
                (b)  for personnel costs declared on the basis of unit costs (i.e. budget categories A.2.1.1 and A.2.1.2) 
                    calculated in accordance with the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices: the hourly rate 
                    calculated by the beneficiary in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices, if: 
                     -   the  cost  accounting  practices  used  are  applied  in  a  consistent  manner,  based  on  objective 
                         criteria, regardless of the source of funding; 
                     -   the  hourly  rate  is  calculated  using  the  actual  personnel  costs  recorded  in  the  beneficiary’s 
                         accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget categories; 
                         The actual personnel costs may be adjusted by the beneficiary on the basis of budgeted or 
                         estimated  elements.  Those  elements  must  be  relevant  for  calculating  the  personnel  costs, 
                         reasonable and correspond to objective and verifiable information, and 
                     -   the hourly rate is calculated using the number of annual productive hours (see above).

             1.1 The beneficiaries may declare the following types of costs as direct costs related to trans-
             national projects: 
                          direct costs of providing financial support to third parties implementing trans-national 
                           projects

                                   direct personnel costs for the implementation of trans-national projects by the 
                                    beneficiaries: 
                                            basic remuneration (basic salary and complements)  
                                            for non-profit legal entities: additional remuneration (‘bonus payments’) 
                                            costs for natural persons working under a direct contract  
                                            costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment

                                       costs of large research infrastructure. 
            What? These budget categories cover costs for the implementation of trans-national projects. 
            What not? They do not cover the costs for organising the calls (i.e. preparation of the call, 
            selection  of  the  projects  etc.)  or  for  additional  coordination  and  networking  activities  of 
            beneficiaries implementing trans-national project themselves. Such costs are NOT eligible under 
            the ERA-NET grant.  
                     
                       The beneficiaries must use their own funds for such activities. 
                     
            1.2 All costs must normally be declared as actual costs (see Article 5.2(b)).  
                       . 
                        
                Personnel costs (average personnel costs) and costs of internally invoiced goods and services 
                may also be declared as unit cost in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices. 
                    
            1.3 In principle, the same eligibility conditions apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 
                    
            H2020 General MGA).  
                    
            The ERA-NET Cofund MGA has however the following specificities: 
                    
            In some Articles, the conditions in the General MGA must be read as referring to ‘trans-national 
                    
            projects’ (instead of ‘action’). 
            Moreover, there are additional cost eligibility conditions in Article 15 for financial support to third 
            parties (e.g. selection procedure, compliance with national funding rules).  
            Finally, costs for financial support to third parties are usually eligible only AFTER the trans-national 
            projects have ended. 
            1.4 The same calculation rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA).

                           Direct coordination costs for additional activities are eligible, if they correspond to the amount per unit 
                            set out in Annex 2a multiplied by the number of actual years in which the beneficiary has carried out the 
                           ‘additional activities’ described in Annex 1. 
                           Beneficiaries  that  implement  transnational  projects  (partially  or  fully)  themselves  cannot  declare  direct

                         1.2 The costs must be declared as the unit cost fixed by Decision C(2013) 8200                                                                                                                          and indicated 
                         in Annex 2 of the GA (currently EUR 29 000 per beneficiary per year). 
                         In practice, the declaration of costs for additional activities is very simple and almost completely 
                         automatized: The beneficiary must only indicate the number of years (during which such activities 
                         were implemented) and the costs are then automatically calculated by the IT system.  
                         1.3 The costs must fulfil the following eligibility conditions: 
                                          fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the action 
                                           duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(b)) 
                                          be declared for the additional coordination activities described in Annex 1. 
                         Costs for  additional  coordination  activities  are  limited  to  the  beneficiaries  that  carry  out  such 
                         activities. 
                         Beneficiaries that implement trans-national projects can NOT declare any additional coordination 
                         costs. 
                         1.4 They are calculated (automatically by the IT system) as follows: 
                                           amount per unit (EUR 29 000)  x  number of years in which additional activities were carried out 
                         According to General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme, the EU funding for coordination 
                         costs should not exceed 20 % of the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1. 
                          
                                       If  the  additional  activities are  not  properly  implemented as described in Annex 1, the grant may be 
                                reduced (see Articles 7 and 43). 
                                         Example: Beneficiaries make only two meetings on general strategy.

                           C. Indirect costs 
                           Indirect costs are eligible if they are declared on the basis of the flat-rate of 25 % of the eligible direct costs 
                            (see Article 5.2 and Points A and B above), from which are excluded: 
                                     (a)  costs of subcontracting for the implementation of trans-national projects by the beneficiaries;   
                                     (b)  costs of in-kind contributions provided by third parties which are not used on the beneficiary’s 
                                              premises and 
                                     (c)  costs of financial support to third parties implementing trans-national projects.

                           Beneficiaries receiving an operating grant  financed by the EU or Euratom budget cannot declare indirect 
                            costs for the period covered by the operating grant, unless they can demonstrate that the operating grant 
                           does not cover any costs of the action.[…] 
                           11        For the definition, see Article 121(1)(b) of the Financial Regulation: ‘operating grant’ means direct financial contribution, by way of 
                                     donation, from the budget in order to finance the functioning of a body which pursues an aim of general EU interest or has an objective 
                                     forming part of and supporting an EU policy. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Indirect costs (C.): Types of costs — Form — Eligibility conditions — Calculation 
                         For this budget category, in principle the same rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 
                         H2020 General MGA).  
                         The flat-rate is however calculated on the following eligible direct costs: 
                                          direct costs for the implementation of trans-national projects by the beneficiaries  
                                          direct coordination costs for additional activities. 
                                  ‘Direct  costs  of  providing  financial  support  to  third  parties  implementing  trans-national 
                                  projects’ are NOT included.

                                                                       INVOLVED IN THE ACTION 
                           ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                   IN THE ACTION  
                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary for the implementation of the trans-national projects by the beneficiaries, they may: 
                                      -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10); 
                                      -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11); 
                                      -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12); 
                                      -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13); 
                                      -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14). 
                                      -        call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a). 
                           In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission][Agency] and the other 
                           beneficiaries for implementing the action. 
                              
                          
                                             
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
                                parties involved in the action 
                         For ERA-NET Cofund actions, generally the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the 
                         General MGA (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, entities contributing to the joint call for proposals can only participate as beneficiaries or 
                         linked third parties (NOT as other third parties involved in the action).  
                         Linked  third  parties  may  participate  in  all  activities  under  the  action.  Use  of  third  party 
                         resources (i.e. purchasing of goods, works or services (Article 10), in-kind contributions (Articles 
                         11 and 12) or subcontractors (Article 13)) is ONLY allowed for beneficiaries/linked third parties 
                         that  implement  trans-national  projects  (NOT  for  beneficiaries  that  only  provide  financial 
                         support to third parties — with the exception of third parties with authorisation to administer 
                         described in the specific cases below)).  
                          
                         Specific cases (third parties involved in the action): 
                         Authorisation  to  administer  —  Beneficiaries  providing  financial  support  to  third  parties  may 
                         exceptionally  delegate  administrative  tasks  (such  as  the  administration  of  payments  to  the  final 
                         recipients) to other legal entities (third parties) which they created or control and to which they have 
                         granted an ‘authorisation to administer’ (i.e. to handle their administrative affairs).  
                         Sometimes this also includes the handling of the EU contribution. In this case, the beneficiary will use 
                         the  bank  account  of  the  third  party  and  all  payments  made  to  that  account  will  count  for  the 
                         beneficiary. Moreover, the third party will then pass on the EU contribution to thefinal recipientsand 
                         those payments will be registered in the accounts of the third party). 
                         The  services  rendered  by  these  third  party  are  usually  qualified  as  in-kind  contributions  against 
                         payment. If the costs are not recorded in the accounts of the beneficiary (e.g. there is no invoice from 
                         the entity):

                                              The projects must be trans-national projects, involving at least two independent entities from two 
                                              different EU Member States or associated countries; 
                                     (b)  selection procedure and criteria: 
                                              The projects must be selected following a single joint transnational call for proposals. 
                                              The beneficiaries must make the selection through a two-step procedure: 
                                                       -       Step 1: review at national or trans-national level 
                                                       -       Step 2: single international peer review.

                                              independent experts, on the basis of the following award criteria: 
                                                        (a) excellence; 
                                                        (b) impact; 
                                                        (c) quality and efficiency of the implementation. 
                                              Proposals must be ranked according to the evaluation results. The selection must be made on the 
                                              basis of this ranking. 
                                              The selection procedure must be followed by an independent expert observer, who must make a 
                                              report (see Article 20.2a); 
                          
                                     (c)  other conditions: 
                          
                                              In  the  case  of  support  to  entities  that  are  third  parties,  the  beneficiaries  must  ensure  that  [the 
                                              Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti-Fraud 
                                              Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Article 22 and 23 also towards the third parties 
                                              receiving financial support. 
                                              Financial support to entities that are third parties must comply with national funding rules. 
                                              The maximum amount of financial support to a third party and the criteria for determining the 
                                              exact amount under national funding rules are set out in Annex 1.

              15.1.2 In addition, the beneficiaries must: 
                      -   publish a joint call on a dedicated webpage and promote it at national/regional level via their 
                          usual channels of communications to potential proposers; 
                      -   keep the joint call open for at least 60 days; 
                      -   take all lawful steps to ensure confidentiality of information and documents obtained during 
                          the evaluation and selection procedures of the joint call. 
              15.2   Consequences of non-compliance 
              If a beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.1, the costs of the beneficiary for its financial 
              support  to  the  trans-national  projects  or  for  the  implementation  of  its  trans-national  projects  will  be 
              ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
              If the beneficiary breaches its obligations under Article 15.1.2, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
              Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
             
                     
            1. Providing financial support — Implementing trans-national projects 
            A core part of ERA-NET Cofund actions is to provide financial support to third parties (i.e. pass on 
            the EU support they receive via the ERA-NET Cofund grant to recipients that are not party to the 
            GA, also called ‘cascade funding’). 
            In this case, the beneficiaries’ activity consists in providing the financial support, while it is the 
            final  recipients  (third  parties)  that  actually  implement  the  trans-national  research  and/or 
            innovation projects. 
             
                         Beneficiaries  can  in  principle  NOT  also  be  final  recipient  (since  that  is  not  the  purpose  of  a 
                     cascading grant).  
                     However, there are cases where exceptions are permitted (i.e. where the call can be opened also for 
                     other beneficiaries of the EU grant or other departments of the same beneficiary). 
                     In this case, the consortium will be asked during grant preparation to: 
                            identify the beneficiaries which can apply for funding under the co-funded call for proposals 
                            explain the measures to mitigate (potential) conflict of interest or unequal treatment of 
                             applicants and 
                            reflect this fully in their description of the action (Annex 1 to the GA), both in the context of 
                             the description of the co-funded call and in relation to the monitoring of the trans-national 
                             projects. 
             
                     Moreover, beneficiaries must set up information barriers (‘Chinese walls’) to prevent exchanges or 
                     communication that could lead to conflicts of interest or unequal treatment of applicants  and ensure 
                     independent and fair complaints procedures. 
                     Costs can be declared ONLY by the beneficiary providing the financial support, NOT by the final 
                     recipient receiving the financial support (even if it is at the same time beneficiary of the grant and 
                     can therefore declare other costs). 
                     If  the  call  is  NOT  open  other  beneficiaries  of  the  EU  grant  or  other  departments  of  the  same 
                     beneficiary, this should also be explicitly mentioned in the description of the action (Annex 1 to the 
                     GA).

            ERA-NET grants can however also include actions which are implemented by the beneficiaries 
            themselves, if foreseen in the work programme.  
             
                   Article  15  contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 15.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
             Article 15.1.2).  
               
             
                 . 
            2. Additional cost eligibility condition: Trans-national projects 
                  
            The projects must be trans-national (i.e. they must involve at least two independent entities from 
              
            two different EU Member States or H2020 associated countries), both in case of: 
                   financial support to third parties and 
              
                   implementation of the projects by the beneficiaries themselves.  
              
            Note that additional eligibility  conditions  may  apply  in  specific  cases  concerning  the  minimum 
              
            number of independent entities (including entities from third countries).  
             
            3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Two-step selection procedure 
            The  beneficiaries  must  select  the  trans-national  projects  according  to  a  two-step  procedure, 
            ensuring that: 
                  only entities that are eligible for funding under the national funding rules are invited to 
                    Step 2 and  
                  consortia can balance the requested funding and available funding per participating EU 
                    Member State and H2020 associated country between Steps 1 and 2. 
             
            4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Independent experts — Observer 
            In  addition  to  expert  evaluators,  the  beneficiaries  must  appoint  an  independent  expert  as  an 
            observer to verify that the selection procedure (and, in particular, the peer review evaluation and 
            the ranking) meets the requirements of Article 15.  
                The observer’s report must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of the periodic report (see 
                Article 20.3). 
             
            5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Ranking list(s) — Joint selection list 
            The beneficiaries must base their selection (joint selection list) on the order of the ranking list 
            (or the ranking lists, if there are different topics). 
                If proposals have identical scores, the proposals coming from participating EU Member States 
                or H2020 associated countries with still available funding can be given precedence, in order to 
                maximise the number of selected projects. 
                The ranking list(s) and the joint selection list must be submitted by the coordinator, as part of 
                the periodic report (see Article 20.3).

            6. Additional cost eligibility condition: Compliance with national funding rules 
            If the beneficiaries provide financial support to third parties, the support must comply with the 
            applicable national funding rules. 
                The trans-national projects must have been implemented (by the recipients) in compliance 
                with those rules.  
                Moreover, the beneficiaries must ensure that costs are checked and that their payments are 
                made in compliance with those rules (and certify this; see Article 20.4). 
             
            7. Additional cost eligibility condition: Conditions for support set out in Annex 1 — 
               Maximum amount of financial support  
            If the beneficiaries provide financial support to third parties, the beneficiaries may not exceed the 
            maximum amount of financial support set out in Annex 1 and must apply the criteria set out in 
            Annex 1 for fixing the exact amount of funding.  
            This information must already be part of the proposal (see the proposal templates).  
                For both, the beneficiaries should rely on the applicable national funding rules. If the national 
                rules do not specify a maximum amount, they must enter the amount of their part of the call 
                budget.

                           If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the [Commission][Agency] may apply 
                           any of the measures described in Chapter 6.

                         What & When? For ERA-NET Cofund actions, the coordinator must — once the trans-national 
                         projects have been selected — submit to the Commission/Agency a list of all the projects with 
                         certain information.

            2. Deliverable: Information on cumulative expenditure incurred 
            What & When? The coordinator must submit to the Commission/Agency — on a yearly basis — 
            information on the cumulative expenditure incurred by the consortium  
            How? In practice, this mandatory declaration for ERA-NET Cofund (see Article 20.5) is handled as 
            deliverable and must be uploaded directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal.  
                It does NOT need to be set out in Annex 1 (since legally speaking the obligation is not based

               incurred by the beneficiaries from the starting date of the action. 
               This information is required for the Commission’s accounting purposes and will not be used to calculate the

             1. Reports 
             What & When? For ERA-NET Cofund actions, the coordinator must submit a periodic report 
             after the end of each reporting period (including the final one). 
             Before the end of the action, these are only technical reports, with information on the technical 
             implementation. 
                 List of documents for the technical reports: 
                         explanation of the work carried out 
                         overview of the progress 
                         summary for publication 
                         questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested) 
                         ranking list of the projects 
                         observer report on the evaluation 
             ERA-NET Cofund > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 20                                                                664 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019             ERA-NET Cofund MGA 
                       joint selection list 
                       commitment on availability of funds (Annex 7) 
                       statement on the use of the previous pre-financing instalment (Annex 8). 
            NO financial reporting is needed during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final 
            report). The coordinator only has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre-
            financing instalment (which includes the request for further pre-financing payments; only the first 
            pre-financing payment is automatic; see Annex 8). 
            How? Each periodic report must be prepared by the coordinator and the other beneficiaries 
            together, directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal). 
             
            2. Reporting periods 
            ERA-NET  Cofund  actions  are  normally  divided  into  2  reporting  periods  with  2  pre-financing 
            payments  (or  exceptionally  3  reporting  periods  with  3  pre-financing  payments,  if  the 
            Commission/Agency does not have sufficient payment credits to pay  the  entire  amount  as  a 
            second pre-financing payment; see Article 21). 
            The first (and, if there are 2 pre-financing payments, also the second) reporting period triggers a 
            periodic report. 
             
            3. Information on cumulative expenditure incurred 
            Since  reporting  periods  in  ERA-NET  Cofund  actions  normally  exceed  18  months  and  ERA-NET 
            Cofund grants are normally above EUR 5 000 000 with a pre-financing payment, all ERA-NET 
            grants contain this clause. 
            The declaration is normally handled as deliverable (see Article 19).

                           The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.

              In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the

            1. Payments to be made — No interim payments 
            ERA-NET Cofund actions normally are divided into 2 reporting periods (see Article 20.2) with 2 
            pre-financing payments (— unless the action is exceptionally divided into 3 reporting periods with 
            3  pre-financing  payments  because  the  Commission/Agency  does  not  have  sufficient  payment 
            credits). 
            There are NO interim payments, but the second pre-financing payment (after the end of the first 
            reporting period, i.e. after the evaluation of the trans-national projects) provides beneficiaries with 
            the necessary funds to support or implement the trans-national projects. 
                The second (or third) pre-financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requested by the 
                coordinator via a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (see Article 20).  
                In  this  statement,  the  beneficiaries  must  simply  declare  how  much  of  the  previous  pre-
                financing  was  used  up,  not  how  much  costs  were  incurred  (since  ERA-NET  Cofund  pre-
                financing is NOT linked to financial reporting). 
            The balance is paid when the action ends (after the submission of financial reports).  
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
            Pre-financing payment 
            How much? Typically (and depending on the availability of EU budget credits), the amounts of 
            the pre-financing payments for ERA-NET Cofund actions are as follows: 
                   for the first pre-financing payment: between 10% and 30 % of the maximum grant amount  
                   for  the  second pre-financing payment: between 60 % and 80% of the maximum grant 
                    amount. 
               If the GA provides for a 3 pre-financing payments, then the amount is divided as follows: 
                       30 % for the first pre-financing payment 
                       30 % for the second pre-financing payment 
                       30 % for the third pre-financing payment. 
                
                     The second/third pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to the statement on use of the 
                 previous pre-financing instalment — the previous pre-financing was not fully used: 
                        if 70% or more of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing is 
                         paid in full 
                        if less than 70% of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing will 
                         be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 70%.

             1. Participants: Coordinator — Beneficiaries — Linked third parties — Third parties 
                 involved in the action 
             PCP/PPI uses in principle the same concepts for participants as the General MGA (i.e. coordinator, 
             beneficiaries, linked third parties, etc). 
             However,  all  entities  contributing  financially  to  the  PCP  or  PPI  procurement  budget  MUST 
             participate as beneficiaries or linked third parties in the GA (NOT as other third parties involved in 
             the action; see Article 8). They form the buyers group.   
              
                          Linked  third  parties  —  Linked  third  parties  are  allowed  to  fully  participate  in  the  action,  like 
                      beneficiaries.  They  will  therefore  be  treated  for  many  issues  (including  cost  eligibility;  see  Article  6.3 
                      H2020 General MGA ) like beneficiaries.

                         1. PCP/PPI actions 
                         What? PCP/PPI funds: 
                                     one single joint public procurement of research and development (R&D) services (PCP) or 
                                            one joint or several coordinated public procurements for innovative solutions (PPI)  
                                  AND 
                                     related additional coordination and networking activities. 
                         For PCP actions, it must be only one PCP per GA; for PPI actions, it can be one joint or several 
                         coordinated PPIs per GA.  
                         The  additional  activities  must  relate  to  the  joint  call  for  tender,  including  coordination  and 
                         networking activities  needed  to  prepare,  manage  and follow-up the PCP/PPI procurement and 
                         other coordination and networking activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side 
                         activities (see General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                                           Examples: activities  that  aim  to  remove  barriers  to  introducing  an  innovative  solution  on  the  market 
                                           (including standardisation, certification and regulation); activities that prepare the ground for cooperation 
                                           on future PCP or PPI projects.  
                                Coordination activities needed to coordinate the PCP/PPI procurement are mandatory. Other 
                                additional activities are optional (e.g. other coordination and networking activities to embed 
                                the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities).  
                         Normally, PCP/PPI grants are multi-beneficiary grants; exceptionally they can be mono-beneficiary 
                         grants for ‘sole participants’ (see General Annex C and D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                         PCP/PPI actions are funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020 (e.g. SEC-09-FCT-2017).  
                         The possibility to have several coordinated PPIs was introduced with GA version 4.0 but is also 
                         open to older grant agreements.

                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
                           party)] and budget category (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14]). [OPTION to be used if Article 9 or 14 a applies:

                         1. Estimated budget 
                         When submitting the proposal with the estimated eligible costs for PCP/PPI actions, the consortium 
                         must decide who will pay the PCP/PPI subcontracts (and who may — by consequence — declare 
                         the subcontracting costs), i.e.: 
                                          either  the  lead  procurer  (centralised  payment;  the  consortium  has  a  common  jointly-
                                           committed budget; the lead procurer is mandated to sign the subcontracts and pays all 
                                           subcontractors; see Article 13). 
                                  OR 
                                          the members of the buyers group (the individual members of the buyers group pay the 
                                           subcontractors pro rata; see Article 13). 
                          
                         2. Budget categories 
                         The PCP/PPI  MGA uses its own budget categories. 
                                  Budget categories of the PCP/PPI  MGA: 
                                                  direct costs of PCP/PPI subcontracting  
                                                   These are the costs for procuring the R&D services (in the case of PCP) or the innovative 
                                                   solutions (in the case of PPI) (i.e. the estimated procurement price).  
                                                   Only the beneficiary(ies) that pay the PCP/PPI suppliers can declare PCP/PPI subcontracting 
                                                   costs.  Who  actually  pays  the  PCP/PPI  suppliers  depends  on  the  choice  made  by  the 
                                                   consortium when submitting the estimated eligible costs: either the lead procurer or the 
                                                   members of the buyers group (see Article 4). 
                                                  costs of related additional coordination and networking activities 
                                                                    direct personnel costs for related additional coordination and networking activities 
                                                                                      costs for employees (or equivalent) 
                                                                                      costs for natural persons working under a direct contract 
                                                                                      costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment 
                                                                                      costs for SME owners without salary

                                       personnel  costs  for  providing  trans-national  access  to  research 
                                        infrastructure 
                               direct  costs  of  subcontracting  for  related  additional  coordination  and  networking 
                                activities 
                               other direct costs for related additional coordination and networking activities 
                                       travel costs and related subsistence allowances 
                                       equipment costs 
                                       costs of other goods and services 
                                       capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure 
                               indirect costs for related additional coordination and networking activities 
                               specific cost categories (if option applies). 
                Thus, the PCP/PPI  MGA does NOT have:        
                      direct costs of providing financial support to third parties. 
             
                       The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs 
                 (Article 5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20

            1. Reimbursement rates 
            How much? The PCP/PPI, normally uses the same reimbursement rates as the General MGA 
            (100% for research and innovation actions (RIA) and 70% or 100% for innovation actions (IA) 
            actions; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA), unless  the call provides exceptionally for another 
            rate. 
             
            2. Cost forms 
            The PCP/PPI MGA uses the same cost forms as the General MGA (i.e. actual costs, unit costs 
            and flat rate costs; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA).

                           6.2                Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                           Costs are eligible if they comply with the general conditions (see above) and the specific conditions set out 
                           below for each of the following budget categories: 
                                     A.  Direct costs of [PCP][PPI] subcontracting 
                                     B.  Costs for related additional coordination and networking activities 
                           ‘Direct costs’ are costs that are directly linked to the action implementation and can therefore be attributed 
                           to it directly. They must not include any indirect costs (see Point B.4 below). 
                          
                            ‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
                           attributed directly to it. 
                                            
                         1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The PCP/PPI MGA has its own budget categories. Some of them cover however the same 
                         types of costs as the General MGA, with the same eligibility conditions and calculation rules 
                         (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA). 
                         For ease of reference, the annotations for Article 6.2 will summarise — for each budget category 
                         — the information necessary to establish the eligible costs, i.e.  
                                  1.  types of costs covered by the budget category 
                                  2.  cost form under which the costs must be declared (i.e. actual costs, unit costs, flat rate)  
                                  3.  eligibility conditions 
                                  4.  how the costs must be calculated.

                         1.1 What? This budget category covers the costs of the PCP/PPI procurement (i.e. the price paid 
                         and the related taxes; for VAT, see Article 6.5). 
                                  Only  costs  of  R&D  services  or  innovative  solutions  subcontracted  by  the  beneficiaries  are 
                                  eligible.  Costs  related  to  R&D  and  innovation  activities  carried  out  by  the  beneficiaries 
                                  themselves are NOT eligible in PCP/PPI actions. 
                         What not? Indirect costs for the PCP subcontracting are not reimbursed. 
                         1.2 These costs must be declared as actual costs (i.e. on the basis of the prices actually paid) 
                         (see Article 5.2(a)).  
                         1.3 They must fulfil the following eligibility conditions: 
                                          fulfil  the  general  conditions  for  costs  to  be  eligible  (i.e.  incurred  during  the  action 
                                           duration, necessary, linked to the action, etc.; see Article 6.1(a)) 
                                          be incurred for the PCP/PPI subcontracting described in Annex 1 
                                          fulfil the additional cost eligibility conditions set out in Article 13.1.1.  
                         1.4 There is no specific calculation method. The costs must correspond to the eligible costs 
                         actually incurred.

                                              the work is organised, the tasks that are performed and the premises where they are performed;

              Calculation 
              Personnel costs must be calculated by the beneficiaries as follows: 
                     {{hourly rate 
                     multiplied by 
                     number of actual hours worked on the related additional coordination and networking activities}, 
                     plus   
                     for non-profit legal entities: additional remuneration to personnel assigned to the related additional coordination and 
                     networking activities under the conditions set out above (Point B.1.1)}. 
              The number of actual hours declared for a person must be identifiable and verifiable (see Article 18). 
              The total number of hours declared in EU or Euratom grants, for a person for a year, cannot be higher than 
              the annual productive hours used for the calculations of the hourly rate. Therefore, the maximum number of 
             hours that can be declared for the grant are: 
                     {number of annual productive hours for the year (see below) 
                     minus 
                     total number of hours declared by the beneficiary, for that person for that year, for other EU or Euratom grants}. 
              The ‘hourly rate’ is one of the following: 
               (a)  for personnel costs declared as actual costs (i.e. budget categories B.1.1, B.1.2, B.1.3 [and B.1.6]): 
                   the hourly rate is calculated per full financial year  as follows: 
                     {actual annual personnel costs (excluding additional remuneration) for the person 
                     divided by 
                     number of annual productive hours}. 
                     using the  personnel costs and the number of annual productive hours for each full financial year 
                     covered  by  the  reporting  period  concerned.  If  a  financial  year  is  not  closed  at  the  end  of  the 
                     reporting  period,  the  beneficiaries  must  use  the  hourly  rate  of  the  last  closed  financial  year 
                     available. 
                     For the ‘number of annual productive hours’, the beneficiaries may choose one of the following: 
                         (i)  ‘fixed number of hours’: 1 720 hours for persons working full time (or corresponding pro-
                               rata for persons not working full time); 
                         (ii)  ‘individual annual productive hours’: the total number of hours worked by the person in the 
                               year for the beneficiary, calculated as follows: 
                                 {annual workable hours of the person (according to the employment contract, applicable collective 
                                 labour agreement or national law) 
                                 plus 
                                 overtime worked 
                                 minus 
                                 absences (such as sick leave and special leave)}.

                             ‘Annual workable hours’ means the period during which the personnel must be working, at 
                             the employer’s disposal and carrying out his/her activity or duties under the employment 
                             contract, applicable collective labour agreement or national working time legislation. 
                             If  the  contract  (or  applicable  collective  labour  agreement  or  national  working  time 
                             legislation) does not allow to determine the annual workable hours, this option cannot be 
                             used; 
                         (iii) ‘standard annual productive hours’: the standard number of annual hours generally applied 
                               by the beneficiary for its personnel in accordance with its usual cost accounting practices. 
                               This number must be at least 90 % of the ‘standard annual workable hours’. 
                               If  there is no applicable reference for the standard annual workable hours, this option 
                               cannot be used. 
                          For all options, the actual time spent on parental leave by a person assigned to the related 
                          additional coordination and networking activities may be deducted from the number of annual 
                          productive hours. 
                    As an alternative, beneficiaries may calculate the hourly rate per month, as follows: 
                  
                        {actual monthly personnel cost (excluding additional remuneration) for the person 
                         
                        divided by 
                         
                        {number of annual productive hours / 12}} 
                 
                        using  the  personnel  costs  for  each  month  and  (one  twelfth  of)  the  annual  productive  hours 
                        calculated according to either option (i) or option (iii) above, i.e.:  
                         
                            - fixed number of hours; 
                                 
                            - standard annual productive hours. 
                         
                        Time spent on parental leave may not be deducted when calculating the hourly rate per month. 
                        However, beneficiaries may declare personnel costs incurred in periods of parental leave in 
                        proportion to the time the person worked on the action in that financial year. 
                         
                        If  parts  of  a  basic  remuneration  are  generated  over  a  period  longer  than  a  month,  the 
                        beneficiaries may include only the share which is generated in the month (irrespective of the 
                        amount actually paid for that month). 
                  
                    Each beneficiary must use only one option (per full financial year or per month) for during each full 
                    financial year;  
                (b)  for personnel costs declared on the basis of unit costs (i.e. budget categories B.1.1, B.1.2, B.1.4, 
                    B.1.5 [and B.1.6]): the hourly rate is one of the following: 
                     -   for SME owners or beneficiaries that are natural persons: the hourly rate set out in Annex 2a 
                         (see Points B.1.4 and B.1.5 above), or 
                     -   for personnel costs declared on the basis of the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices: 
                         the  hourly  rate  calculated  by  the  beneficiary  in  accordance  with  its  usual  cost  accounting 
                         practices, if: 
                             -   the  cost  accounting  practices  used  are  applied  in  a  consistent  manner,  based  on 
                                 objective criteria, regardless of the source of funding; 
                             -   the  hourly  rate  is  calculated  using  the  actual  personnel  costs  recorded  in  the 
                                 beneficiary’s accounts, excluding any ineligible cost or costs included in other budget

                  Personnel costs (average personnel costs) and costs of internally invoiced goods and services 
                  may also be declared as unit cost in accordance with the usual cost accounting practices.  
                  Personnel costs of beneficiaries that are SME owners or natural persons not receiving a salary 
                                                                                                       119

                       This concerns only beneficiaries that are SMEs (e.g. contracting authorities or contracting 
                       entities that are SMEs), not PCP/PPI subcontractors that are SMEs. 
             1.3 The same eligibility conditions apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General 
             MGA).

            managing monitoring and following-up the PCP/PPI procurement, costs for other coordination and 
            networking activities to embed the PCP/PPI into a wider set of demand side activities).

                1. The evaluation of the PCP or PPI tender is subcontracted or undertaken by in-house consultants under the 
                responsibility of the consortium participants.  
                2. Resources or equipment for testing innovative solutions are made available by end-users of the targeted 
                innovative solutions (in the form of action tasks undertaken by linked third parties or as in-kind contributions of 
                third parties). 
                3. Costs for validation and testing of solutions provided by the subcontractors.  
            1.4 The same calculation rules apply as in the General MGA (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA). 
            According to General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme, the costs of additional coordination 
            and networking activities are eligible up to a maximum amount of 30% (for PCP)/50% (for PPI) of 
            the total requested grant amount. For each GA, this ceiling is fixed in the GA (see Article 6.2.B). 
            Thus, the amount of EU funding for additional coordination and networking activities does NOT 
            change, even if the costs actually incurred for PCP/PPI subcontracting end up being less than 
            initially  estimated  (e.g.  if  the  buyers  group  is  able  to  procure  at  a  better  price  than  it  had 
            budgeted).

                                                                      INVOLVED IN THE ACTION 
                           ARTICLE 8 — RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTION — THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED 
                                                                      IN THE ACTION 
                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action. 
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may: 
                                     -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10); 
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment (see Article 11); 
                                     -        use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge (see Article 12); 
                                     -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13); 
                                     -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14). 
                                     -        call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a). 
                           In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission][Agency] and the other 
                           beneficiaries for implementing the action. 
                            
                          
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources — Use of third party resources — Third 
                                parties involved in the action 
                         For PCP/PPI actions, generally the same rules on third party involvement apply as in the General 
                         MGA (see Article 8 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, entities contributing financially to the joint procurement budget can only participate as 
                         beneficiaries or linked third parties (NOT as other third parties involved in the action). They form 
                         the buyers group. 
                         Moreover, certain third party resources (i.e. purchasing of goods, works or services (Article 10), 
                         in-kind contributions (Articles 11 and 12)) are ONLY allowed for additional coordination and 
                         networking activities. 
                                  Example:  Equipment  needed  for  testing  and  validating  solutions  is  provided  by  a  third  party  as  in-kind 
                                  contribution. 
                         By contrast, subcontracting (Article 13) is possible both for PCP/PPI subcontracting and related 
                         additional coordination and networking activities.  
                         Linked third parties (Article 14) may participate in all activities under the action. 
                         In  addition,  PCP/PPI  actions  often  have  other interested third parties (preferred partners), 
                         which are neither lead procurer nor part of the buyers group nor linked third parties nor third 
                         parties providing in-kind contributions, but which have a special interest in closely following the 
                         PCP and may therefore be mentioned in Annex 1 (e.g. entities involved in the related additional 
                         networking  activities;  other    potential  buyers  for  the  solutions  that  have  expressed  a  special 
                         interest in the PCP/PPI).

                           ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                           13.1  [OPTION 1 for PCP: Rules for the pre-commercial procurement of research and development 
                           services 
                           13.1.1 The beneficiaries will award subcontracts for the PCP research and development services (‘PCP 
                            R&D services’) that are necessary to address the ‘common challenge’ set out in Annex 1. 
                           The subcontracts must be awarded as one single joint procurement by the beneficiaries concerned (i.e. the 
                           ‘lead procurer’ and the ‘buyers group’). 
                           The  lead  procurer  must  be  a  ‘contracting  authority’  or  ‘contracting  entity’  as  defined  in  Directives 
                           2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU).   
                           The buyers group must constitute a ‘total jointly committed budget’ for payment of the subcontracts. 
                           The ‘buyers group’, the ‘lead procurer’, the services to be subcontracted (for each implementation phase 
                            (‘PCP phase’)), their estimated costs and the estimated financial contribution per beneficiary to the ‘total 
                           jointly committed budget’ must be set out in Annex 1. The estimated costs of PCP subcontracting per 
                            beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2. 
                           [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
                           only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 37).] 
                           The beneficiaries concerned must — throughout the action —: 
                                       -      guarantee equal treatment of tenderers and subcontractors and avoid any restrictions or distortions 
                                              of competition;   
                                       -      avoid any conflict of interest (see Article 35); 
                          
                                       -      allow for all communications to be made in English (and any additional language(s) they may have 
                                              chosen). 
                           The subcontracts for pre-commercial procurement must provide for the following: 
                                     -        the ownership, by the subcontractors, of the intellectual property rights on the results that they 
                                              generate; 
                                     -        the right of the buyers to access results — on a royalty-free basis — for their own use; 
                                     -        the right of the buyers to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non-exclusive licences to 
                                              third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable conditions — (without the right to 
                                              sub-licence); 
                                     -        the obligation of the subcontractors to transfer back to the buyers the ownership of intellectual 
                                              property  generated  by  subcontractors  during  the  PCP,  if  subcontractors  fail  to  commercially 
                                              exploit the results within the period set out in the subcontract; 
                                     -        the right of the buyers to publish — at the time of the contract award notice — the identity of the 
                                              winning tenderers and a project summary provided by the winning tenderers, and to publish — 
                                              after R&D has finished and after consulting the subcontractors — summaries of the results as well 
                                              as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed the last phase of the PCP. 
                            The beneficiaries concerned must ensure that the majority of the research and development work done by 
                            the subcontractor(s) (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
                            associated countries (‘place of performance obligation’).

                    (i)   Step 1: make a ‘contract notice’, which 
                             -   is published by the lead procurer in the Official Journal of the European Union (in 
                                 English and any additional language(s) chosen by the buyers group); 
                             -   specifies  that  the  procurement  concerns  a  pre-commercial  procurement  that  is 
                                 exempted  from  Directives  2004/18/EC  (or  2014/24/EU)  and  2004/17/EC  (or

                             -   specifies a time-limit for receipt of tenders of at least two months; 
             
                             -   allows  for  the  submission  of  tenders  in  English  (and  any  additional  language(s) 
                                 chosen by the buyers group);

                             -   identifies the lead procurer, the buyers group and, if applicable, third parties involved 
                                 in the PCP; 
                             -   informs  potential  tenderers  about  the  outcome  and  list  of  Q&As  of  the  market 
                                 consultation (see above);

                                                            specifications (see above), according to best value for money criteria and ensuring that the 
                                                            price corresponds to market conditions; 
                                          (iii)             Step 3: award the subcontracts to a minimum of three tenderers offering best value for 
                                                            money and a price corresponding to market conditions. 
                                                            The framework agreements (one agreement per selected tenderer) must be signed by the lead 
                                                            procurer and set out the terms and conditions that govern the specific contracts. 
                                                            The specific contracts (one agreement per selected tenderer and PCP phase) must be signed 
                                                            by the lead procurer and set out the details of the PCP R&D services purchased by each 
                                                            buyer (in particular, their quantity and price); 
                                           (iv)             Step  4:  make  a  ‘contract  award  notice’    which  is  published  —  within  48  days  after 
                                                            conclusion of the framework agreements — by the lead procurer in the Official Journal of the

                                 (c)  For the ‘contract implementation stage’: 
                                             (i)             monitor that the PCP R&D services are implemented in compliance with the objectives of the 
                                                            action set out in Annex 1;

                                                            budget indicated in Annex 2; 
                                          (iii)             ensure payment of the subcontractors. 
                            The beneficiaries concerned must ensure that the right of the Commission [and the Agency], the European

                          In PCP actions, the beneficiaries award PCP subcontracts for research and development services 
                          that are necessary to address a common challenge set out in Annex 1 (PCP R&D services). ‘PCP

             subcontract’ thus means a contract for the purchase of R&D services (identified in Annex 1 as 
             action task). 
              
                           For  the  purposes  of  the  GA,  the  suppliers  selected  as  a  result  of  the  PCP/PPI  call  for  tender  are 
                     considered  ‘subcontractors’  and  the  contracts  with  them  are  ‘subcontracts’.  They  do  NOT  become 
                     beneficiaries of the GA. 
                      
                  Characteristics of subcontracting: 
                        .  Joint  subcontracting by some or all of the beneficiaries and linked third parties (buyers 
                            group), with a joint procurement in 3 phases  
                            The  buyers  group  is  the  group  that  finances  and  undertakes  together  the  joint  PCP 
                            procurement (i.e. normally the entities that need the purchased service/solution or central 
                            purchasing bodies).  
                                For PCP/PPI actions, it must normally be made up of: 
                                       a minimum of 2 public procurers (i.e. ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting 
                                          entities’  as  defined in the EU public procurement Directives  2014/24/EU and 
                                                        120
                                          2014/25/EU        )  
                                          Any entity that fits the definition of a contracting authority or contracting entity 
                                          as defined in those Directives is considered a public procurer — regardless of 
                                          whether the EU public procurement Directives themselves apply or not.  
                                               Example: International entities such as European Research Infrastructure Consortia 
                                               (ERICs) that fit as majority publicly owned entities the public procurement Directives 
                                               definition of contracting authorities, but to which those Directives do not apply, are 
                                               considered public procurers that can participate in the buyers group and are eligible 
                                               for funding under PCP/PPI actions. 
                                       that are established in two different EU Member States or H2020 associated 
                                          countries (see General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                                     This is in addition to the general minimum requirements for participation for Horizon 
                                     2020 actions (i.e. minimum of 3 independent legal entities established in different 
                                     EU Member States or H2020 associated countries; see General Annexes C and D to 
                                     the  H2020  Work  Programme  —  unless  the  work  programme/call  allows  for  the 
                                     participation of sole participants). 
                                Procurers that are not public procurers, but provide services of public interest and share 
                                the same procurement need may also be part of the buyers group. 
                                          Example: a group of a minimum of two public hospitals from two different EU Member 
                                          States or H2020 associated countries could be joined by a private hospital or NGO (e.g. 
                                          Médecins sans frontiers). 
                                        The buyers group is NOT open to other types of procurers that are not providing 
                                        services of public interest, even if they may share the same procurement need 
                                        (e.g. private company procurers like IBM or EADS that are not providing hospital 
                                        services cannot be funded as buyers in the above example of a consortium of 
                                        hospital procurers, even if they would be interested to procure the same software 
                                        system as the hospital procurers). 
                                        Such other entities may be involved in the action as:

                                                beneficiaries/linked third parties responsible for other action tasks related 
                                                 additional coordination and networking activities (e.g. certification bodies, 
                                                 end-users) 
                                                third parties providing in-kind contributions

                                            and have no other type of conflict of interest. 
                            The  PCP  procurement  is  split  in  3  phases  (solution  design,  prototyping,  original 
                            development  and  testing  of  a  limited  set  of  ‘first’  products  or  services)  which  are 
                            implemented  via  3  different  specific  contracts  (under  the  overall  PCP  framework 
                            agreement). 
                                The buyers group must select multiple competing subcontractors (with a minimum of 3 
                                subcontractors for the first PCP phase). At the end of each phase, an intermediate 
                                evaluation will take place to identify the subcontractors that successfully completed the 
                                phase. A call-off will be made to select the subcontractors with the best value for money 
                                offers for the next phase.  
                                In order to obtain a competitive supply chain as a result of the PCP, the buyers group 
                                must plan the budget distribution across the PCP phases so that there is enough budget 
                                for minimum 2 subcontractors in the last PCP phase 3. 
                                The tenders for the PCP call for tender must therefore contain: 
                                         a detailed offer for phase 1 
                                         the goals, plans and unit price conditions for phases 2 and 3. 
                           Concerns R&D services addressing a common challenge (i.e. a specific procurement 
                            need that is part of the mid-to-long-term innovation plans of the buyers group).  
                            The  common challenge  may  have  several  facets  or  building  blocks,  as  long  as  all  the 
                            beneficiaries in the buyers group share the need for all of them and are willing to co-finance 
                            all of them.  
                                If the common challenge is split in several sub-challenges on which different vendors 
                                can compete, the minimum requirements of 3 subcontractors for phase 1 and 2 for 
                                phase 3 applies per sub-challenge, in order to obtain a competitive supply chain for 
                                each sub-challenge. 
                            The procurement must be for an R&D services contract (i.e. a contract with the objective to 
                            provide R&D services; see also General Annex E to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                                If required for the provisioning of the R&D services and required by the procurement 
                                need of the buyers group, the PCP may include the purchase of supplies (such as the 
                                limited volume of prototypes or first test-products resulting from the R&D). 
                                          Example: A traffic authority may need to acquire more environmentally-friendly tarmac 
                                          that was developed and installed during the PCP on a test strip of the road, because the 
                                          old tarmac was destroyed during the PCP in order to test the new variant and the traffic 
                                          authority needs to carry out further testing on the tarmac after the PCP is done. 
                                This  does  NOT  extend  to  ‘quantity  production’  or  ‘supply  to  establish  commercial 
                                viability or to recover research and development costs’ (— otherwise it will not be a an 
                                                                                                                  121

                                Supplies can NOT constitute the majority of the contract value. 
                          All  subcontracts paid from one common budget for the procurement (common jointly-
                           committed budget)  
                            This budget is based on the financial commitments of the beneficiaries and linked third 
                            parties in the buyers group and must correspond to the call-for-tender-budget (i.e. the 
                            estimated procurement price = estimated direct costs of PCP subcontracting; see Articles 4 
                            and 6.2.A).  
                                                         
             121
                   PCP procurements are exempted from the WTO GPA (since according to Annex IV of the WTO GPA R&D services 
                  are excluded from the scope of the GPA, i.e. both from the national treatment obligation and from the non-
                  discrimination obligation).

                           Joint procurement procedure (i.e. joint call for tender, joint evaluation of offers and joint 
                            award) is coordinated and led by one beneficiary (lead procurer) 
                            The lead procurer may be part of the buyers group or not (i.e. it may also be a beneficiary 
                            that is NOT part of the buyers group). 
                                Example: the lead procurer can be a central purchasing body that carries out the procurement for 
                                the buyers group, but does not contribute financially to the common jointly committed budget). 
                            The lead procurer must be a ‘contracting authority’ or ‘contracting entity’ as defined in the 
                                                                                                       122

                           Subcontracts signed by the lead procurer, in the name and on behalf of the buyers group 
                            The  lead  procurer  must  be  mandated  by  the  buyers  group  in  the  joint  procurement 
                            agreement. 
                            The subcontracts to be signed are: 
                                    a framework contract with each selected subcontractor, covering the whole PCP and  
                                    specific contracts with each selected subcontractor, for each PCP phase. 
                           Subcontracts implemented by the selected subcontractors (PCP implementation)  
                           Subcontractors are paid either by the lead procurer or (pro rata) by the members of the 
                            buyers  group  (based  on  their  individual  financial  contribution  to  the  jointly-committed 
                            budget),  depending  on  the  choice  of  the  consortium  when  it  submitted  the  estimated 
                            eligible costs (see Article 4). 
             PCP subcontracting is NOT restricted to a limited part of the action (since the PCP subcontracting 
             is the main goal of PCP actions). 
             There can only be one PCP per PCP action. 
                      Article 13.1 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 13.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
               Article 13.1.2).  
                
                    . 
             2.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Procurers,  tasks  and  costs  set  out  in 
                     
                 Annexes 1 and 2 — No simplified approval procedure 
                
             Annexes  1  and  2  must  clearly  identify  the  common  challenge  (types  of  R&D  services  to  be 
             procured), the lead procurer, the buyers group and the common jointly-committed budget and the 
                
             estimated costs per beneficiary, already at the moment of the signature of the GA. Any changes at 
                
             a  later  stage  (e.g.  after  the  preparation  stage  of  the  project)  are  only  possible  through  an 
             amendment; see Article 55). 
                
                  At  the  end  of  the  preparation  stage  of  the  project,  the  consortium  must  confirm  (in  the 
                  periodic report; see Article 20.3) that the lead procurer has not changed and that the buyers 
                  group’s commitments to the common jointly-committed budget are still valid — or whether 
                  changes are needed, based on the feedback of the preparation stage of the project (e.g. the 
                  open market consultation).

                For  PCP  subcontracting,  there  is  NO  simplified  approval  procedure  (contrary  to  the 
                subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities; see Article 13.2).  
             
            3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Place of performance obligation 
            The majority (i.e. at least 50%) of the total amount of work done by the subcontractors for the 
            PCP implementation (including the work of the main researchers) must be performed in EU 
            Member States or H2020 associated countries (as defined in Article 25 H2020 General MGA). 
                This includes R&D and operational activities (e.g. research, development, testing, certifying 
                solutions, etc.). 
            The beneficiaries must require subcontractors to comply with this place of performance obligation, 
            including when subcontractors subcontract work out themselves. This obligation must however be 
            clearly set out in the Framework Agreement (see below). 
             
            4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Procurement procedure — Best value for 
               money — Price corresponding to market conditions 
            The beneficiaries must base the PCP subcontracts on the best value for money (see Articles 10 
            and 13 H2020 General MGA).  
                    The tenders for the PCP call for tender must therefore contain: 
                           a detailed offer for phase 1 
                           the goals, plans and unit price conditions for phases 2 and 3. 
                    The offers for the call-offs for phase 2 and 3 must contain the detailed offer for phase 2 
                    and phase 3. The price offered for phase 2 and 3 must be based on the unit prices in the 
                    framework agreement 
            The GA foresees additional rules, i.e. that: 
                  the price must correspond to market conditions  
                    This means that the price must normally be lower than the exclusive development price 
                    (since subcontractors obtain intellectual property ownership rights (IPRs)). 
                AND 
                  a specific procurement procedure must be followed. 
                   The main elements of this procedure are as follows:  
                           the  buyers  group  and  the  lead  procurer  must  formalise  the  PCP  in  a  joint 
                            procurement agreement that: 
                                   specifies the working arrangements for the joint procurement (e.g. division 
                                    of tasks between the lead procurer and the buyers group; signature of the 
                                    subcontracts, etc.) 
                                   sets out the financial arrangements (e.g. the contributions of each member 
                                    of  the  buyers  group  to  the  common  jointly-committed  budget; 
                                    arrangements  for  financial  transfers  between  buyers  group  and/or  lead 
                                    procurer for carrying out the PCP)  
                                   specifies in-kind contributions provided by third parties 
                                   sets out other rights and obligations of the buyers group and lead procurer 
                                    (e.g. allocation of IPR-related rights resulting from the PCP; commitment to 
                                    provide test environments)

                               the procurement must be preceded by an open market consultation 
                                This open market consultation must be implemented as a ‘technical dialogue’ as 
                                                                                                                                  123

                                A  prior  information  notice  (PIN)  must  be  published  in  the  Official  Journal  of 
                                European  Union  (OJEU)  and  must  be  promoted  widely,  in  particular  via  the 
                                websites  specified  by  the  Commission/Agency  and  the  H2020  National  Contact 
                                Points (NCPs). 
                               the  procurement  must  be  based  on  common  procurement  specifications 
                                prepared by the buyers group and the lead procurer  
                                These specifications must be based on an analysis of the buyers group’s needs (i.e. 
                                the common challenge) and take into account the feedback from the open market 
                                consultation (meaning that it should be refined based on this feedback, if needed).  
                                They  must  describe  the  functionality  and  performance  requirements  (including 
                                minimum  requirements)  that  solutions  must  meet,  rather  than  prescribing  a 
                                specific solution. 
                               the buyers group and the lead procurer must publish a contract notice  to launch 
                                the request for tenders. 
                                The request for tenders does not have to be published. It can be provided on 
                                request. 
                               the buyers group and the lead procurer must jointly evaluate the tenders and 
                                make a joint award decision. 
             Beneficiaries have to demonstrate — upon request — that the selection of the subcontractors 
             complied with these rules.  
              
                    For more guidance and templates for the tender documents, see the PCP procurement documents [ODT 
                format]. 
                 
                 
             5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Minimum content of framework agreement 
                 and specific contracts  
             The beneficiaries must conclude a framework agreement (with each selected subcontractor) 
             which sets out the framework conditions for all 3 phases of the PCP implementation, including: 
                      the practical set-up of the implementation of the subcontracts, in particular: 
                               the number, duration and budget of the PCP phases 
                               the minimum number of expected subcontractors per PCP phase

                           the procedure for the intermediate evaluations after each PCP phase (in particular, 
                            the evaluation criteria and the weightings) 
                           the  process  for  monitoring  of  on-going  R&D  work  and  reporting  obligations  of 
                            subcontractors 
                           the procedures for accounting and payments 
                           an exclusion of contract renegotiations 
                           the  role  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  third  parties  involved  in  the 
                            implementation of the subcontracts 
                   the  minimum  requirements  that  subcontractors  must  comply  with  during  the  PCP 
                    implementation, in particular: 
                           compliance with the definition of R&D services (see General Annex E to the H2020 
                            Work Programme) 
                           the obligation of the subcontractors to ensure that the majority of the R&D work 
                            (including the work of the main researchers) is located in the EU Member States or 
                            H2020 associated countries (place of performance obligation) 
                           additional  national  requirements,  ethical  and/or  security  requirements  (if 
                            applicable) 
                   the arrangements for intellectual property rights, in particular: 
                           the  ownership,  by  the  subcontractors,  of  the  intellectual  property  rights  on  the 
                            results that they generate 
                           the right of the buyers to access to use the results — on a royalty-free basis — for 
                            their own internal use (see General Annex E to the H2020 Work Programme) 
                           the right of the buyers to grant (or to require the subcontractors to grant) non-
                            exclusive licences to third parties to exploit the results — under fair and reasonable 
                            conditions and without the right to sub-licence  
                           This right serves as a safeguard to ensure a competitive supply chain (during or 
                           after  the  PCP  action)  in  case  of  problems.  It  does  NOT  mean  that  every 
                           subcontractor  will  always  and  automatically  be  obliged  to  grant  non-exclusive 
                           licenses to third parties to exploit its results.  
                               Examples (licences needed): other providers working for the buyers group need access to 
                               the IPR to work for the buyers group; a PCP subcontractor abuses its monopoly situation  
                           the  obligation  of  the  subcontractors  to  transfer  results  (generated  by 
                            subcontractors  during  the  PCP  implementation)  to  the  buyers,  if  they  fail  to 
                            commercially  exploit  the  results  within  the  period  set  out  in  the  framework 
                            agreement or use the results to the detriment of the public  interest,  including 
                            security interests (see General Annex E to the H2020 Work Programme) 
                           This right serves as a safeguard to ensure commercial exploitation in the public 
                           interest,  in  case  the  subcontractors  fail  to  do  so  themselves.  It  will  be  for 
                           exceptional cases. 
                   the right of the buyers to publish: 
                           at the time of the contract award notice: the identity of the winning tenderers and 
                            a project summary provided by the winning tenderers  
                           after R&D has finished (and after consulting the subcontractors): summaries of the 
                            results as well as the identities of the subcontractors that successfully completed 
                            the last phase of the PCP 
                The framework agreement remains binding for as long as subcontractors remain in the PCP 
                (i.e. normally until the PCP subcontractor is no longer selected to continue for the next PCP 
                phase). 
            The beneficiaries must conclude specific contracts (with each selected subcontractor and for 
            each PCP phase) must set out the specific conditions applicable to each PCP phase, in particular: 
            PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1                                                        696

                           the details of the PCP R&D services purchased by each buyer 
                           quantity and 
                           price. 
                  The phase 1 specific contract is signed (together with the framework agreement) with all the 
                  subcontractors selected for phase 1. After phase 1 is finished, a call-off to award the phase 2 
                  specific contracts will be organised among the subcontractors who have successfully completed 
                  phase 1. After phase 2 is finished, a call-off to award at least two phase 3 contracts will be 
                  organised among the subcontractors who have successfully completed phase 2. 
              
             6. Additional cost eligibility condition: Compliance with the planning of resources 
             To ensure compliance with the resource planning (as set out in Annex 1), the beneficiaries must 
             ensure the timely  allocation  of  resources  in  order  to  implement  the  PCP  (including  allocating 
             sufficient time and resources for testing solutions in real-life operational end-user environments). 
                 Example: testing facilities or equipment to be provided by the buyers group (or other beneficiaries or third 
                 parties). 
              
             7. ‘Other obligation’: Compliance with national procurement rules 
                                                                                                     124

             apply  to  the  pre-commercial  procurement  of  R&D  services  (because  such  services  are 
                          125

             H2020 General MGA) must implement the PCP procurement in compliance with  provisions  in 
             national laws on public procurement that may be applicable to this type of R&D services 
             contracts.

              [OPTION 2 for PPI: Rules for procurement of the PPI innovative solution(s) 
              13.1.1 The beneficiaries will award subcontracts for procuring the ‘PPI innovative solution(s)’ that are 
              necessary to address the ‘common challenge’ set out in Annex 1. 
              The subcontracts must be awarded in one single joint (or several coordinated) procurement procedure(s) 
             by the beneficiaries concerned (i.e. the ‘buyers group’ and the ‘lead procurer’). 
              The  lead  procurer  must  be  a  ‘contracting  authority’  or  'contracting  entity'  as  defined  in    Directives 
              2004/18/EC (or 2014/24/EU) and, 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU). 
              The ‘buyers group’, the ‘lead procurer’, the innovative solution(s) and their estimated cost must be set out 
             in Annex 1. The estimated cost of PPI subcontracting per beneficiary must be set out in Annex 2. 
             
              [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
             only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 37).] 
              The beneficiaries concerned must — throughout the action —: 
                 -   guarantee  equal  treatment  of  tenderers  and  subcontractors  and  avoid  any  restrictions  or 
                     distortions of competition;   
                 -   avoid any conflict of interest (see Article 35); 
                 -   allow for all communications (with potential tenderers, tenderers and subcontractors) to be made 
                     in English (and any additional language(s) they may have chosen). 
              Participation in PPI tendering procedures must be open on equal terms to tenderers from EU Member 
              States, associated countries and other countries with which the EU has an agreement in the field of public 
              procurement. If the WTO Government Procurement Agreement applies, PPI subcontracts must also be 
              open to tenderers from States that have ratified this agreement. 
              The beneficiaries concerned must prepare, procure and implement the subcontracts in accordance with the 
             following requirements: 
                (a)  For the ‘preparation stage’: 
                   (i)    identify  and  agree (in writing) on their internal procedures for carrying out the joint (or 
                         coordinated) PPI procurement(s) (‘joint procurement agreement’); 
                   (ii)  [OPTION 1 for PPI actions that are not limited to the procurement of the limited set of 
                         prototypes and/or test products developed during a preceding PCP action: make an ‘open 
                         market consultation’ inviting all interested economic operators to participate, which 
                             -   is published — two months in advance —by the lead procurer in the Official Journal 
                                 of the European Union (via a ‘prior information notice (PIN)’, drawn up in English 
                                 and any additional language(s) chosen by the buyers group); 
                             -   is promoted and advertised widely; 
                             -   is  summarised  on  the  project  website  and  other  web-sites  requested  by  the 
                                 [Commission][Agency], together with a list of Q&As raised during the open market 
                                 consultation;]

                 test products developed during a preceding PCP action: 
                   (i)   Step 1: make one (or several)  ‘contract notice’(s), which: 
                            -   are  published  by  the  lead  procurer  (or  beneficiary)  in  the  Official  Journal  of  the 
                                European Union (in English and any additional language(s) chosen by the buyers 
                                group); 
                            -   specify  a  time-limit  for  receipt  of  tenders  that  is  sufficient  for  the  preparation  of 
                                innovative bids. 
                                The call(s) for tender must remain open for at least 60 days. 
                                The restricted procedure with shortened time-limit for receipt of tenders may not be 
                                used; 
                            -   allow for the submission of tenders in English (and any additional language(s) chosen 
                                by the buyers group); 
                            -   are promoted and advertised widely; 
                            -   indicate how potential tenderers can obtain the tender documentation and the ‘PPI 
                                request(s) for tenders’;

                  (ii)   Step 2: make one (or several) evaluation(s) of the tenders, ranking them, on the basis of the 
                         common tender specifications (see above), according to best value for money criteria and 
                         ensuring that the price corresponds to market conditions; 
                  (iii)  Step 3: award the subcontract(s) to the tenderer(s) offering best value for money and a price 
                         corresponding to market conditions; 
                  (iv)   Step  4:  make  one  (or  several)  ‘contract  award  notice’(s),  which  are  published  by  the 
                         beneficiary or lead procurer in the Official Journal of the European Union (in English and

                            (iii)   ensure payment of the subcontractors. 
                The  beneficiaries  concerned  must  ensure  that  [the  Agency,]  the  Commission,  the  European  Court  of 
                Auditors (ECA) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and

                13.1.2 In addition, the beneficiaries concerned must ensure that their obligations under Articles 17.1 18, 34, 
                35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 46 also apply to the subcontractors. 
                Beneficiaries  acting  as  contracting  authorities  within  the  meaning  of  Directive  2004/18/EC  (or 
                2014/24/EU) or as contracting entities within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU) must 
                comply with the applicable national law on public procurement.

              1. PPI subcontracting 
              For PPI actions, beneficiaries award PPI subcontracts for procuring the innovative solutions that 
              are necessary to address the common challenge set out in Annex 1 (PPI innovative solution(s)). 
              ‘PPI  subcontract’  thus  means  a contract for the purchase of innovative solutions (identified in 
              Annex 1 as an action task). 
              The requirements for PPI subcontracting are generally similar as for PCP subcontracting.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                     PCP/PPI MGA 
            However, PPI subcontracting has the following specificities: 
            The PPI procurement covers 2 phases (deployment and operational validation) — but there is no 
            requirement to split the PPI procurement for those 2 phases in different contracts. 
            The  beneficiaries  may  choose  between  implementing  one  single  or  several  coordinated  PPI 
            procurements.  
                    For joint procurements, there is one joint PPI call for tender launched by the lead procurer 
                    and one joint evaluation of offers.  
                    For coordinated procurements, there are several separate PPI procurements carried out 
                    individually by the different procurers in the buyers group.   
            Moreover, the buyers group may select one or more subcontractors.  
            The common challenge does NOT concern R&D services, but the supply of innovative goods or 
            services. The buyers group acts as a launch customer (early adopter) of innovative solutions that 
            are not yet available on a large-scale commercial basis. 
                PPI cannot include the procurement of R&D. Only procurement procedures that do not involve 
                the procurement of R&D can be used for PPI (e.g. innovation partnership procedure).  
                Each PPI action focuses on one concrete common challenge and requires innovative solutions 
                that are to a significant extent similar across countries, making it sensible to procure them 
                together (i.e. the core functionality and performance characteristics must be the same; there 
                may  be  additional  local  functionalities  —  due  to  differences  in  the  local  context  of  each 
                individual procurer). 
            Also, there is a common budget for the procurement (common jointly-committed budget) only 
            if  the buyers group would like to centralise payments. Each buyer may alternatively manage a 
            separate budget for the innovative solutions it buys. 
            Finally,  the  subcontracts  are  not  necessarily  signed  by  the  lead  procurer;  there  is  not 
            necessarily a framework agreement. 
                The buyers group may choose between direct subcontracts or a framework agreement with 
                specific contracts (with each selected subcontractor). 
                For joint procurements: 
                   the buyers group may mandate the lead procurer — in the joint procurement agreement — 
                   to sign the framework agreements and/or the specific contracts/direct subcontracts 
                   if there is no mandate, the general rule is that:  
                       framework agreement(s) must be signed by all members of the buyers group together  
                       specific  contracts  must  be  signed  by  each  buyer  individually  (for  the  innovative 
                        solution(s) it buys). 
            PPI subcontracting is not restricted to a limited part of the action (since the PPI subcontracting is 
            the main goal of PPI actions). 
             
                   Article 13.1 contains both additional cost eligibility conditions (in Article 13.1.1) and ‘other obligations’ (in 
              Article 13.1.2).  
               
                 .

             2.  Additional  cost  eligibility  condition:  Procurers,  tasks  and  costs  set  out  in 
                 Annexes 1 and 2 — No simplified approval procedure 
             Annexes 1 and 2 must clearly identify the common challenge (type of innovative solutions to be 
             procured), the lead procurer, the buyers group, and the estimated costs per beneficiary, already 
             at the moment of the signature of the GA. Any changes at a later stage (e.g. after the preparation 
             stage of the project) are only possible through an amendment; see Article 55).  
             At the end of the preparation stage of the project, the consortium must confirm (in the periodic 
             report;  see  Article  20.3)  that  lead  procurer  has  not  changed  and  that  the  buyers  group’s 
             commitments to the budget for carrying out the PPI are still valid — or whether changes are 
             needed, based on the feedback of the preparation stage of the project (e.g. the open market 
             consultation). 
             For PPI subcontracting, there is NO simplified approval procedure (contrary to the subcontracting 
             of related additional coordination and networking activities; see Article 13.2). 
              
             3. Additional cost eligibility condition: Procurement procedure — Best value for 
                 money — Price corresponding to market conditions 
             Like for PCP subcontracts: 
                     the beneficiaries must base the PPI subcontracts on the best price-quality ratio  
                     the price must correspond to market conditions  
                   AND 
                     a specific procurement procedure must be followed. 
                       The main elements of this procedure are as follows: 
                               the  buyers  group  and  lead  procurer  must  formalise  the  PPI  in  a  joint 
                                procurement agreement that: 
                                        specifies the working arrangements (e.g. division of tasks between the lead 
                                         procurer  and  the  buyers  group;  use  of  a  framework  agreement  or  not; 
                                         signature of subcontracts, etc.) 
                                        sets  out  the  financial  arrangements  (e.g.  budget  for  the  procurement 
                                         committed per member of the buyers group; arrangements for financial 
                                         transfers — if any — between members of the buyers group and/or lead 
                                         procurer for carrying out the PPI)  
                                        specifies in-kind contributions provided by linked third parties  
                                        sets out other rights and obligations of the buyers group and lead procurer 
                                         (e.g. IPR-related rights, commitments to provide test environments)  
                               the procurement must normally be preceded by an open market consultation (— 
                                unless the PPI is limited to procuring a limited set of prototypes or test products 
                                resulting from a previous PCP action carried out by the same procurers). 
                                The open market consultation must be implemented as a ‘technical dialogue’ as 
                                                                                                                                127

                                        This date must give potential tenderers sufficient time to adapt their 
                                        production  chain  to  reach  the  required  functionality  or  performance

                                       whether verification of the market’s readiness to deliver the requested 
                                        quality/price  (e.g.  via  conformance  testing,  certification  or  quality

                                        at what point in the process.  
                           the buyers group and the lead procurer must prepare ‘common procurement 
                            specifications  
                            The specifications must be based on an analysis of the buyers group’s needs (i.e. 
                            the common challenge) and — if there was an open market consultation — take 
                            into account the feedback from that consultation. 
                            They must describe the functionality and performance requirements that solutions 
                            must meet, rather than prescribing a specific solution. 
                           the buyers group and the lead procurer must publish a contract notice to launch 
                            the request for tenders  (— unless the PPI is limited to procuring a limited set of 
                            prototypes or test products resulting from a previous PCP action carried out by the 
                            same procurers) 
                            The request for tenders should specify the arrangements for intellectual property 
                            rights (see below) and the buyers’ right to publish summaries of the results and 
                            the subcontractors’ identities. 
                            The request for tenders does not have to be published. It can be provided on 
                            request.

            4. Additional cost eligibility condition: Minimum content of subcontracts 
            The beneficiaries must conclude subcontract(s) that specify: 
                   the practical set-up of the implementation of the subcontracts, in particular: 
                           the  process  for  monitoring  of  on-going  work  and  reporting  obligations  of 
                            subcontractors 
                           the role and the rights and obligations of third parties involved in the PPI 
                           the procedures for accounting and payments 
                           an exclusion of contract renegotiations 
                   the  minimum  requirements  that  subcontractors  must  comply  with  during  the  PPI 
                    implementation, in particular: 
                           implementation of the innovative solutions in accordance with the objectives of the 
                            action 
                           additional  national  requirements,  ethical  and/or  security  requirements  (if 
                            applicable) 
                   the arrangements for intellectual property rights (IPRs), in particular: 
                           the ownership by the subcontractor(s) of the intellectual property rights on the 
                            results  they  generate  —  except  in  duly  justified  cases  (e.g.  if  the  party  that 
                            produced the results is not able to exploit them) 
                        The intellectual property provisions described here are the minimum requirements that 
                        must be respected. Beneficiaries may — if appropriate — specify additional intellectual 
                        property provisions (e.g. regarding access to background, licensing etc.) if these: 
                                   do not conflict with their obligations under other Articles and  
                                   maximise the incentives for both beneficiaries and subcontractors to use, 
                                    widely exploit and commercialise the results 
                   the right of the buyers to publish: 
                           at the time of the contract award notice: the identity of the winning tenderer(s) 
                            and a project summary provided by the winning tenderer(s) 
                           after the contract(s) has(have) finished (and after consulting the subcontractor(s)): 
                            summaries of the results as well as the identities of the subcontractor(s) 
                   the specific conditions for each buyer, in particular: 
                           details of the innovative solutions purchased by each buyer 
                           quantity and 
            PCP/PPI > Chapter 4 > Section 1 > Article 13.1                                                        704

                               price. 
             If  the  beneficiaries  choose  a  framework  agreement  with  specific  contracts  (for  the  innovative 
             solutions procured by each buyer), the specific conditions for each buyer must be in the specific 
             contracts (and the rest in the framework agreement). 
              
             5. Additional cost eligibility condition: Compliance with the planning of resources 
             To ensure compliance with the resource planning (as set out in Annex 1), the beneficiaries must 
             ensure  the  timely  allocation  of  resources  in  order  to  implement  the  PPI  (including  allocating 
             sufficient time and resources for testing solutions in real-life operational end-user environments). 
                 Example: testing facilities or equipment to be provided by the buyers group (or other beneficiaries or third 
                 parties). 
              
             6. ‘Other obligation’: Compliance with national procurement rules 
                                                                                                                               128
             Contrary  to  PCP,  the  EU  public  procurement  Directives  2014/24/EU,  2014/25/EU                                    and 
             2009/81/EC  normally apply to PPI procurements. 
             Therefore, the beneficiaries that are ‘contracting authorities’ or ‘contracting entities’ (within the 
                                                                                129

             —  like  in  the  General  MGA  —  also  comply  with  the  applicable  national  law  on  public 
             procurement.

                           13.2 Rules for subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities 
                          
                            13.2.1  If  necessary  to  implement  the  action,  the  beneficiaries  may  award  subcontracts  for  the  ‘related 
                           additional coordination and networking activities’ described in Annex 1. 
                           The beneficiaries must award the subcontracts ensuring the best value for money or, if appropriate, the 
                            lowest price. In doing so, they must avoid any conflict of interests (see Article 35). 
                           [OPTION: In addition, if the value of the subcontract to be awarded exceeds EUR […], the beneficiaries 
                                                                                                                     28
                           must comply with the following rules: […]. ] 
                           The tasks to be implemented and the estimated cost for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1 and the 
                           total  estimated  costs  of  subcontracting  per  beneficiary  must  be  set  out  in  Annex  2.  The 
                            [Commission][Agency]  may  however  approve  subcontracts  not  set  out  in  Annex  1  and  2  without 
                           amendment according to Article 55, if: 
                                     -        they are specifically justified in the periodic or final technical report, and 
                                     -        they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
                                              the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                           [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
                           only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 37).] 
                           The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
                           their subcontractors. 
                           13.2.2 In addition, the beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38, and 46 also 
                           apply to the subcontractors. 
                           Beneficiaries  acting  as  contracting  authorities  within  the  meaning  of  Directive  2004/18/EC  (or 
                            2014/24//EU) or as contracting entities within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU) must 
                           comply with the applicable national law on public procurement. 
                           13.3               Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If  a  beneficiary  breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.1 or 13.2.1, the costs related to the 
                            subcontract concerned will be ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under Article 13.1.2 or 13.2.2, the grant may be reduced (see 
                           Article 43). 
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                            28
                                   If the authorising officer decides to set specific rules, they should have due regard for the principle of proportionality taking into account 
                                   the value of the contracts and the relative size of the EU contributions in relation to the total cost of the action and the risk. Specific rules 
                                   must be based on the rules contained in the Financial Regulation. Simply citing the FR without specifying the applicable provisions 
                                   should be avoided. Specific rules may only be set for the award of contracts of a value higher than EUR 60 000. The authorising officer 
                                   may set a threshold higher than EUR 60 000 on the basis of a risk assessment.  
                             
                          
                                            
                         1. Subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities 
                         For the subcontracting of related additional coordination and networking activities, the same rules 
                         apply as in the General MGA (see Article 13 H2020 General MGA).

                          What & When? For PCP/PPI  actions, the coordinator must submit a periodic report after the end 
                          of each reporting period (including the final one). 
                          Before the end of the action, these are only technical reports, with information on the technical 
                          implementation. 
                                   List of documents for the technical reports: 
                                                    explanation of the work carried out 
                                                    overview of the progress

                       summary for publication 
                       questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested) 
                       call for tender documents (including contract notice, invitation to tender and procurement 
                        contracts) 
                       report on outcome of the preparation phase (e.g. open market consultation) 
                       commitment on availability of funds (Annex 7)  
                        This ensures that the PCP/PPI subcontracting costs are covered. 
                       statement on the use of the previous pre-financing instalment (Annex 8) 
            NO financial reporting during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final report). The 
            coordinator only has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing 
            instalment (which includes also the request for further pre-financing payments; only the first pre-
            financing payment is automatic; see Annex 7) 
            How? Each periodic report must be prepared by the coordinator and the other beneficiaries 
            together, directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal). 
             
            2. Reporting periods 
            Normally, PCP/PPI actions are divided into 2 reporting periods (with 2 pre-financing payments; see 
            Article 21). The first reporting period corresponds to the preparation of the joint procurement; the 
            second  reporting  period  corresponds  to  the  implementation  and  follow-up  of  the  joint 
            procurement.  
            Actions will exceptionally be divided into 3 reporting periods (with 3 pre-financing payments), if 
            the Commission/Agency does not have sufficient payment credits to pay the entire amount as a 
            second pre-financing payment.  
            The first (and, if there are 2 pre-financing payments, also the second) reporting period triggers a 
            periodic report.

                           The following payments will be made to the coordinator: 
                                     -        a first pre-financing payment; 
                                     -        a second pre-financing payment, on the basis of the request for a second pre-financing payment

                                     -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 20) 
                          
                           21.2 Pre-financing payments — Amount — Amount retained for the Guarantee Fund 
                           The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float. 
                           It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
                            Article 58) or from 10 days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest — 
                           make a first pre-financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], 
                            except if Article 48 applies. 
                           From this amount, an amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 5 % of 
                           the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the [Commission][Agency] and transferred into 
                            the ‘Guarantee Fund’. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will — within 60 days after receiving the request (see Article 20) — make a 
                           second pre-financing payment to the coordinator of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)] except 
                           if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                           [OPTION in case of three pre-financing payments: The [Commission][Agency] will — within 60 days 
                            after receiving the request (see Article 20) — make a third pre-financing payment to the coordinator of EUR 
                           [insert amount (insert amount in words)], except if Articles 47 or 48 apply.] 
                           If the statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment shows that less than 70 % of the previous 
                            payment has been used to cover the costs of the action, the amount of the new pre-financing to be paid will 
                           be reduced by the difference between the 70 % threshold and the amount used.

              For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount. 
              In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the

            1. Payments to be made — No interim payments 
            Normally, PCP/PPI  actions are divided into 2 reporting periods (see Article 20.2) with 2 pre-
            financing payments (— unless the action is exceptionally divided into 3 reporting periods with 3 
            pre-financing payments because of insufficient payment credits). 
            There are NO interim payments, but the second pre-financing payment (after the end of the first 
            reporting period, i.e. after the evaluation of the preparation stage of the PCP/PPI procurement) 
            provides beneficiaries with the necessary funds to launch the PCP/PPI procurement.  
                The second (or third) pre-financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requested by the 
                coordinator via a statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment (see Article 20). 
                In  this  statement,  the  beneficiaries  must  simply  declare  how  much  of  the  previous  pre-
                financing was used up, not how much costs were incurred (since PCP/PPI pre-financing is NOT 
                linked to financial reporting). 
            The balance is paid when the action ends (after the submission of financial reports). 
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries? 
            Pre-financing payment 
            How much? Typically (and depending on the availability of EU budget credits), the amounts of 
            the pre-financing payments for PCP/PPI actions are as follows: 
                   for  the  first  pre-financing  payment:  the  percentage  of  the  maximum  grant  amount 
                    foreseen for the additional networking and coordination activities related to the preparation 
                    of the call for tender 
                   for the second pre-financing payment: if needed, up to 100% of the remaining part of the 
                    grant  (minus the amount of the first pre-financing payment). 
                If the GA provides for a third pre-financing payment, the amounts will be adapted.

                 previous pre-financing instalment — the previous pre-financing was not fully used: 
                        if 70% or more of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing is 
                         paid in full 
                        if less than 70% of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing 
                         will be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 
                         70%.

                           22.1               Checks, reviews and audits by the [the Agency and the] Commission  
                           […] 
                           22.1.2                Right to carry out reviews  
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may — during the implementation of the action or afterwards — carry out 
                            reviews on the proper implementation of the action (including assessment of deliverables and reports), 
                           compliance with the obligations under the Agreement and continued scientific or technological relevance of 
                           the action.  
                           Reviews may be started up to two years after the payment of the balance. They will be formally notified 
                            to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned and will be considered to have started on the date of the formal 
                           notification. 
                           If the review is carried out on a third party (see Articles 10 to 16), the beneficiary concerned must inform 
                            the third party.  
                           The [Agency or the] Commission may carry out reviews directly (using its own staff) or indirectly (using 
                           external persons or bodies appointed to do so). It will inform the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the 
                            identity of the external persons or bodies. They have the right to object to the appointment on grounds of 
                           commercial confidentiality.  
                           The coordinator or beneficiary concerned must provide — within the deadline requested — any information 
                           and data in addition to deliverables and reports already submitted (including information on the use of 
                            resources). The [Agency or the] Commission may request beneficiaries to provide such information to it 
                           directly. 
                           The  coordinator  or  beneficiary  concerned  may  be  requested  to  participate  in  meetings,  including  with 
                            external experts.  
                           For  on-the-spot  reviews,  the  beneficiaries  must  allow  access  to  their  sites  and  premises,  including  to 
                           external persons or bodies, and must ensure that information requested is readily available. 
                           Information  provided  must  be  accurate,  precise  and  complete  and  in  the  format  requested,  including 
                            electronic format. 
                           On the basis of the review findings, a ‘review report’ will be drawn up.  
                          
                            The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the review report to the coordinator or beneficiary 
                           concerned, which has 30 days to formally notify observations (‘contradictory review procedure’).  
                           Reviews (including review reports) are in the language of the Agreement. 
                           […] 
                                            
                         1. Technical reviews 
                         For PCP/PPI  actions, the Commission/Agency may in particular carry out technical reviews at key 
                         milestone points during the action (e.g. for PCP actions, at the transition from one PCP phase to 
                         the next).

                         VII.1 Background information and approach 
                         The EJP Cofund Model Grant Agreement is used for European Joint Programme Cofund actions 
                         only. 
                         The EJP Cofund MGA follows the General MGA for numbering and content, except for the following:  
                          
                                                 The H2020 EJP Cofund MGA deviates from the General MGA as follows: 
                                                                 Article 3 (duration of EJP Cofund actions: 60 months)                                                                        
                                                                 Article 5.2 (EJP Cofund specific reimbursement rate)

                                                                 Article 19 (EJP Cofund specific deliverables)                                                                                                  
                                                                 Article 20.2, 20.2a, 20.3 (EJP Cofund specific reporting provisions)                                                                           
                                                                 Article 21.1, 21.2, 21.5 (EJP Cofund specific payment provisions)  
                                                                 Annex 7                             Annual work plan for the next year                                                                         
                                                                 Annex 8                             Model for the statement on the use of the previous pre-
                                                                                                      financing payment 
                          
                         The  annotations  will  concentrate  on  differences  in  substance  and  interpretation  that  require 
                         explanation.  
                                  Parts that differ only in presentation (e.g. Article 16, Annexes) will not be shown. 
                                  By contrast, provisions that do not deviate from the General MGA, but that require clarification 
                                  or a specific interpretation for EJP Cofund actions are added:  
                                                  Article 2 (EJP Cofund actions) 
                                                  Article 4.1 (EJP Cofund budget categories) 
                                                  Article 6 (EJP Cofund eligible and ineligible costs) 
                                                  Article 6.2.D.2 and F (Euratom Fusion EJP Cofund action durable equipment option and 
                                                   specific categories of costs) 
                                                  Article 8 (EJP Cofund rules on third party involvement).

                         What? EJP Cofund funds: 
                                          a  joint  programme  of  activities  by  coordinated  national  research  and  innovation 
                                           programmes (— ranging from research and innovation to coordination and networking 
                                           activities and including training, dissemination and financial support to third parties).  
                         EJP does NOT fund individual projects or coordination networks. 
                         Normally,  EJP  Cofund  grants  are  multi-beneficiary  grants;  exceptionally  they  can  be  mono-
                         beneficiary grants for ‘sole participants’ (see General Annex D to the H2020 Work Programme). 
                         EJP Cofund actions are funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020 and the Euratom Research and Training 
                         Programme (e.g. NFRP7–2015; Fusion programme Cofund action (FEJP) in section B.1 Euratom 
                         Work Programme 2014-2015).

                         For EJP Cofund actions, the action duration is normally 60 months.  
                                  If implementation of the action is justifiably delayed, the consortium may request an extension 
                                  (i.e. request an amendment extending the action duration; see Article 55). The duration can 
                                  however NOT exceed 84 months.

                           4.1                Estimated budget 
                           The ‘estimated budget’ for the action is set out in Annex 2. 
                           It contains the estimated eligible costs and the forms of costs, broken down by beneficiary [(and linked third 
                           party)] and  budget category (see Articles 5, 6, [and 14]). [OPTION to be used if Article 9 or 14a applies:

                         1. Budget categories 
                         The EJP Cofund MGA uses the same budget categories as the General MGA. 
                                  Budget categories of the EJP Cofund MGA: 
                                                  direct personnel costs 
                                                                    costs for employees (or equivalent) 
                                                                    costs for natural persons working under a direct contract 
                                                                    costs of personnel seconded by a third party against payment 
                                                                    costs for SME owners without salary 
                                                                    costs for beneficiaries that are natural persons without salary 
                                                  direct costs of subcontracting 
                                                  direct costs of providing financial support to third parties (if option applies) 
                                                  other direct costs 
                                                                    travel costs and related subsistence allowances 
                                                                    equipment costs 
                                                                    costs of other goods and services 
                                                                    capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure 
                                                  indirect costs 
                                                  specific categories of costs (if option applies).  
                                          For the FEJP action, there are moreover 3 additional specific cost categories: 
                                                                    costs for mobility of personnel  
                                                                    costs for fellowships for researchers 
                                                                    access costs for research infrastructure. 
                                   Thus, the EJP Cofund MGA does NOT have: 
                                                     personnel costs for providing trans-national access to research infrastructure. 
                                  The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                           5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).

                     2. Cost forms  
                     For EJP Cofund actions, the cost forms are in principle the same as in the General MGA (i.e. 
                     actual costs, unit costs and flat rate costs; see Article 5 H2020 General MGA). 
                     For  the  FEJP  action,  there  are  however  3  specific  unit  costs  for  category  F  ‘specific  cost 
                     categories’: 
                                           costs  for  mobility  of  personnel:  daily  subsistence  allowance,  monthly  subsistence 
                                            allowance and monthly family allowance 
                                           costs for fellowships for researchers: monthly living allowance, mobility allowance and 
                                            family allowance 
                                                                                                                            131
                                           access costs for research infrastructure.

                            ‘Indirect costs’ are costs that are not directly linked to the action implementation and therefore cannot be 
                           attributed directly to it. 
                           […] 
                            
                            16       Insert precise name of the costs (as in the Commission decision authorising the use of the unit cost/  lump-sum). For example: ‘access 
                                     costs for providing trans-national access to research infrastructure’; ‘costs for clinical studies’; ‘costs for energy efficiency measures in 
                                     buildings’, ‘costs for mobility of personnel’, ‘costs for fellowships for researchers’, ‘access costs for research infrastructure’. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Specific conditions for costs to be eligible 
                         Article 6.2 refers to specific eligibility conditions, applicable per budget category. 
                         The EJP Cofund MGA uses in principle the same budget categories (covering the same types of 
                         costs) as the General MGA and the same eligibility conditions and calculation rules apply 
                         (see Article 6 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, EJP grants have the following specificities: 
                                     for category A ‘personnel costs’ 
                                           Costs of students, PhDs and other researchers (under scholarship, internship or 
                                           similar agreement) — Are eligible even if the agreement is training-oriented (or work-
                                           oriented  but  with  a  non-negligeable  training  component),  the  costs  fulfil  the  eligibility 
                                           conditions set out in Article 6 and Annex 1 explicitly includes the training activities. 
                                     for category D.2 ‘equipment costs’ 
                                           There is a special cost category for the FEJP action: full purchase cost for JET equipment 
                                           (see below).

               Calculation 
            This budget category applies to all EJP grants. 
            An additional option for full purchase costs for equipment for JET facilities will be inserted into the 
            GA for the Fusion programme EJP Cofund action (FEJP). 
            As in the General MGA, the beneficiaries may normally declare the following types of equipment 
            costs under category D.2 ‘equipment costs’ (see Article 6.2.D.2 H2020 General MGA):  
                one of the following:  
                   −   either depreciation costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets  
                   −   or purchase costs of equipment, infrastructure or other assets (if option applies)  
                AND: 
                   −   costs of renting or leasing of equipment, infrastructure or other assets  
                   −   costs  of  equipment,  infrastructure  or  other  assets  contributed  in-kind  against 
                       payment. 
            1.1 Equipment costs: Cost of purchasing equipment, infrastructure or other assets to be 
                included in the JET facilities 
            1.1.1 What? This budget category covers the full purchase costs of equipment, infrastructure or 
            other  assets  to  be  included  in  JET  facilities  (not  only  the  depreciation  costs  for  the  relevant 
            periodic report). 
            1.1.2 Equipment costs must be declared as actual costs (see Article 5.2(d)). 
            1.1.3 The costs must comply with the following eligibility conditions:  
                       fulfil the general conditions for actual costs to be eligible (i.e. incurred during the 
                        action duration, necessary, linked to the action, recorded in the beneficiary’s accounts, 
                        etc.; see Article 6.1(a))  
                       concern equipment, infrastructure or other assets (new or second-hand) to be included 
                        in JET facilities 
                        ‘JET’  means  Joint  European  Torus,  i.e.  the  experimental  device  for  studying  fusion 
                        relevant plasmas in operation at Culham, UK.  
                        ‘JET facilities’ include, in particular, the JET device and auxiliary facilities (such as the

             direct costs for the mobility (e.g. extra costs incurred for the activities of the seconded persons) or 
             direct costs for managing the mobility. Such costs can be declared under another budget category

                  The European Commission may update these unit costs if the joint index based on inflation in 
                  Belgium and Luxembourg deviates from the 2014 baseline inflation index by 10 % or more. In 
                  this case, the FEJP GA will be amended (and the Annotated MGA will be revised accordingly). 
             As mentioned above, mobility costs for personnel contributed in-kind against payment must be 
             declared as actual costs (of the beneficiary) under another budget category (i.e. category D.1 
             ‘travel’; see Article 6.2.D.1).  
                  Best practice: Beneficiaries and third parties should use the rates fixed by Decision C(2013) 8201 
                  for the mobility cost to be reimbursed to the third party and to pay this amount to the personnel 
                  (see Article 11.1).

                          have been fully incurred for the benefit of the seconded personnel (i.e. fully paid 
                           to the individuals, including during annual leave, special leave, sick leave and holidays) 
                          for  the  family  allowance:  be  incurred  for  personnel  accompanied  during  the 
                           secondment by dependent children (between 5 and 18 years), enrolled in regular full-
                           time attendance at a primary or secondary school that charges tuition fees (registration 
                           and attendance fees). 
             1.1.4 They must be calculated as follows: 
                     for the daily subsistence allowance: 
                       amount per unit (≈ EUR 127,65  x  country coeff. corr.)  x  number of actual days of secondment 
                       ‘Day of secondment’ means each day of secondment that lasts more than 12 hours and 
                      is calculated as follows:

                               the base amount is the time between the departure time and the return time 
                                of the main form of transport used for the secondment  
                               to this amount, add the following for each leg of the journey (outward and 
                                return):  
                                       for train travel: a maximum of 30 minutes for each leg  
                                       for air travel: a maximum of 2 hours for each leg.  
                                NO extra time is added if the journey is by any means of transport other than 
                                train or plane. 
                          Example: 
                          The seconded person leaves her/his normal place of employment on a flight departing at 9:35 on 
                          Monday 3 April and returns on a flight that arrives at 10:35 on Wednesday 5 April. 
                          This amounts to 3 days of secondment: Wednesday 5 April is also counted as exceeding 12 hours 
                          (00:00 until the flight arrival time of 10:35, plus 2 hours extra time = 12 hours 35 minutes).  
                  for the monthly subsistence allowance: 
                    amount per unit (see table above  x  count. coef. corr.)  x  number of actual months of secondment 
                  for the family allowance: 
                    amount per unit (EUR 252,81)  x  number of actual months of secondment  x  number of dependent 
                   children 
                    The family allowance is paid for each full month of secondment in which the dependent 
                   child is between 5 and 18 years. 
                   ‘Month of secondment’ means each full month of secondment (NO pro-rata payments for 
                   partial months of secondment).  
                       A full month can be one of the following two: 
                               a calendar month (e.g. 1 to 31 July inclusive) or  
                              a  month  from  the  date  the  secondment  starts  until  the  same  date  the 
                               following month (excluding the last day, e.g. 3 July to 2 August). 
                            If a secondment starts on 31 January (or on 30 or 31 January in a leap year), it is 
                            considered to have been completed at midnight on 28 February (since there is 
                            never a 30 February and a 29 February only in leap years).  
             
            Examples for calculating unit costs for mobility of personnel: 
            1. An employee with primary employment in Rome is seconded to the joint programme unit in Garching (Munich), 
            Germany, from 1 January 2015 to 31 August 2016 (20 months). He is accompanied by one 6-year-old child, who is 
            enrolled in a fee-paying primary school. 
            Daily subsistence allowance: 609 days * EUR 127,65 = EUR 77 738,85 
            Monthly subsistence allowance: 20 months * EUR 382,92 (800< distance >1 300) = EUR 7 658,40 
            Subtotal = EUR 85 697,25 
            * correction coefficient (2016) of 106.0 % (Germany Munich) = EUR 90 839,09 
            Family allowance: 20 months * EUR 252,81 = EUR 5 056,20 
            Total declared unit costs: EUR 95 895,29 
            2. An employee with primary employment in Madrid is sent to a scientific project meeting at Culham, UK, for three 
            days.  
            Daily subsistence allowance: 3 days * EUR 127,65 = EUR 382,95 
            * correction coefficient (2016) of 127,7 % (Culham, UK) = EUR 489,03 
            Total declared unit costs: EUR 489,03

             1.2 Specific cost category – costs for fellowships for researchers (F.2) 
             1.2.1  What?  This  budget  category  covers  direct  costs  for  FEJP  researcher  fellowships,  by 
             providing for  
                      a monthly living allowance, with full social security coverage and unit costs (including all 
                       compulsory deductions) in accordance with applicable national legislation (gross amount)  
                      a  monthly  mobility  allowance  to  cover  additional  costs,  e.g. relating  to  travel  and 
                       accommodation and  
                      a monthly family allowance to reduce family-related obstacles to researcher mobility. 
              
                          The unit cost for fellowships for researchers was applicable ONLY until 31 December 2018. It has been 
                      discontinued since then. 
                       
                          . 
             What not? This budget category does not cover direct costs for managing the fellowships. Such 
             costs  can  be  declared  under  another  budget  category  (i.e.  category  D.3  ‘other  goods  and 
                           
             services’; see Article 6.2.D.3). 
                       
             It also does not cover indirect costs for managing the fellowships. Such costs can be declared 
                       
             under another budget category (i.e. category E ‘indirect costs’; see Article 6.2.E). 
                                                                                                                        138
             1.2.2 The costs must be declared as the unit costs fixed by Decision C(2013) 8201                              and set out 
             in Annexes 2 and 2a of the GA.

                         for the living allowance: EUR 3 110 for early-stage researchers and EUR 4 650 for 
                           experienced researchers, per fellow per month  
                           This amount is subject to a ‘country-specific correction coefficient’ (based on the seven-

             Example for calculating unit costs for researchers fellowships: 
             A Belgian early-stage researcher with no family is starting a fellowship in Finland for 18 months as part of a PhD 
             programme. 
             Living allowance: 18 months * EUR 3 110 = EUR 55 980 
             * correction coefficient of 116.6 % (Finland) = EUR 65 272.68 
             Mobility allowance: 18 months * EUR 600 = EUR 10 800 
             No family allowance 
             Total declared unit costs: EUR 76 072.68 
              
             1.3 Specific cost category – access costs for research infrastructure (F.2)  
             1.3.1 What? This budget category covers direct and indirect access costs for providing FEJP 
             access to research infrastructure (i.e. equipment and running costs of the installation and the 
             costs for logistical, technological and scientific support to users’ access, including costs for ad-hoc 
             training needed by users to use the installation and for preparatory and closing activities needed 
             to work on the installation). 
                           This  specific  budget  category  must  be  distinguished  from  the  general  budget  category  D.4 
                       'capitalised  and  operating  costs  of  large  research  infrastructure'  (see  Article  6.2.D.4  H2020 
                       General MGA). FEJP beneficiaries that that have obtained a positive ex-ante assessment may opt between 
                       declaring costs under: 
                               category D.4 ‘capitalised and operating costs of large research infrastructure’ 
                            or 
                               category F.2 ‘access cost for research infrastructure’. 
              
             It may also be used for access to infrastructure provided by a third party free of charge. 
             It may NOT be used for infrastructure contributed in-kind against payment (see below). 
             What not? Travel and subsistence costs for users to get access are not included in the access 
             costs.  (These  costs  can  be  reimbursed  separately,  under  category  D.1  ‘travel’;  see  Article 
             6.2.D.1).  
             1.3.2 If they are declared under this budget category, these costs must be declared as the unit 
                                                                                       141
             cost calculated in accordance with Decision C(2013) 8201                      and set out in Annexes 2 and 2a of 
             the GA. 
                 The precise unit cost is not pre-fixed by the Decision; it must be established for each access 
                 provider and installation — before signature of the FEJP GA.  
                     The ‘unit of access’ to the installation must be identified (i.e. the unit used to measure the 
                     total quantity of access that the installation provides to its users) 
                     The ‘amount per unit of access’ (EUR/unit of access) must be calculated according to the 
                     following formula: 
                                                                                                                       142
                              Amount per unit       =         average annual total access cost (over past two years      ) 
                                                                                                                          143
                                                           average annual total quantity of access (over past two years      ) 
                              The averages must be based on: 
                                       the beneficiary’s certified or auditable historical data 
                                       costs  allocated  to  the  installation  according  to  the  beneficiary’s  usual  cost  accounting

                                  undergoing long-term maintenance). 
                          ‘Total quantity of access’ means the units of access annually provided by the installation for the 
                          purposes of the activities referred to in Annex 1 of the GA (for the reference period years N-1 and N-
                          2). 
                          ‘Total access costs’ is calculated on the basis of the following categories of eligible costs: 
                                   direct costs incurred by the access provider for the ‘annual total quantity of access to the 
                                    installation’,  as  recorded  in  the  certified  or  auditable  profit-and-loss  accounts  of  the 
                                    reference period (years N-1 and N-2) for: 
                                       personnel costs of administrative, technical and scientific staff directly assigned to 
                                         keep the installation functioning normally and to support the users 
                                       costs of contracts for maintenance and repair (including specific cleaning, calibrating

                                       costs of consumables specifically used for the installation and the users’ research 
                                         work 
                                       costs of contracts for installation management, including security fees, insurance

                                    costs, minus any costs of subcontracting (i.e. costs of contracts for maintenance and 
                                    repair, installation management, scientific services and other electronic services)

            The unit cost can be changed only via an amendment to the agreement (see Article 55). 
            As already mentioned above, access costs for installations contributed in-kind must be declared as 
            actual costs under another budget category (i.e. category D.3 ‘other goods and services’; see 
            Article 6.2.D.3).  
            Before signature of the FEJP GA, the beneficiaries can still opt for declaring the costs not as unit 
            cost,  but  as  actual  costs  (see  Article  6.2.A-E).  (One  cost  form  per  installation  and  access 
            provider.) 
                The use of unit costs for access activities is optional, i.e. each beneficiary/linked third party 
                can decide independently whether to be reimbursed on the basis of unit costs or actual costs.

                If a beneficiary has initially opted for actual costs, it may only change its choice to unit costs 
                through an amendment to the agreement (see Article 55). 
            1.3.3 The costs must fulfil the following eligibility conditions: 
                           fulfil the general conditions for unit costs to be eligible (i.e. units used during the 
                            action duration, necessary, linked to the action, correct calculation, etc.; see Article 
                            6.1(b)) 
                           be incurred for providing access to research infrastructure to other beneficiaries 
            1.3.4 They must be calculated as follows: 
                    amount per unit (see Annex 2a GA)  x  number of units of access actually provided to other beneficiaries 
             
            Example for calculating unit costs of access to research infrastructure: 
            An access provider considers that the unit of access to the installation is calendar days. It provided 200 days of 
            access in year N-1 and 150 days in year N-2. The total cost of providing this access, calculated on the basis of the 
            categories of costs indicated above and the beneficiary’s usual cost-accounting practices, is EUR 50 000 000 for year 
            N-1 and EUR 20 000 000 for year N-2. 
            Unit cost  =  EUR 35 000 000 (average annual total cost)  =    EUR 200 000 per day 
                             175 days (average annual total access) 
            If the access provider makes the installation available for the Fusion programme EJP Cofund action for 50 days in 
            year N, the total to be declared under unit costs for research infrastructure for year N will be EUR 10  000  000.

                                               If the [Commission][Agency] considers that the annual work plan for the next year does not comply 
                                               with Annex 1, the coordinator must submit a revised version within 30 days from receiving formal 
                                               notification. 
                                               If the [Commission][Agency] considers that the revised annual work plan for the next year still 
                                               does not comply with Annex 1, it may terminate the Agreement (see Article 50.3).

                           19.2                Consequences of non-compliance 
                           If the coordinator breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the [Commission][Agency] may apply 
                           any of the measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Deliverable: Annual work plan 
                         What & When? For EJP Cofund actions, the coordinator must submit to the Commission/Agency 
                         — for each twelve-month period of the EJP — an annual work plan. 
                                  This  plan  contains  a  detailed  description  of  the  activities  for  that  period,  in  line  with  the 
                                  objectives and description of work set out in Annex 1. Thus, while Annex 1 may include the 
                                  targeted areas for research or other activities, it is the annual work plan that will define and 
                                  specify the activities and the deliverables.  
                                                   Example:  
                                                   Annex 1 of a EJP contains a work package dedicated to a series of irradiation experiments in a large 
                                                   research facility. The annual work plan for the first reporting period provides a detailed description of 
                                                   the planned experiments on the related materials and the expected milestones.  
                                                   As the programme develops, additional irradiation capacity becomes available in year 3. Alternatively, 
                                                   the validation of previous results requires further work or other materials become interesting. The 
                                                   consortium proposes an annual work plan with additional experiments commencing in that reporting 
                                                   period.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                  EJP Cofund MGA 
                    An EJP consortium therefore has a certain flexibility  to  develop  activities  and  use  the 
                    allocated budget (as long as the proposed activities remain in line with the EJP objectives 
                    and description of work (Annex 1) as initially evaluated) 
                The annual work plan must be drawn up using the template in Annex 7.  
                The periods of the annual work plans coincide with the reporting periods (see Article 20), but 
                the work plans must be submitted 3 months (i.e. 90 days) in advance to allow for review by 
                the Commission/Agency (— except for the annual work plan for the first reporting period, 
                which must already be part of the proposal; see the proposal templates). 
            If the Commission/Agency considers that the proposed annual work plan does not comply with 
            Annex 1, it will ask the coordinator to submit a revised annual work plan (— within 30 days 
            from receiving the request). 
            How? The annual work plan must be uploaded directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
             
            2. Deliverable: Summary progress report 
            What & When? The annual work plan must be accompanied by a summary progress report.  
            The summary progress report should focus on how the activities proposed in the annual work plan 
            ensure continuity with the work already carried out.  
            It should NOT contain an analysis of all activities carried out during the reporting period (since 
            that is the purpose of two other documents that must be submitted as part of the periodic reports, 
            i.e. the explanation of the work carried out and the overview of the progress; see Article 20.3).

                           20.1               Obligation to submit reports  
                           The coordinator must submit to the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52) the technical and financial 
                           reports set out in this Article. These reports include the requests for payment and must be drawn up using 
                             the forms and templates provided in the electronic exchange system (see Article 52). 
                           20.2               Reporting periods 
                           The action is divided into the following ‘reporting periods’: 
                                                  - RP1: from month 1 to month 12  
                                                  - RP2: from month 13 to month 24  
                                                  - RP3: from month 25 to month 36  
                                                  - RP4: from month 37 to month 48  
                                                  - RP5: from month 49 to month 60  
                           20.2a              Request for a second pre-financing payment   
                           [OPTION 1 in case of two pre-financing payments: The coordinator must submit — within 30 days 
                             following the end of the first reporting period — a request for a second pre-financing payment.  
                           The request must be included in a ‘statement on the use of the previous pre-financing payment’ (see 
                           Annex 8).] 
                           [OPTION 2: not applicable]

                         1. Reports 
                         Like the General MGA, the EJP Cofund MGA foresees periodic reports for each reporting period 
                         (including the final one), with both a technical and a financial part (see Article 20 H2020 General 
                         MGA). 
                          
                         2. Reporting periods 
                         EJP Cofund actions are divided in 5 reporting periods of 12 months each. 
                         Each reporting period triggers a periodic report. 
                          
                         3.  Request for a second pre-financing payment — Statement on the use of the 
                                previous pre-financing payment  
                         The GA may provide for this option for large EJPs that need a second pre-financing payment (at 
                         the beginning of the second reporting period; see Article 21). 
                         Payment of further pre-financing payments is not automatic. It must be requested via a statement 
                         on the use of the first pre-financing payment (see Annex 8).

                           The following payments will be made to the coordinator: 
                                     -        a [first] pre-financing payment; 
                                     -        [a second pre-financing payment, on the basis of the request for a second pre-financing payment

                                     -        one or more interim payments, on the basis of the request(s) for interim payment (see Article 20), 
                                              and 
                                     -        one payment of the balance, on the basis of the request for payment of the balance (see Article 
                                              20).

                           The aim of the pre-financing is to provide the beneficiaries with a float.  
                           It remains the property of the EU until the payment of the balance. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will — within 30 days, either from the entry into force of the Agreement (see 
                           Article 58) or from 10 days before the starting date of the action (see Article 3), whichever is the latest —

                           payments: 2,5%] of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), is retained by the Commission and 
                           transferred into the ‘Guarantee Fund’.  
                           [OPTION in case of a second pre-financing payment: The [Commission][Agency] will — within 30 days

                           payment to the coordinator of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], except if Article 48 applies. 
                           From this amount, an amount of EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)], corresponding to 2.5% of 
                            the  maximum  grant  amount  (see  Article  5.1),  will  be  retained  by  the  [Commission][Agency]  and

                            payment has been used to cover the costs of the action, the amount of the new pre-financing to be paid will 
                           be reduced by the difference between the 70 % threshold and the amount used. ]

                           When making payments, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify to the coordinator the amount 
                           due, specifying whether it concerns a [second pre-financing payment,] interim payment or the payment of 
                            the balance.  
                           For the payment of the balance, the notification will also specify the final grant amount.

              In the case of reduction of the grant or recovery of undue amounts, the notification will be preceded by the 
              contradictory procedure set out in Articles 43 and 44.  
              […] 
             
                     
            1. Payments to be made  
            Normally, EJP Cofund actions are divided in 5 reporting periods (see Article 20.2), with one pre-
            financing payment and interim payments for each reporting period.  
            Large EJPs may exceptionally benefit from a second pre-financing payment (at the beginning of 
            the second reporting period). 
                    Example (two pre-financing payments):  
                    An EJP receives a grant with a maximum grant amount of EUR 30 million. A total pre-financing of EUR 8 
                    million is agreed but is split into two pre-financings of EUR 4 million each. 
                       First pre-financing = EUR 4 000 000 with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 2,5% = EUR 
                       750 000  net payment of EUR 3 250 000 
                       Second pre-financing:  
                       1a: The coordinator submits a statement showing that at least EUR 2 275 000 (70% of the EUR 3 250 
                       000) has been used to cover the costs of the action  the second pre-financing will be EUR 4 000 000 
                       with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 2,5% = EUR 750 000 = net payment of EUR 3 250 
                       000 
                       1b: The coordinator submits a statement showing that EUR 1 950 000 (60% of the initial pre-financing) 
                       has been used to cover the costs of the action  the second pre-financing will be EUR 4 000 000 – (EUR 
                       2 275 000 – EUR 1 950 000) = EUR 3 675 000 with a Guarantee Fund retention of EUR 30 million x 
                       2,5% = EUR 750 000  net payment of EUR 2 925 000 
                The second pre-financing payment is NOT automatic but must be requested by the coordinator 
                via a ‘statement on the use of the first pre-financing payment’ (see Article 20). 
            The balance is paid when the action ends. 
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries? 
            Pre-financing payment 
            How much? The pre-financing for EJP Cofund actions is normally 20% of the maximum grant 
            amount set out in Article 5.1 (— unless it is exceptionally fixed higher or lower, to reflect the size 
            and  the  needs  of  the  EJP,  the  reimbursement  rate  in  the  work  programme/call  and/or  the 
            availability of EU budget credits) 
                If the GA foresees a second pre-financing payment, the Guarantee Fund retention (of 5% of 
                the maximum grant amount) will be split between the two pre-financing payments. 
                 
                     The second/third pre-financing payment will be reduced, if — according to the statement on use of the 
                previous pre-financing instalment — the previous pre-financing was not fully used: 
                       if 70% or more of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing is 
                        paid in full 
                       if less than 70% of the first/second pre-financing has been used: the second/third pre-financing will 
                        be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 70%.

                                                                                                                                                                Framework Partnerships and Specific Agreements 
                         FPA/SGA 
                         VIII. Framework Partnerships and Specific Agreements  
                         VIII.1 Background information and approach 
                         The H2020 FPA and H2020 SGA are used for framework partnerships and specific grants (under 
                         such framework partnerships) ONLY. 
                                  ‘Framework partnerships’ are long-term co-operations that:  
                                                  pursue a mutual interest and common general objectives (that coincide with EU policy) 
                                           –       have an action plan with actions that were defined and agreed jointly on the basis of 
                                                   the common general objectives and 
                                           –       have an ongoing formal arrangement to implement (potential) actions (i.e. the FPA and 
                                                   SGAs). 
                                  Currently, framework partnerships are only open to actions under the General MGA (i.e. all 
                                  kinds of research and innovation actions (RIA), innovation actions (IA) and coordination and 
                                  support actions (CSA)) and for PCP/PPI actions. Framework partnerships are currently not 
                                  (yet) open to ERANET, EJP, ERC, MSCA or SME Instrument specific actions. 
                                  As from GA 4.0 FPA/SGAs are also possible for PCP/PPI actions. This does NOT apply to older 
                                  grant agreements. 
                                   
                                                         The FPA/SGA therefore now covers both research and innovation actions or innovation actions with 
                                                   a PCP or PPI and PCP/PPI actions (separate type of action with PCP/PPI as main action task).

                         The FPA and SGA generally follow the General MGA for content, but with a different numbering:

              In addition, all references in the General MGA to ‘beneficiary(ies)’ must be read as referring to the 
              ‘partner(s)’. 
              The  annotations  will  concentrate  on  differences  in  substance  and  interpretation  that  require 
              explanation.  
                   Parts that differ only in numbering or presentation (e.g. Chapters 3 and 4; Annexes) will not 
                   be shown. 
                    By  contrast,  provisions  that  do  not  deviate  from  the  General  MGA,  but  that  require 
                    clarification or a specific interpretation for the FPA or SGA are added: 
                            Article 9.1 (FPA-SGA budget categories) 
                            Article 10 (FPA-SGA maximum grant amount, form of grant, reimbursement rate, forms of 
                             costs, final grant amount, revised final grant amount) 
                            Article 11 (FPA-SGA eligible and ineligible costs) 
                            Article 13 (FPA-SGA rules on third party involvement) 
                            Article 63.2 (FPA/SGA rules on dispute settlement).

                    The  action  plan  should  include  the  common  objectives  of  the  parties  and  the  types  of  activities  covered  under  this  framework 
                    partnership, that contribute to the achievement of those objectives. 
                
                        
             1.  Participants:  Coordinator — Partners — Linked third parties — Third parties 
                 involved in the action 
             In  FPAs  and  SGAs  the  beneficiaries  are  called  ‘partners’  (because  technically  speaking  they 
             become beneficiaries only once an SGA is signed).  
                        Same partners at FPA and SGA level — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
                    However, partners/linked third parties that do not want to actively participate in a specific action, may 
                    participate as partners not carrying out action tasks and will not have to comply with most of the 
                    obligations under that SGA (see Preamble SGA). 
              
             Arrangements for signing the FPA are as follows: 
                      the coordinator signs the FPA directly 
                      the other partners sign the Accession Form (see Article 62 FPA and Annex 3). 
                  The documents must be signed directly in Funding & Tenders Portal. 
                  Amendments to the FPA (and the SGAs) will be signed by the coordinator on behalf of the 
                  other partners.

           Applicants who accept the partnership by signing the FPA become partners to the Agreement and 
           are bound by its terms and conditions. 
           Other entities involved in the partnership which do not sign the FPA (including entities linked to 
           the partners) are considered as third parties involved in the partnership. 
               They  are  not  bound  by  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  FPA  and  SGA;  conversely,  the 
               Commission/Agency has no obligation towards third parties. 
               Only linked third parties are normally involved in the framework partnership itself. Other third 
               parties  are  normally  only  involved  in  the  specific  actions  (third  parties  involved  in  the 
               specific actions).

                           If the [Commission][Agency]  decides to award a specific grant, it will propose the partners to conclude a 
                           ‘Specific Agreement (SGA)’ (see Annex 2).  
                           By  entering  into  the  Specific  Agreement  [OPTION  if  the  JRC  is  a  partner:  or  the  Administrative

                           Specific Agreements must be concluded before the end of the framework partnership (see Article 3).  
                           After  the  end  of  the  framework  partnership  or  its  termination,  the  Framework  Partnership  Agreement 
                            continues to apply to specific actions that are implemented under Specific Agreements which have entered 
                           into force before end of the duration.

           1. Framework partnership — Action plan 
           What?  Framework  partnerships  are  long-term  partnerships  based  on  jointly  agreed  general 
           objectives and a roadmap of actions (action plan). 
               The action plan should normally include at least the following: 
                      the objectives of the partnership (as set out in the work programme/call) 
                      the list of actions covered (including an indicative work plan) 
                      an explanation of how the actions will contribute to the achievement of the objectives 
                      the description of the partners  
                      key performance indicators 
                      information on the arrangements for intellectual property rights and open access (if 
                       relevant at FPA level) 
                      information on ethics and gender issues (if relevant). 
           The partnership is established in a FPA and implemented by SGAs for specific actions.  
               For this purpose, specific grants will be announced in work programmes/calls.  
               The FPA does NOT oblige the Commission/Agency to award specific grants.  
               Specific grants can be awarded only in line with the action plan. 
               The partners remain free to participate also in  other calls for  proposals organised by the 
               Commission/Agency, in order to receive grants outside the action plan. 
           Framework partnerships can in principle be funded in all Parts of Horizon 2020.  
               Currently, they are however only open to actions under the General MGA (i.e. all kinds of 
               research and innovation actions (RIA), innovation actions (IA) and coordination and support 
               actions  (CSA)  (e.g.  H2020-FETFLAG-2014;  H2020-EINFRA-2014-2)  and  PCP-  PPI  actions; 
               Framework partnerships are currently NOT (yet) open to ERANET, EJP, ERC, MSCA or SME 
               Instrument specific actions. 
            
           2. Award of specific grants 
           The specific grants are awarded to partners through one or more of the following procedures 
           (depending on which options were inserted in the FPA): 
               –   with competition (calls for proposals):  
                   –   open to all partners for which this type of activity is included in the FPA action plan 
                       Such calls are restricted to the consortia that have signed a FPA and compete for the 
                       specific grant. 
                           Example: The Commission signs different FPAs. In the call for proposals for specific grants, it 
                           establishes that participation is restricted to applicants who have already signed an FPA. Consortia 
                           A and B have signed FPAs with the Commission – FPA-1 in the case of Consortium A and FPA-2 in 
                           the  case  of  Consortium  B.  Following  submission  of  the  proposal  and  a  positive  evaluation, 
                           Consortium B is awarded the grant and signs an SGA with the Commission in the framework of 
                           FPA-2. 
                   –   open to all applicants meeting the criteria

                       Such calls are open to any legal entity that satisfies the criteria set out in the call for 
                       proposals. 
                  without competition:  
                      invitations to submit a proposal 
                       Such invitations can only be issued in one of the following cases: 
                              in monopoly situations or where partners are designated in the basic act 
                           –   if  work  is  carried  out  in  a  network  with  pre-determined  partners  under 
                               conditions laid down in the basic acts  
                           –   for actions with specific characteristics that require a particular type of body on 
                               account  of  its  technical  competence,  high  degree  of  specialisation  or 
                               administrative capacity, and do not fall within the scope of a call for proposals 
                      submission of a proposal by a certain date 
                       This  option  can  be  included  in  the  FPA  only  if  it  is  provided  for  in  the  work 
                       programme/call.  
                       The date must be set out in the action plan or in Article 2 FPA.

                           ARTICLE 3 — DURATION AND STARTING DATE OF THE FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP 
                           The Framework Partnership Agreement is concluded for a period of [insert number] of months ([…]years)9 
                           as of its entry into force (see Article 64). This period cannot be extended. 
                            
                            9        Not more than four years, except in duly justified  exceptional  cases  (for  instance, to align it  with  the  duration  of  the  framework 
                                     programme) (Article 178 Rules of Application Regulation No 1268/2012). 
                            
                                            
                         1. Framework partnership starting date 
                         The starting date of the framework partnership is fixed by the Commission/Agency in the FPA. 
                         It is usually the first day of the month following the date on which the FPA enters into force. The 
                         FPA enters into force when the last party signs it (see Article 64 FPA). 
                                  Example: The FPA is signed by the coordinator on 30 December 2014 and by the Commission on 5 January 
                                  2015. The starting date of the partnership is 1 February 2015. 
                          
                         2. Framework partnership duration 
                         The  framework  partnership  duration  may  not  exceed  four  years,  except  in  duly  justified 
                         exceptional cases (e.g. to align it with the duration of the Horizon 2020 Programme). 
                         The FPA duration can NOT be extended (i.e. it is not possible to request an amendment extending 
                         the duration). The duration of an FPA only determines the moment up to which SGAs can be 
                         signed. The SGAs can still be implemented after the end of the framework partnership. 
                         All SGAs must be signed before the end of the FPA. 
                                   Certain provisions of the FPA will continue to apply for the on-going SGAs even if the FPA has ended.

                                      -       other matters of common interest related to the Framework Partnership Agreement. 
                          
                            The partners must implement the framework partnership in compliance with Articles 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 
                           52 — mutatis mutandis. 
                           4.2 Consortium agreement 
                           [OPTION 1 to be used, unless the work programme specifies that there is no need for a consortium 
                           agreement: The partners must have internal arrangements regarding their operation and co-ordination to 
                            ensure that the framework partnership and the specific actions are implemented properly. These internal 
                           arrangements must be set out in a written ‘consortium agreement’ between the partners, which may cover:  
                                     -        internal organisation of the consortium; 
                                     -        management of access to the electronic exchange system; 
                                     -        distribution of EU funding; 
                                     -        additional rules on rights and obligations related to background and results (including whether 
                                              access rights remain or not, if a partner is in breach of its obligations) (see Subsection 3 of Chapter 
                                              3); 
                                     -        settlement of internal disputes;  
                                     -        liability, indemnification and confidentiality arrangements between the partners. 
                           The  consortium  agreement  must  not  contain  any  provision  contrary  to  the  Framework  Partnership 
                           Agreement and the Specific Agreements.]  
                           [OPTION 2: Not applicable] 
                                            
                         1. Consortium agreement 
                         As a general rule, the partners must conclude a FPA consortium agreement to ensure a smooth 
                         and successful implementation of the framework partnership and the specific actions (like for GAs; 
                         see Article 41.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                                              If necessary, the consortium may decide to have — in addition to the FPA consortium agreement — 
                                       specific consortium agreements for each SGA. In this case, the consortium will need to ensure a 
                                       mechanism to settle possible conflicts between the different consortium agreements.

                           ARTICLE 5 — SUSPENSION OF FRAMEWORK PARTNERSHIP IMPLEMENTATION 
                           The  parties  may  suspend  the  implementation  of  the  framework  partnership  on  the  grounds  and 
                           according to the procedure — mutatis mutandis — set out in Article 55. 
                           If  the  framework  partnership  implementation  is  suspended,  all  specific  actions  are  also  suspended  (see 
                            Article 55) — from the date of suspension of the framework partnership.

                         The rules on suspension of framework partnership implementation are similar to GA suspension 
                         (see Article 49 H2020 General MGA).  
                          
                                                FPA suspension automatically supends all on-going specific actions. 
                                            
                         Amendments (to resume the action) after a suspension can NOT have the effect of extending the 
                                                   
                         FPA duration set out in Article 3 FPA. ). The duration of an FPA only determines the moment up to

                           6.1                Termination of the Agreement  
                           The parties may terminate the Framework Partnership Agreement at any time.  
                           The party terminating the Framework Partnership Agreement must formally notify termination to the other 
                            party, stating the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
                           Termination of the Framework Partnership Agreement does not release the parties from their obligations 
                           under Specific Agreements which have entered into force before the date on which the termination takes 
                           effect, unless they have been terminated.  
                           Neither party may claim damages due to termination by the other party. 
                           6.2                Termination of the participation of one or more partners  
                           The parties may terminate participation of one or more partners in the framework partnership on the grounds 
                            and according to the procedures — mutatis mutandis — set out in Article 56.2.1, 56.3.1 and 56.3.2. 
                           The coordinator must submit a request for amendment (see Article 61) to adapt Annex 1 and, if necessary, 
                           the addition of one or more new partners (see Article 62).   
                           If  the  request  for  amendment  is  rejected  by  the  [Commission][Agency],  the  Framework  Partnership 
                            Agreement may be terminated (see above). 
                           Termination of participation in the framework partnership does not release the partner concerned from its 
                           obligations under Specific Agreements. It cannot however participate in specific actions awarded after the 
                            date on which the termination takes effect.

                         The FPA can be terminated at any time and on any grounds, without the need for a contradictory 
                         procedure between the parties. 
                                   
                                                FPA termination has NO effect on ongoing SGAs (— unless they are also terminated; see Article 56 FPA 
                                         and Article 20 SGA). Certain provisions of the FPA will continue to apply for the on-going SGAs even if the 
                                         FPA is terminated.

                         The pa rties may terminate the participation of a partner in the framework partnership on similar 
                         grounds (and according to similar procedures)  as their  termination  in  actions  (see  Article  50

                      Different partners at FPA and SGA level (exceptional) — Beneficiary termination may lead to a 
                   different consortium composition at FPA and SGA level — unless participation is ended on both levels (and 
                   for ALL SGAs). 
                       This  is  one  of  the  very  few  cases  of  a  different  consortium  composition.  Normally,  consortium 
                       composition is the same, but partners/linked third parties can participate as partners not carrying out 
                       action tasks for certain specific actions. 
                        Example: A partner wants to terminate participation in the framework partnership because it no longer has 
                       interest in future SGAs (while it wants to finish the ongoing ones it has committed to).

                           10.1               Maximum grant amount 
                           The maximum grant amount for the specific grants is set out in the Specific Agreements (see Article 4 
                            SGA).  
                           10.2               Form of grant, reimbursement rates and form(s) of costs 
                           The form of the grant, reimbursement rate(s), estimated eligible costs and the form(s) of costs of the specific 
                           grants are set out in the Specific Agreements (see Article 4 SGA). 
                           10.3               Final grant amount — Calculation 
                           The final grant amount of a specific grant depends on the actual extent to which the specific action is 
                           implemented in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Framework Partnership Agreement and the 
                            Specific Agreement concerned.  
                           This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
                           Article 17 SGA) — in the following steps:  
                                     Step 1 – Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs 
                                     Step 2 – Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                                     Step 3 – Reduction due to the no-profit rule 
                                     Step 4 – Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious  breach of obligations 
                           10.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rates to the eligible costs 
                           The reimbursement rate(s) (see Article 4 SGA) are applied to the eligible costs (actual costs, unit costs, flat-
                            rate costs and lump sum costs; see Article 5 SGA) declared by the partners [and the linked third parties] 
                           (see Article 16 SGA) and approved by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 17 SGA). 
                           10.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to the maximum grant amount 
                           If the amount obtained following Step 1 is higher than the maximum grant amount (see Article 4 SGA), it 
                           will be limited to the latter. 
                           10.3.3 Step 3 — Reduction due to the no-profit rule 
                           The specific grant must not produce a profit.  
                           ‘Profit’ means the surplus of the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2 plus the specific action’s total 
                            receipts, over the specific action’s total eligible costs.  
                           The  ‘specific  action’s  total  eligible  costs’  are  the  consolidated  total  eligible  costs  approved  by  the 
                           [Commission][Agency]. 
                           The ‘specific action’s total receipts’ are the consolidated total receipts generated during its duration (see 
                            Article 3 SGA).

             The following are considered receipts: 
                 (a)  income generated by the specific action; if the income is generated from selling  equipment or other 
                     assets purchased under the Specific Agreement, the receipt is up to the amount declared as eligible 
                     under the Specific Agreement; 
                 (b)  financial contributions given by third parties to the partner [or to a linked third party]  specifically 
                     to be used for the specific action, and 
                 (c)  in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge specifically to be used for the specific 
                     action, if they have been declared as eligible costs. 
            
             The following are however not considered receipts: 
            
                 (a)  income generated by exploiting the specific action’s results (see Article 34); 
                 (b)  financial contributions by third parties, if they may be used to cover costs other than the eligible 
                     costs (see Article 5 SGA); 
                 (c)  financial contributions by third parties with no obligation to repay any amount unused at the end of 
                     the period set out in Article 3 of the Specific Agreement). 
             If there is a profit, it will be deducted from the amount obtained following Steps 1 and 2. 
             10.3.4  Step  4 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                     obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
             If the specific grant is reduced (see Article 49), the [Commission][Agency] will  calculate the reduced grant 
             amount by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, 
             irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations in accordance with Article 49.2) from the maximum grant 
             amount (see Article 4 SGA). 
             The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                 -   the amount obtained following Steps 1 to 3 or  
                 -   the reduced grant amount following Step 4. 
             10.4    Revised final grant amount — Calculation 
             If  — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
             Article 28) — the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs (see Article 48) or reduces the specific grant (see 
             Article 49), it will calculate the ‘revised final grant amount’ for the partner concerned by the findings.  
             This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] on the basis of the findings, as follows:  
                 -   in  case  of  rejection  of  costs:  by  applying  the  reimbursement  rate  to  the  revised  eligible  costs 
                     approved by the [Commission][Agency] for the partner concerned; 
                 -   in case of reduction of the specific grant: by calculating  the concerned partner’s share in the grant 
                     amount reduced in proportion to to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or  breach of 
                     obligations (see Article 49.2).  
             In case of rejection of costs and reduction of the specific grant: the revised final grant amount for the 
             partner concerned will be the lower of the two amounts above.

           1. Form of grant — Reimbursement rates — Cost form(s) 
           The form of grant, reimbursement rates and cost form(s) of the SGA will depend on the type of

                         The rules on third party involvement will depend on the type of SGA used. 
                                  Example: For RIA, IA and CSA specific actions, the SGA will use the rules on third party involvement of the

                         Linked third parties must already be identified in the FPA (see Article 19 FPA). Their specific 
                         activities must then be set out in the specific actions.  
                                  Examples: 
                                  1. Third parties making resources available against payment or free of charge (see Articles 9 and 10 FPA) must 
                                  be identified in Annex I of the SGA.  
                                  2. Linked third parties carrying out specific action task must be identified in the FPA and also in Annex I of the 
                                  relevant SGAs 
                                   
                                              Linked  third  parties  —  Linked  third  parties  are  allowed  to  fully  participate  in  the  framework 
                                       partnership and specific actions, like the partner they are linked to.   
                                       Linked  third  parties  can  NOT  however  do  more  than  their  partners:  If  a  linked  third  party  wants  to 
                                       participate in a specific action, its partner must also be active in that action (i.e. NOT be partner not

                           62.1               Accession of the partners mentioned in the preamble 
                           The other partners must accede to the Framework Partnership Agreement by signing the Accession Form 
                            (see Annex 3) in the electronic exchange system (see Article 58) — within 30 days after its entry into force 
                           (see Article 64). [OPTION if Article 19 applies and joint and several liability has been requested: and for 
                            partners for which the [Commission][Agency] has requested joint and several liability of a linked third 
                           party, by also submitting — at accession to the Framework Partnership Agreement — a declaration on joint 
                           and several liability (see Annex 3a) signed by the third party.] 
                           All  partners  having  acceded  to  the  Framework  Partnership  Agreement  must  be  part  of  the  Specific 
                            Agreements. The partners will accede to the Specific Agreements by signature of the coordinator (see 
                           mandate in Annex 3). 
                           They will assume the rights and obligations under the Agreements with effect from the date of their entry 
                            into force (see Article 64 and Article 21 SGA). 
                           If  a  partner  does  not  accede  to  the  Framework  Partnership  Agreement  within  the  above  deadline,  the 
                           coordinator must — within 30 days — request an amendment to make any changes necessary to ensure 
                            proper  implementation  of  the  action  plan.  This  does  not  affect  the  [Commission’s][Agency’s]  right  to 
                           terminate the agreements (see Articles 6 and 56).  
                          
                            
                                            
                         1. Accession to the FPA and SGAs 
                         While the coordinator signs the FPA, the other partners must accede to the FPA by means of the 
                         Accession Forms.  
                                  In doing so, they mandate the coordinator: 
                                                  to  submit  and  sign  in  their  name  and  on  their  behalf  any  amendments  to  the 
                                                   framework 
                                                  to sign in their name and on their behalf any SGA that may be awarded. 
                                          The SGAs are signed ONLY by the coordinator. The other partners do NOT need to sign accession forms 
                                    for the SGAs.

                           62.2               Addition of new partners 
                           In justified cases, the partners may request the addition of a new partner. 
                           For this purpose, the coordinator must submit a request for amendment of the Framework Partnership and 
                           the Specific Agreements in accordance with Article 61. It must include an Accession Form (see Annex 3) 
                            signed by the new partner in the electronic exchange system (see Article 58).  
                           New partners must assume the rights and obligations under the Agreements with effect from the date of their 
                           accession specified in the Accession Form (see Annex 3). 
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Addition of a new partner 
                         New partners can be added at any moment of the framework partnership. 
                                              Same partners at FPA and SGA level — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
                                        The new partner must therefore be added at both levels. 
                                   
                                  Before any SGA has been concluded, only the FPA must be amended. 
                                  Once an SGA has already been concluded, both the FPA and the SGA must be amended.  
                         The coordinator must first submit a request for the FPA amendment (which will automatically 
                         include the change in the consortium composition for the SGAs — the new beneficiary is added 
                         (automatically) as ‘inactive’ to all signed SGAs under that FPA). 
                         The coordinator must then request for each SGA a separate amendment to activate the new 
                         beneficiary (e.g. to change Annex 1, Annex 2). 
                         The conditions for accepting new partners are the same as under the General MGA (see Article 
                         56.2 H2020 General MGA).

                           If a dispute concerning the interpretation, application or validity of the Framework Partnership Agreement 
                           or a Specific Agreement cannot be settled amicably, the General Court — or, on appeal, the Court of Justice 
                            of the European Union — has sole jurisdiction. Such actions must be brought under Article 272 of the 
                           Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). 
                           [additional OPTION for non-EU partners (except partners established in an associated country with an 
                           association  agreement  to  Horizon  2020  that  stipulates  sole  jurisdiction  of  the  European  Court  of 
                            Justice): As an exception, if such a dispute is between the [Commission][Agency] and [insert non-EU 
                           partner(s) name(s)], the competent Belgian courts have sole jurisdiction.] 
                           [additional OPTION for international organisations and for partners not eligible for EU funding which 
                            according  to  their  national  law  cannot  be  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Belgian  courts:  As  an 
                           exception, for the following partners:  
                                     -        [insert name of international organisation or partner not eligible for EU funding]  
                                     -        [insert name of international organisation or partner not eligible for EU funding] 
                                     [same for other partners that are international organisations or partner not eligible for EU funding] 
                            such disputes must — if they cannot be settled amicably — be referred to arbitration. Each party must 
                           formally notify to the other party its intention of resorting to arbitration and the identity of the arbitrator.  
                           The Permanent Court of Arbitration Optional Rules for Arbitration Involving International Organisations 
                            and States in force at the date of entry into force of the Framework Partnership Agreement will apply. The 
                           appointing  authority  will  be  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Permanent  Court  of  Arbitration  following  a 
                            written request submitted by either party. The arbitration proceedings must take place in Brussels and the 
                           language used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. The arbitral award will be binding on all parties 
                            and will not be subject to appeal.] 
                           If a dispute concerns administrative sanctions, offsetting or an enforceable decision under Article 299 TFEU 
                           (see Articles 50, 51 and 52), the partners must bring action before the General Court — or, on appeal, the 
                            Court of Justice of the European Union — under Article 263 TFEU. Actions against enforceable decisions 
                           must always be brought against the Commission (not against the Agency — even in Agency specific 
                           grants). 
                             
                                            
                         1. Dispute settlement 
                         The rules on dispute settlement are similar to those of the General MGA (see Article 57.2 H2020 
                         General MGA).  
                         However for FPAs, the Commission/Agency will determine already at FPA-level which partners 
                         must participate as ‘beneficiaries not receiving EU funding’ — because of a general issue with the 
                         jurisdiction clause (i.e. Belgian courts). Those beneficiaries can NEVER receive EU funding. 
                         All other partners’ status will be determined at SGA-level. Thus, partners from eligible countries  
                         (EU Member State, H2020 associated country or third country listed in General Annex A to the 
                         Main  Work  Programme) may participate  as  normal  partners  or  as  ‘partners  not  receiving  EU 
                         funding’.  Partners  from  non-eligible  countries  may  participate  as  ‘partners  not  receiving  EU 
                         funding’ or — exceptionally — be granted funding.

                     The  person  representing  the  Commission/Agency  must  be  an  authorising  officer  (by  delegation  or  sub-delegation)  designated  in 
                    accordance with document 60008 of 22.02.2001 ‘Mise en place de la Charte des ordonnateurs’. 
                
              
                        
             1. Participants: Partners — Partners not carrying out action tasks under the SGA 
                 — Linked third parties 
             The partners of a SGA are generally the same as the partners of the FPA (see Article 62.1 
             FPA). 
                   
                      Same partners at FPA and SGA level — Partners must generally be the same at FPA and SGA level. 
                  An entity that is not partner/linked third party in the FPA cannot become party in the SGA. Conversely, all 
                  partners/linked third parties to the FPA become parties to the SGA. 
                   
                   
             However, not all  partners  of  a  framework  partnership  must  actively  participate  in  all  specific 
             actions.  
                  Partners (and linked third parties) who do NOT actively participate in a specific action are 
                  partners  not  carrying  out  action  tasks  under  that  Specific  Agreement  (and  must  be 
                  identified as such in the preamble to the SGA).  
                             Partners not carrying out action tasks — They formally participate in the action as partners, 
                          but NOT with any action tasks or EU funding. In practice, most of the obligations therefore do not 
                          apply to them for that specific action. 
                          Linked third parties — If a partner participates as not carrying out action tasks, its linked third 
                          parties get the same status. They can NOT actively participate in the specific action (— unless they 
                          themselves become partners of the FPA and SGA). 
                        
             SGA                                                                                                                     769 
           H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                        SGA 
            
                   These partners are formally part of the consortium for the SGA (and are parties to this 
                   SGA, meaning that the coordinator signs also in their name).  
                   They will be identified in Annex 1 as 'partners not carrying action tasks' (as they do not 
                   carry out any action tasks). Moreover, they will also be mentioned in Annex 2 with zero 
                   costs. 
                   Formally, the rights and obligations under the FPA and SGA fully apply to them. In practice 
                   however,  many  of  them  (e.g.  implementation,  deliverables,  technical  and  financial 
                   reporting, keeping of supporting documents, financial or technical audits or reviews, IPR 
                   results, access to background and results of others, etc.) are NOT applicable because these 
                   partners do not carry out action tasks and do not receive any EU funding. Other obligations 
                   remain relevant (e.g. checks, information obligations, confidentiality). 
           SGAs are signed by the coordinator on behalf of the other partners (see Article 62.1 FPA). 
               The documents must be signed directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal. 
               The other partners do NOT need to sign Accession Forms. 
           Other entities involved in a specific action which do not sign the SGA (including linked third 
           parties) are considered as third parties involved in the specific action.

                           The duration of the specific action will be [insert number] months as of [OPTION 1 by default: the first day 
                           of the month following the date the Specific Agreement enters into force (see Article 21)] [OPTION 2 if 
                             needed for the action: insert date] (‘starting date of the action’).  
                            
                              
                            
                                             
                         1. Action starting date 
                         For MSCA-IF, the rules on the action starting date are in principle the same as in the General MGA 
                         (see Article 3 H2020 General MGA).Normally, the SGA starting date should also be after the entry 
                         into force of the FPA (because one presumes the other). However, in justified cases, it is possible 
                         to exceptionally fix an SGA starting date before the entry into force of the FPA (i.e. retroactive). 
                         If the consortium requests a starting date before the entry into force of the FPA, it assumes the 
                         risks implied by starting the action before the FPA and SGA are signed (in particular not being 
                         reimbursed for the costs incurred, e.g. if the proposal is not successful or that the FPA/SGA are 
                         not signed). 
                                     The SGA action starting date can in any case NEVER be before the submission of the SGA proposal.

                         1. Minimum number of partners 
                         The minimum number of partners generally depends on the type of specific action. 
                                  For SGAs, the minimum number of partners will be explicitly indicated in the call for proposals 
                                  (or — if there is no call for proposals — in the work programme and the invitation to submit a 
                                  proposal). The minimum numbers of partners refers to the partners implementing the specific 
                                  action. 
                                            Same partners at FPA and SGA level — If a specific action requires more partners than are currently 
                                      in the framework partnership, the FPA first needs to be enlarged.

                         The General Lump Sum Model Grant Agreement (H2020 General Lump Sum MGA) is used mainly 
                         for coordination and support actions (CSA) and, exceptionally, for research and innovation actions 
                         (RIA) and innovation actions (IA) — if the work programme/call provides for a lump sum grant. 
                                Example: H2020-INNOSUP-2014-5  
                         The Lump Sum Pilot Model Grant Agreement (H2020 Lump Sum Pilot MGA) is used in a limited 
                         number of cases provided for in the work programme/call. 
                                Example:  Specific  call  within  the  Nanotechnologies,  Advance  Materials,  Biotechnology  and  Advance

           The main difference between the General Lump Sum MGA and the Lump Sum Pilot MGA lies in the 
           grant implementation mechanisms: the General Lump Sum MGA works with eligible costs and pre-
           financing payments (instead of interim payments); the Lump Sum Pilot MGA works with lump sum 
           shares per work package and beneficiary (instead of eligible costs) and interim payments based on 
           accomplished work packages. 
           The  annotations  will  concentrate  on  differences  in  substance  and  interpretation  that  require 
           explanation.  
              Parts that do not apply (Articles 6, 10, 11, 12, 42 Lump Sum Pilot MGA) or differ only in 
              presentation (e.g. Articles 4.2, 9, 11, 12, 16, 20.5, 21.3, 25.5 General Lump Sum MGA, Article 
              43.3 Lump Sum Pilot MGA, Annexes) will not be shown. 
              For  the  Lump  Sum  Pilot  MGA,  the  Articles  where  the  only  difference  is  the  removal  of 
              references to eligibility of costs (e.g. Article 14, 14a, 17.1, 22.5, 41.2 – removal of CFS —) or 
              rejection of costs (e.g. Articles 14.2, 15.3, 16.3, 18.2, 22.6) will not be shown. 
           The annotations are based on the multi-beneficiary version, since it is the most common for lump 
           sum actions. Where there are significant differences (i.e. Articles 21, 41, 44, 49 and 50), the 
           mono-beneficiary version of the Article is shown.

                         Since these grants consist in a single lump sum, there is only one budget category.

                                                  costs (direct and indirect costs) 
                          
                                    The budget categories are relevant for the estimated budget (Article 4 and Annex 2), forms of costs (Article 
                             5), cost eligibility rules (Article 6.2) and the cost declarations (i.e. financial statements; Article 20 and Annex 4).

                           […%] of the action’s eligible costs] (see Article 6) (‘reimbursement of eligible costs grant’) (see Annex 
                             2). 
                           The estimated eligible costs of the action are EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                           Eligible costs (see Article 6) must be declared as the lump sum set out in Annex 2 (i.e. under the form of 
                           ‘lump sum costs’). 
                            
                             8       For the definition, see Article 2.1 (6) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 
                                     2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in 'Horizon 2020  – the Framework Programme for Research and 
                                     Innovation (2014 – 2020)' ('Rules for Participation Regulation No 1290/2013') (OJ L 347, 20.12.2013 p. 81): 'innovation action' 
                                     means an action primarily consisting of activities directly aiming at producing plans and arrangements or designs for new, altered or 
                                     improved products, processes or services. For this purpose they may include prototyping, testing, demonstrating, piloting, large-scale 
                                     product validation and market replication. 
                            
                              
                                            
                         1. Maximum grant amount — Reimbursement rate — Cost forms  
                         How much & which form? The General Lump Sum MGA does not use the cost forms of the 
                         General MGA, but is a lump sum grant.  
                                  The use of the lump sum will be set out in the work programme/call.  
                                  The lump sum will be set to give a round amount when the EU reimbursement rate is applied 
                                  (—  important  if  the  reimbursement  rate  is  not  100%).  It  is  one  amount  (for  the  entire 
                                  consortium).  
                         The  eligibility  conditions  are  set  out  in  Article  6.  If  the  action  is  correctly  implemented,  the 
                         beneficiaries are entitled to receive this fixed amount of EU funding (lump sum). 
                                              The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs that are incurred for the action. NO 
                                       other costs will be reimbursed.

                               5.3               Final grant amount — Calculation 
                                
                               The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the proper implementation of the action in accordance with the 
                               Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
                               This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
                               Article 21) — in the following steps:  
                                        Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate  
                                        Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations 
                               5.3.1 Step 1 — Application of the reimbursement rate to the eligible costs 
                               The reimbursement rate (see Article 5.2) is applied to the eligible costs (lump sum costs; see Article 6) 
                               declared by the consortium and approved by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 21). 
                               5.3.2  Step  2  —  Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  breach  of 
                                                 obligations— Reduced maximum grant amount — Calculation 
                               If the grant is reduced (see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency] will calculate the reduced maximum 
                               grant amount by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the seriousness of the 
                               errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) from the maximum 
                               grant amount set out in Article 5.1. 
                               In this case, the final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                                        -           the amount obtained in Step 1 or  
                                                  
                                        -           the amount obtained in Step 2. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For  General  Lump  Sum  grants,  the  rules  on  the  calculation  of  the  final  grant  amount  are  in 
                         principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared is pre-filled by the system), 
                         there is NO need to calculate the: 
                                                    limit to the maximum grant amount or  
                                                    reduction due to the no-profit rule.

                         Lump sum > Chapter 3 > Article 5.4 
                           5.4                Revised final grant amount — Calculation 
                           If — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
                           Article 22) — the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs (see Article 42) or reduces the grant (see Article 43), 
                            it will calculate the ‘revised final grant amount’.  
                          
                           This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] on the basis of the findings, as follows:  
                                     -        in  case  of  rejection  of  costs:  by  applying  the  reimbursement rate  to the  revised eligible costs 
                                              approved by the [Commission][Agency]; 
                                               
                                     -        in case of reduction of the grant: in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or 
                                              fraud or breach of obligations (see Article 43.2).  
                                      
                           In case of rejection of costs and reduction of the grant, the revised final grant amount will be the lower of 
                            the two amounts above.  
                          
                             
                          
                             
                                            
                         1. Revised final grant amount 
                         For General Lump Sum grants, the rules on the calculation of the revised final grant amount are in 
                         principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However,  for  General  Lump  Sum  grants,  improper  implementation  of  the  action  leads  to 
                         ineligibility  of  the  costs  (NOT  to  the  reduction  of  the  grant).  Therefore,  the  grant  reduction 
                         mentioned in this provision does not relate to improper implementation of the action (but only to 
                         other breaches and substantial errors, irregularities and fraud; see Article 43).

                                      (b)  costs declared under another EU or Euratom grant (including grants awarded by a Member State

                             Declared costs that are ineligible will be rejected (see Article 42).  
                             This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.  
                            
                                            
                         1. Eligible costs  
                         The  General  Lump  Sum  MGA  has  its  own  budget  category,  with  its  own  types  of  costs, 
                         eligibility conditions and calculation rules.

                         2.1 What? The budget category A ‘costs’ covers the (direct and indirect) costs for the action. 
                                   
                                            The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs that are incurred for the action. NO 
                                    other costs will be reimbursed. 
                                               
                         2.2 These costs must be declared as the amount set out in the work programme/call. 
                                      
                         In practice, the declaration of costs for General Lump Sum grants is completely automatized. The 
                                      
                         coordinator only needs to sign and submit the financial statement (pre-filled by the IT system).

                           7.1                General obligation to properly implement the action 
                            
                             The beneficiaries must implement the action as described in Annex 1 and in compliance with the provisions 
                           of the Agreement and all legal obligations under applicable EU, international and national law.  
                           7.2                Consequences of non-compliance  
                              
                           If a beneficiary does not properly implement the action (or part of it), the corresponding costs will be 
                           ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42). 
                           If a beneficiary breaches any other obligation, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                           This may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                              
                                            
                         1. Consequences of improper implementation 
                         For General Lump Sum grants, ‘improper implementation of the action not in accordance with 
                         Annex 1’ does NOT lead to a reduction of the grant, but to the ineligibility of the costs (see Article 
                         6.1). 
                                   
                                             If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, costs will be rejected proportionally to the 
                                       tasks or parts of the action not implemented (see Article 42).  
                                        
                                        
                         By contrast, in case of other serious breaches the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).

                           The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                           If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                      -        purchase goods, works and services (see Article 10);   
                                      -        call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 13); 
                                      -        call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14).  
                                      -        call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1 (see Article 14a). 
                           In  these  cases,  the  beneficiaries  retain  sole  responsibility  towards  the  [Commission][Agency]    for 
                             implementing the action.

                         The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable to the General 
                         Lump Sum MGA. 
                         The special rules from the General MGA on third party involvement are limited in General Lump 
                         Sum actions to purchases (Article 10), subcontracting (Article 13), linked third parties (Article 14) 
                         and international partners (Article 14a).  
                         By contrast, there are NO special rules for in-kind contributions (Articles 11 and 12). Beneficiaries 
                         may use any in-kind contributions from third parties if they are needed to carry out the work of 
                         the action.  
                          
                                     For  all  types  of  third  party  involvement  (purchases,  subcontracts,  linked  third  parties,  in-kind 
                              contributions), the costs are ALL covered by the lump sum. NO other costs will be reimbursed.

                         are almost identical to the General MGA (see Article 13 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The  obligations  in  Article  10.1.1  are  however  NOT  considered  to  be  additional  cost  eligibility

                         reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).

                           The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
                           subcontractors. 
                           Beneficiaries  that  are  ‘contracting  authorities’  within  the  meaning  of  Directive  2004/18/EC  (or 
                          
                             2014/24/EU)  or ‘contracting entities’ within the meaning of Directive 2004/17/EC (or 2014/25/EU) must 
                           comply with the applicable national law on public procurement. 
                           13.2               Consequences of non-compliance 
                              
                           If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                          
                                            
                         1. Subcontracting 
                         The rules on subcontracting for General Lump Sum actions are similar to the General MGA (see 
                         Articles 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The General Lump Sum MGA has however the following specificities: 
                         The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT have to be included in Annex 1 or shown in the table 
                         of estimated costs of Annex 2 (since they are covered by the lump sum). 
                         The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
                         ‘other obligations’. In case of breach, the Commission/Agency may therefore reduce the grant in 
                         proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).

                            The beneficiaries must — for a period of [OPTION 1 by default: five][OPTION 2 for low value grants : 
                           three] years after the payment of the balance — keep adequate records and other supporting documentation 
                           to prove the proper implementation of the action and the costs they declare as eligible. 
                           They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                            investigations (see Article 22).  
                           If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                           Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
                            other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures. 
                           The  beneficiaries  must  keep  the  original  documents.  Digital  and  digitalised  documents  are  considered 
                           originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission][Agency] may accept non-
                            original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance. 
                           18.1.1 Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation 
                           The  beneficiaries  must  keep  records  and  other  supporting  documentation  on  scientific  and  technical 
                           implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in the respective field. 
                           18.1.2 Records and other documentation to support the costs declared 
                           The beneficiaries must keep adequate records and documentation and other supporting documentation to 
                           prove that the corresponding tasks or part of the action as described in Annex 1 were implemented properly. 
                           The  beneficiaries  do  not  need  to  identify  the  actual  eligible  costs  covered  or  provide  supporting 
                            documentation (such as accounting statements) to prove the amount declared as a lump sum.

                            If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, costs insufficiently substantiated will be 
                           ineligible (see Article 6) and will be rejected (see Article 42).  
                           Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6.

                                   applicable to the general budget of the Union (OJ L 362, 31.12.2012, p. 1) ('Rules of Application Regulation No 1268/2012'):

                         1. Records and other supporting documentation  
                         For General Lump Sum actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep full records on their actual 
                         costs; they only need to keep the evidence (documentation, records) that the actions tasks (as 
                         described in Annex 1) were properly carried out.  
                         The records and supporting documentation must: 
                                          refer to the technical implementation of the action in line with the accepted standards in 
                                           the respective field (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA) and

                   prove that the tasks or parts of the action allocated to the beneficiary in Annex 1 were 
                    implemented properly (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA). 
            By contrast, timesheets or invoices for costs incurred are NOT needed. 
            The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. 
            It must be correctly archived — for at least 5 years after the balance is paid (three years for 
            grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations 
            or litigation). In this case, the evidence must be kept until they end. 
                If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
             reduced (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

              20.8    Consequences of non-compliance  
              If  the  reports  submitted  do  not  comply  with  this  Article,  the  [Commission][Agency]  may  suspend  the 
              payment deadline (see Article 47) and apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
              If the coordinator breaches its obligation to submit the reports and if it fails to comply with this obligation 
             within 30 days following a written reminder, the [Commission][Agency] may terminate the Agreement (see 
              Article 50) or apply any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
               
                     
            1. Reports 
            What & When? For General Lump Sum actions, the coordinator must submit a periodic report 
            after the end of each reporting period (including the final one). 
            Before the end of the action, these are only technical reports, with information on the technical 
            implementation. 
                List of documents for the technical reports: 
                       explanation of the work carried out 
                       overview of the progress 
                       summary for publication 
                       questionnaire (i.e. the structured information requested) 
                       statement on the use of the previous pre-financing instalment 
            NO financial reporting is needed during the action (i.e. no financial statements before the final 
            report). The coordinator only has to sign and submit a statement on the use of the previous pre-
            financing instalment (which includes the request for further pre-financing payments; see Article 
            7). 
            How? Each periodic report must be prepared by the coordinator and the other beneficiaries 
            together, directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal). 
             
            2. Reporting periods 
            General Lump Sum actions are normally divided into several reporting periods and each reporting 
            period triggers a further pre-financing.  
            Each reporting period triggers a periodic report. 
             
            3. Final financial report: Financial statement 
            The financial statement (one common financial statement for the consortium) is automatically pre-
            filled by the system (with the amount set out in the work programme/call as final grant amount; 
            see Article 5).

                  requested  by  the  coordinator  via  a  statement  on  the  use  of  the  previous  pre-financing 
                  payment (see Article 20). 
             There are NO interim payments. 
             The balance is paid when the action ends. 
              
             2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
             Pre-financing payment 
             How much? There is  no  standard  amount  (or  percentage)  for  pre-financing  payments;  the 
             amount is fixed in each GA. 
                   
                       The total amount of pre-financing can NOT exceed 90 % of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1). 
                  The further (i.e. second/third/same for more) pre-financing payment(s) will be reduced, if — according to 
                  the  statement  on  the  use  of  the  previous  pre-financing  payment  —  the  previous  pre-financing  was 
                   
                  insufficiently used: 
                           if 70% or more of the previous pre-financing has been used: the next pre-financing is paid in full 
                           if less than 70% of the previous pre-financing has been used: the next pre-financing will be reduced 
                            by an amount equal to the difference between the percentage actually used and 70%.  
                       Example: 
                       Consortium with a maximum grant amount of EUR 400 000 (100% reimbursement rate) and 3 reporting 
                       periods. 
                       90% limit of the maximum grant amount: EUR 360 000. 
                       3 Pre-financing payments: EUR 100 000; EUR 120 000 and EUR 140 000. 
                       Statement on the use of previous pre-financing submitted by the Consortium: 70% of the 1st pre-financing and 
                                    nd
                       60% of the 2  pre-financing payment. 
                        nd                                                                                            st
                       2  pre-financing payment of EUR 120 000 is paid in full since the consortium used 70% of the 1  pre-financing; 
                        rd                                                                                                     nd
                       3  pre-financing to the coordinator must be reduced because the consortium used only 60% of the 2  pre-
                       financing;  
                       Pre-financing actually used:  EUR 120 000 * 60% = EUR 72 000 
                                    nd
                       70% of the 2  pre-financing payment: EUR 120 000 * 70% = EUR 84 000 
                       Reduction due to 70% consumption rule:  EUR 84 000 – EUR 72 000 = EUR 12 000  
                        rd
                       3  pre-financing paid to the consortium: EUR 140 000 – EUR 12 000 = EUR 128 000. 
              
             Payment of the balance 
             How much? The amount of the payment of the balance depends on the overall financial situation 
             at the end of the action, and in particular:  
                      the amount of pre-financing(s) already paid (see Article 21 H2020 General MGA) 
                      cost rejections ( improper implementation of the action; see Article 42)  
                      grant reduction (other serious breaches or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud see 
                       Article 43).

                              The beneficiaries have full responsibility for implementing the action and complying with the Agreement.  
                              The  beneficiaries  are  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  the  technical  implementation  of  the  action  as 
                              described in Annex 1. If a beneficiary fails to implement its part of the action, the other beneficiaries 
                              become responsible for implementing this part (without being entitled to any additional EU funding for 
                              doing so), unless the [Commission][Agency] expressly relieves them of this obligation.  
                              The financial responsibility of each beneficiary is governed by Articles 44.

                             issues (see Article 34); 
                          -  any other documents or information required by the [Agency or the] Commission under 
                             the Agreement, unless the Agreement requires the beneficiary to submit this information 
                             directly to the [Agency or the] Commission.

                      (i)   monitor that the action is implemented properly (see Article 7); 
                     (ii)   act  as  the  intermediary  for  all  communications  between  the  beneficiaries  and  the 
                            [Commission][Agency]  (in  particular,  providing  the  [Commission][Agency]  with  the 
                            information described in Article 17), unless the Agreement specifies otherwise;  
                    (iii)   request and review any documents or information required by the [Commission][Agency]  
                            and  verify  their  completeness  and  correctness  before  passing  them  on  to  the 
                            [Commission][Agency];  
                    (iv)    submit the deliverables and the report to the [Commission][Agency] (see Articles 19 and 
                            20);  
                     (v)    ensure that all payments are made to the other beneficiaries without unjustified delay (see 
                            Article 21);  
                    (vi)    inform the [Commission][Agency] of the amounts paid to each beneficiary, when required 
                            under the Agreement (see Articles 44 and 50) or requested by the [Agency][Commission].  
                    The coordinator may not delegate or subcontract the above-mentioned tasks to any other beneficiary 
                    or third party (including linked third parties).

                             The [Commission][Agency]  will — at the payment of the balance or afterwards — reject any costs 
                           which are ineligible (i.e. if the action as described in Annex 1 is not properly implemented; see Article 6), 
                             in particular following checks, reviews, audits or investigations (see Article 22). 
                            
                           The rejection may also be based on the extension of findings from other grants to this grant, (see Article 
                             22.5.2).

                             Ineligible costs will be rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented. 
                            
                           If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery (see Article 44), the [Commission][Agency]  will 
                             formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned of the rejection of costs, the amounts and the 
                           reasons  why  (if  applicable,  together  with  the  notification  of  amounts  due;  see  Article  21.5).  The 
                             coordinator or beneficiary concerned may — within 30 days of receiving notification — formally notify 
                           the [Commission][Agency] of its disagreement and the reasons why.  
                              
                           If the rejection of costs does not lead to a recovery, [Commission][Agency]  will follow the contradictory 
                             procedure with ‘pre-information letter’ set out in Article 44.

                           If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs at the payment of the balance, it will deduct them from the 
                             total  eligible  costs  declared,  for  the  action,  in  the  financial  statement  (see  Article  20.4).  It  will  then 
                           calculate the payment of the balance as set out in Article 21.4. 
                              
                           If the [Commission][Agency] rejects costs after the payment of the balance, it will deduct the amount 
                           rejected from the total eligible costs declared, by the beneficiary, in the financial statement. It will then 
                             calculate the revised final grant amount as set out in Article 5.4.  
                            
                          
                          
                                            
                         1. Rejection of ineligible costs 
                         The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 42 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since for General Lump Sum grants the main cost eligibility condition refers to ‘proper 
                         implementation  of  the  action  in  accordance  with  Annex  1’  (see  Article  6.1),  improper 
                         implementation leads to the ineligibility of the costs (NOT reduction of the grant; see also Article 
                         7). If the action is not carried out as described in Annex 1, the costs will be considered ineligible 
                         and rejected proportionally to the tasks or parts of the action not implemented.  
                                            ‘Rejection of costs’ will be made for improper implementation of the action (see Article 7).

                              43.1              Conditions 
                               
                              The  [Commission][Agency]    may  —  at  the  payment  of  the  balance  or  afterwards  —  reduce  the 
                              maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1), if:  
                                       (a)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                                has committed: 
                          
                                                (i)  substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                          
                                                (ii)  serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure (including 
                                                         submission of false information, failure to provide requested information, breach of ethical 
                                                         principles) or 
                                       (b)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decision on its behalf) 
                                                has  committed  —  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  to  it  under  similar  conditions  — 
                                                systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                                                material impact on this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 
                                                22.5.2). 
                              Improper implementation of the action as described in Annex 1 will not lead to a reduction of the grant but 
                              to a rejection of costs (see Article 42). 
                          
                              43.2              Amount to be reduced — Calculation — Procedure 
                              The amount of the reduction will be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach.  
                              Before reduction of the grant, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ 
                              to the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
                                     -        informing it of its intention to reduce the grant, the amount it intends to reduce and the reasons 
                                              why and 
                                     -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive any observations or decides to pursue reduction despite the 
                              observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the reduction (if applicable, together 
                              with the notification of amounts due; see Article 21). 
                              43.3              Effects  
                              If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant at the time of the payment of the balance, it will calculate 
                              the reduced grant amount for the action and then determine the amount due as payment of the balance (see 
                              Articles 5.3.4 and 21.4). 
                              If the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant after the payment of the balance, it will calculate the 
                              revised final grant amount for the beneficiary concerned (see Article 5.4). If the revised final grant amount 
                              for the beneficiary concerned is lower than its share of the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency] 
                              will recover the difference (see Article 44).

            1. Reduction of the grant  
            The rules on rejection of ineligible costs are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 42 H2020 General MGA). 
            However, since for General Lump Sum grants ‘proper implementation of the action in accordance 
            with Annex 1’ is an eligibility rule and does NOT lead to the reduction of the grant (see also 
            Articles 6.1 and 7), the grant can be reduced only in case of other serious breaches of obligations 
            or substantial errors, irregularities or fraud; see Article 43 H2020 General MGA). 
             
                          Grant  reductions  will  be  made  for  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  and  serious 
                    breaches of obligation other than proper implementation.

                           The [Commission][Agency] will  —at the payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any 
                           amount that was paid, but is not due under the Agreement.

                           44.1.2   Recovery at payment of the balance 
                           If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency]  
                           will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the beneficiary:  
                                      -        informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                                      -        specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                                               Guarantee Fund, and  
                                      -        inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                           If no observations are submitted or the [Commission][Agency]  decides to pursue recovery despite the 
                           observations it has received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see 
                             Article 21.5) and: 
                                    -          pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                                               Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                                    -          formally  notify  to  the  beneficiary  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                                               recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This note 
                                               will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
                           If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, [Agency or the] Commission] will recover the 
                           amount:  
                                      (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the

                                               In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  [Agency  or  the] 
                                               Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                                      (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the 
                                               beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                                                            (i)           [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by

              If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
              increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the payment 
              date in the debit note, up to and including the date [the Agency or] the Commission receives full payment 
              of the amount. 
              Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
              the principal. 
              Bank  charges  incurred  in  the  recovery  process  will  be  borne  by  the  beneficiary,  unless  Directive 
              2007/64/EC applies. 
             
              44.1.3   Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
              If the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the beneficiary must 
              repay the difference to the [Commission][Agency]. 
              The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a pre-information letter to the beneficiary: 
                  -   informing it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and 
                  -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If  no  observations are submitted or the [Commission][Agency] decides to pursue recovery despite the 
              observations  it  has  received,  it  will  confirm  the  amount  to  be  recovered  and  formally  notify  to  the 
              beneficiary a debit note. This note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
              If  payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Agency or the] Commission will 
              recover the amount:  
                  (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                      beneficiary by [the Agency,] the Commission or an[other] executive agency (from the EU or 
                      Euratom budget). 
                      In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  [Agency  or  the] 
                      Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                 (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the 
                     beneficiary the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                            (i)   [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested 
                                  by the [Commission][Agency]: if a linked third party has accepted joint and several 
                                  liability (see Article 14), by holding the third party liable up to the maximum EU 
                                  contribution indicated, for the beneficiary, in the estimated budget (see Annex 2)  
                                  and/or] [OPTION 2: not applicable;] 
                           (ii)   by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision 
                                  under Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a 
                                  of the Euratom Treaty] and Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012. 
              If  payment is not made by the date in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will be 
              increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the date for 
              payment in the debit note, up to and including the date [the Agency or] the Commission receives full 
              payment of the amount. 
              Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against 
              the principal. 
              Bank  charges  incurred  in  the  recovery  process  will  be  borne  by  the  beneficiary,  unless  Directive

                 44.1      Amount to be recovered — Calculation — Procedure 
                 The [Commission][Agency] will —at the payment of the balance or afterwards — claim back any 
                 amount that was paid, but is not due under the Agreement.  
                 44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation 
                 Not applicable 
                 44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance 
                 If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency]  
                 will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the coordinator:  
                      -    informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                      -    specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                           Guarantee Fund, and  
                      -    inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                 If no observations are submitted or the [Commission][Agency]  decides to pursue recovery despite the 
                 observations it has received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see 
                 Article 21.5) and: 
                     -     pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                           Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                     -     formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                           recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This 
                           note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
                 If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission][Agency]  by the date in the debit note, [the Agency or] 
                 the Commission will recover the amount:  
                      (a)  by  offsetting  it  —  without  the  coordinator’s  consent  —    against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                           coordinator by the [Agency, the] Commission or an[other] executive agency (from the EU or 
                           Euratom budget). 
                           In    exceptional      circumstances,       to    safeguard      the    EU’s      financial     interests,    the 
                           [Commission][Agency]  may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note; 
                      (b)  by drawing on the Guarantee Fund. The [Agency or the] Commission will formally notify the 
                           coordinator the debit note on behalf of the Guarantee Fund and recover the amount: 
                              (i)    [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by 
                                      the [Commission][Agency]: if a linked third party to the coordinator has accepted joint 
                                      and  several  liability  (see  Article  14),  by  holding  the  third  party  liable  up  to  the 
                                      maximum EU contribution indicated for the consortium in the estimated budget (see 
                                      Annex 2) and/or][OPTION 2: not applicable;]  
                             (ii)    by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under  
                                      Article 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) and Article 79(2) of the

                 44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance 
                 If the revised final grant amount (see Article 5.4) is lower than the final grant amount, the coordinator must 
                 repay the difference to the [Commission][Agency]. 
                 The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify a pre-information letter to the coordinator: 
                      -    informing it of its intention to recover, the due amount and the reasons why and

                 If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Commission][Agency] will recover the 
                 amount:

            1. Recovery of undue amounts 
            The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 44 H2020 General MGA). 
            The General Lump Sum multi-beneficiary MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
            Since  the  coordinator  alone  is  financially  responsible  (for  the  entire  grant),  the 
            Commission/Agency will recover ONLY from it. 
                Best  practice:  Beneficiaries  should  foresee  internal  arrangements  (e.g.  in  the  consortium 
                agreement) to redistribute the financial responsibility internally in the consortium in a fair way. 
            There is therefore also NO need for a report on the distribution of payments between beneficiaries. 
             
            Specific cases:  
            Coordinator with linked third party with joint and several liability — If a linked third party to the 
            coordinator  has  accepted  joint  and  several  liability  (see  Article  14  H2020  General  MGA),  the 
            Commission/Agency may also recover the amount unduly paid by holding the third party liable — up to 
            the maximum EU contribution indicated for the consortium in the estimated budget (Annex 2).

                           49.1 Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries 
                           49.1.1 Conditions 
                           The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if exceptional circumstances 
                           — in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult. 
                           49.1.2 Procedure 
                           The  coordinator  must  immediately  formally  notify  to  the  [Commission][Agency]  the  suspension  (see 
                            Article 52), stating: 
                                     -        the reasons why and 
                                     -        the expected date of resumption. 
                           The suspension will take effect the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                           Once circumstances allow for implementation to resume, the coordinator must immediately formally notify 
                           the [Commission][Agency] and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which the 
                            action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt the 
                           action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement or the participation of a beneficiary has 
                           been terminated (see Article 50). 
                           The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. 
                           This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
                           49.2 Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency] 
                           49.2.1 Conditions 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if: 
                                     (a)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                              has committed or is suspected of having committed: 
                                                  (i)           substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or 
                                                (ii)            serious  breach  of  obligations  under  the  Agreement  or  during  the  award  procedure 
                                                                (including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, failure 
                                                                to provide requested information, breach of ethical principles); 
                                     (b)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                              has  committed  —  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  to  it  under  similar  conditions  —

                                              22.5.2), or

                           49.2.2 Procedure 
                           Before  suspending  implementation  of  the  action,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  the 
                           coordinator or beneficiary concerned: 
                            
                         Lump sum > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 49                                                                                                                                                                                    805

                  -   informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and 
                  -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
              observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
              formally notify that the procedure is not continued. 
              The suspension will take effect five days after confirmation notification is received (or on a later date 
              specified in the notification). 
              It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met. 
              The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be 
              amended to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make 
              other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement 
              has already been terminated (see Article 50). 
              The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment.  
              This date may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force. 
              The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 
              46). 
              Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission’s][Agency’s] right to terminate 
              the Agreement or participation of a beneficiary (see Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts 
              unduly paid (see Article 43 and Article 44). 
             
                     
            1. GA suspension (consortium or EU) 
            The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 49 H2020 
            General MGA). 
            The General Lump Sum MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
            Suspension of action implementation has NO specific impact on the eligibility of costs. Costs are 
            eligible, if they fulfil the conditions set out in Article 6 — i.e. the action tasks must have been 
            carried out as described in Annex 1.

                           50.1                Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiary  
                          
                             50.1.1   Conditions and procedure 
                          
                             The beneficiary may terminate the Agreement. 
                          
                             The beneficiary must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52), stating: 
                          
                                      -        the reasons why and  
                                      -        the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
                           If no reasons are given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers the reasons do not justify termination, the 
                             Agreement will be considered to have been ‘terminated improperly’. 
                           The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification 
                           50.1.2   Effects 
                           The beneficiary must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
                           Article 20). 
                           If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be 
                             reimbursed. 
                           The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
                           Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
                             under the Agreement.  
                          
                           In case of improper termination, the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43). 
                           After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Section 3 of Chapter 4, Articles 36, 37, 40, 42, 
                             43  and 44) continue to apply.

                           50.3                Termination of the Agreement by the [Commission][Agency]   
                           50.3.1   Conditions 
                           The [Commission][Agency] may terminate the Agreement if: 
                                      (a)  not applicable 
                                      (b)  a change to the beneficiary's legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or 
                                               those of its linked third parties)] is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the 
                                               action or calls into question the decision to award the grant;

                     beneficiary (see Article 49.1) and either: 
                       (i)    resumption is impossible, or 
                       (ii)    the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding 
                              the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; 
                 (e)  the beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, 
                     has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
                     any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law;

                     has been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means; 
                 (g)  the beneficiary does not comply with the applicable national law on taxes and social security;  
                 (h)  the action has lost scientific or technological relevance; 
                 (i)  [OPTION 1 for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation): 
                     the third country or international organisation action (see Article 2) has not started by the date

                 (j) [OPTION 1 for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation): the 
                     third  country or international organisation action (see Article 2) is terminated or can no longer  
                     contribute to the action][OPTION 2: not applicable];   
                 (k)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf)

                 (l)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf)

                           (i)    substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
                           (ii)   serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure ( 
                                  including  improper  implementation of the action, submission of false  information, 
                                  failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles); 
                 (m)  the beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                     has  committed  —  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  to  it  under  similar  conditions  —

                     material impact on this grant (‘extension of findings from other grants to this grant’; see Article 
                     22.5.2). 
                 (n)  [OPTION 1: despite a specific request by the  [Commission][Agency],  a  beneficiary  does  not 
                     request— through the coordinator— an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of

                     (e), (f), (g), (k) and to reallocate its tasks][OPTION 2: not applicable]. 
              50.3.2   Procedure 
              Before terminating the Agreement, the [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the beneficiary:  
                  -  informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and 
                  -  inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and  in case of Point 
                     (l.ii) above — to inform the [Commission][Agency] of the measures to ensure compliance with the 
                     obligations under the Agreement.   
            Lump sum > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50                                                         808

              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
              observations it has received, it will formally notify to the beneficiary confirmation of the termination and 
              the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the procedure is not continued.  
              The termination will take effect: 
                  -   for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j), (l.ii) and  (n)above: on the day specified in 
                      the notification of the confirmation (see above); 
                  -   for  terminations  under  Points  (a),  (d),  (f),  (i),  (k),  (l.i)  and  (m)  above:  on  the  day  after  the 
                      notification of the confirmation is received by the beneficiary. 
              50.3.3  Effects  
              The beneficiary must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —, submit the final report (see 
              Article 20). 
              If  the  Agreement  is  terminated  for  breach  of  the  obligation  to  submit  reports  (see  Articles  20.8  and 
              50.3.1(l)), the beneficiary may not submit any reports after termination. 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be 
              reimbursed 
              The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
              Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
              under the Agreement.  
              This does not affect the [Commission][Agency]’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to impose 
              administrative and sanctions (Article 53).  
              The beneficiary may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 46). 
              After termination, the beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4, 
              36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

              50.1    Termination of the Agreement, by the beneficiaries 
              50.1.1   Conditions and procedure 
              The beneficiaries may terminate the Agreement. 
              The coordinator must formally notify termination to the [Commission][Agency]  (see Article 52), stating: 
                  -   the reasons why and  
                  -   the date the termination will take effect. This date must be after the notification. 
              If no reasons are given or if the [Commission][Agency] considers the reasons do not justify termination, 
              the Agreement will be considered to have been ‘terminated improperly’. 
              The termination will take effect on the day specified in the notification.

              50.1.2 Effects 
              The coordinator must submit — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — the final report (see 
              Article 20). 
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be 
              reimbursed. 
              The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
              Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations 
              under the Agreement.  
             
              In case of improper termination, the grant will be reduced by 100% (see Article 43). 
              After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Section 3 of Chapter 4, Articles 36, 37, 40, 
              42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
              50.2    Termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries, by the beneficiaries 
              50.2.1   Conditions and procedure 
              The participation of one or more beneficiaries may be terminated by the coordinator, on request of the 
              beneficiary concerned or on behalf of the other beneficiaries.  
              The  coordinator  must  formally  notify  termination  to  the  [Commission][Agency]  (see  Article  52)  and 
              inform the beneficiary concerned. 
              If the coordinator’s participation is terminated without its agreement, the formal notification must be done 
              by another beneficiary (acting on behalf of the other beneficiaries). 
              The notification must include: 
                  -   the reasons why;  
                  -   the opinion of the beneficiary concerned (or proof that this opinion has been requested in writing);  
                  -    the date the termination takes effect. This date must be after the notification, and

                      takes effect after the period set out in Article 3, no request for amendment must be included 
                      unless the beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must 
                      propose a new coordinator.

              50.2.2   Effects 
              If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question the 
              decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
              be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
              If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended to 
              introduce the necessary changes (see Article 55). 
              Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43) or termination of the Agreement 
              (see Article 50). 
             
              After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of 
              Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

                    [Commission][Agency]  
             
              50.3.1   Conditions 
              The  [Commission][Agency]  may  terminate  the  Agreement  or  the  participation  of  one  or  more 
              beneficiaries, if: 
                  (a)  one or more beneficiaries do not accede to the Agreement (see Article 56); 
                  (b)  a change to their legal, financial, technical, organisational or ownership situation [(or those of its 
                      linked third parties)] is likely to substantially affect or delay the implementation of the action or 
                      calls into question the decision to award the grant; 
                  (c)  following termination of participation for one or more beneficiaries (see above), the necessary 
                      changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding the grant or breach the 
                      principle of equal treatment of applicants (see Article 55);  
                  (d)  implementation of the action is prevented by force majeure (see Article 51) or suspended by the 
                      coordinator (see Article 49.1) and either: 
                        (i)   resumption is impossible, or 
                       (ii)   the necessary changes to the Agreement would call into question the decision awarding 
                              the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants; 
                  (e)  a beneficiary is declared bankrupt, being wound up, having its affairs administered by the courts, 
                      has entered into an arrangement with creditors, has suspended business activities, or is subject to 
                      any other similar proceedings or procedures under national law; 
                  (f)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf)  
                      has been found guilty of professional misconduct, proven by any means; 
                  (g)  a beneficiary does not comply with the applicable national law on taxes and social security;  
                  (h)  the action has lost scientific or technological relevance; 
                  (i)  [OPTION 1 for joint actions (joint call with a third country or an international organisation): 
                      the third country or international organisation action (see Article 2) has not started by the date

                  (k)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                      has committed fraud, corruption, or is involved in a criminal organisation, money laundering or

                           (i)    substantial errors, irregularities  or fraud or  
                           (ii)   serious breach of obligations under the Agreement or during the award procedure ( 
                                  including improper implementation of the action, submission of false information, 
                                  failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles); 
                  (m)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                      has committed — in other EU or Euratom grants  awarded to it under similar conditions — 
                      systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                      material  impact  on  this  grant  (‘extension  of  findings  from  other  grants  to  this  grant’;  see 
                      Article 22.5.2);  
                  (n)  [OPTION 1: despite a specific request by the [Commission][Agency], a beneficiary does not 
                      request— through the coordinator— an amendment to the Agreement to end the participation of 
                      one of its linked third parties or international partners that is in one of the situations under points 
                      (e), (f), (g), (k) and to reallocate its tasks][OPTION 2: not applicable]. 
              50.3.2   Procedure       
              Before   terminating  the   Agreement  or  participation  of  one  or  more  beneficiaries,  the 
              [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the coordinator or beneficiary concerned:  
                  -   informing it of its intention to terminate and the reasons why and 
                  -  inviting it, within 30 days of receiving notification, to submit observations and  in case of Point 
                     (l.ii) above — to inform the [Commission][Agency] of the measures to ensure compliance with the 
                     obligations under the Agreement.   
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
              observations  it  has  received,  it  will  formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  or  to  beneficiary  concerned 
              confirmation of the termination and the date it will take effect. Otherwise, it will formally notify that the 
              procedure is not continued.  
              The termination will take effect: 
                  -   for terminations under Points (b), (c), (e), (g), (h), (j), (l.ii) and (n) above: on the day specified in 
                      the notification of the confirmation (see above); 
                  -   for  terminations  under  Points  (a),  (d),  (f),  (i),  (k),  (l.i)  and  (m)  above:  on  the  day  after  the 
                      notification of the confirmation is received. 
              50.3.3   Effects  
              (a)  for termination of the Agreement:  
                  The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect —, submit the final report 
                  (see Article 20). 
                  If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see Articles 20.8 and 
                  50.3.1(l)), the coordinator may not submit any reports after termination.  
                  If the Agency does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs will be reimbursed.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                  Lump Sum MGA 
                   The Agency will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see Article 21), on 
                   the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other obligations under the 
                   Agreement.  
                   If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), no costs 
                   will be reimbursed. 
                   The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
                   (see Article 21), on the basis of the report submitted, the eligible costs and compliance with other 
                   obligations under the Agreement.  
                   This does not affect the [Commission][Agency]’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to 
                   impose administrative and sanctions (Article 53).  
                   The beneficiaries  may not  claim damages due to termination by the  [Commission][Agency] (see 
                   Article 46). 
             
                   After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 
                   4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
              (b)  for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries: 
                   The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit a request for 
                   amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks (see Annex 1) and, if 
                   necessary, the addition of one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified 
                   after  the  period  set  out  in  Article  3,  no  request  for  amendment  must  be  submitted  unless  the 
                   beneficiary concerned is the coordinator. In this case the request for amendment must propose a new 
                   coordinator.  
                   If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question 
                   the  decision  awarding  the  grant  or  breaches  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  of  applicants),  the 
                   Agreement may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                   If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended 
                   to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 56). 
                   After termination, the concerned beneficiary’s obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 
                   of Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply. 
               
                     
            1. GA termination (consortium) 
            The rules on GA termination are the same as in the General MGA (see Article 50 H2020 General 
            MGA). 
             
            2. Beneficiary termination (consortium) 
            The rules on beneficiary termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 
            50 H2020 General MGA). 
            However, the General Lump Sum multi-beneficiary MGA has the following specificities: 
            The notification must include a reallocation of the tasks (Annex 1), but NO reallocation of the 
            estimated budget of the beneficiary concerned.  
            Lump sum > Chapter 6 > Section 3 > Article 50                                                         813

            Moreover, if the GA continues (i.e. it is amended), the termination of the beneficiary will NOT have 
            any effect on the estimated budget (since there is a lump sum for the entire action, i.e. the 
            consortium as a whole). 
             
            3. GA or beneficiary termination (EU)  
            The rules on GA and beneficiary termination are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 50 H2020 General MGA). 
            However, the General Lump Sum multi-beneficiary MGA has the following specificities: 
            The request for amendment (which the coordinator must send 60 after termination) must include 
            a  reallocation  of  the  tasks  (Annex  1),  but  NO  reallocation  of  the  estimated  budget  of  the 
            beneficiary concerned.  
            If the GA continues (i.e. it is amended), the termination of the beneficiary will NOT have any effect 
            on the estimated budget (since there is a lump sum for the entire action, i.e. the consortium as a 
            whole).

                         ARTICLE 4 — ESTIMATED LUMP SUM BREAKDOWN AND LUMP SUM SHARE 
                                                                      TRANSFERS  
                            ARTICLE  4  —  ESTIMATED  LUMP  SUM  BREAKDOWN  AND  LUMP  SUM  SHARE 
                                                                          TRANSFERS 
                            4.1               Estimated lump sum breakdown 
                            The ‘estimated lump sum breakdown’ for the action is set out in Annex 2.  
                            It contains the lump sum shares, per work package and beneficiary [and linked third party].  
                            The estimated lump sum breakdown does not prescribe how the EU contribution is to be used by the 
                            beneficiaries.  It  shows  the  amounts  that  the  [Commission][Agency]  commits  to  pay  if  the  action  is 
                            implemented properly, regardless of the costs actually incurred.  
                            4.2               Lump sum share transfers  
                            The estimated lump sum shares indicated in Annex 2 can be adjusted by transfers of amounts between 
                            beneficiaries and/or work packages, via an amendment (see Article 55). 
                            Transfers between work packages are however possible only if:  
                                              -        the work packages are not already completed (and declared in a financial statement);  
                                              -        the transfers are justified by the technical and scientific implementation of the action and 
                                              -        a review in accordance with Article 22.1.2 confirms that the amendment does not call into 
                                                       question  the  decision  awarding  the  grant  or  breach  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  of 
                                                       applicants. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Estimated lump sum breakdown 
                         Since Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use eligible costs, the Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not have any 
                         budget  categories.  Instead,  it  has  a  breakdown  of  the  lump  sum,  per  work  package  and 
                         beneficiary. 
                         The breakdown is used to determine: 
                                          the share of the lump sum to which each beneficiary is entitled for each work package 
                                           Example: Annex 2 sets out EUR 200 000 for work package 1 (WP1). The consortium completed WP1 in the 
                                           first reporting period as described in Annex 1. Therefore, the consortium declares EUR 200 000 for WP1 in 
                                           the periodic reports of period 1. If the Commission confirms that the WP1 was completed as described in 
                                           Annex 1, it will include EUR 200 000 in the periodic payment. 
                                          the  maximum amount for which each beneficiary is liable (grant reduction) in case of 
                                           improper implementation of a work package  
                                           Example: In the example above, the Commission carries out a review on the grant in the last reporting 
                                           period. The review concludes that WP1 was not properly implemented because only part of the activities of 
                                           that work package were actually carried out. The Commission will reduce the grant in proportion to the 
                                           improper implementation of WP1 up to a maximum of EUR 200 000 (the share of the lump sum allocated to 
                                           that work package).  
                                          the  maximum  amount  for  which  each  beneficiary  is  liable  in  case  of  improper 
                                           implementation of a work package.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019              Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
                    Example: In the example above, the Commission carries out a technical audit on the grant after the 
                    payment of the balance. The audit concludes that WP2 (value also EUR 200 000) was not implemented as 
                    indicated in Annex 1. On those grounds, the Commission decides to reduce the grant. Beneficiaries A and B 
                    were together responsible for carrying out WP2 (according to Annex 2 beneficiary A for EUR 150 000 and 
                    beneficiary B for EUR 50 000). Therefore, each beneficiary will be liable for their proportion of the work 
                    package (e.g. in case of a 50% reduction, beneficiary A for EUR 75 000 and Beneficiary B for EUR 25 000). 
             
            2. Lump sum share transfers 
            Unlike in the General MGA, transfers of Lump Sum Pilot shares are only possible via a formal 
            amendment. 
            The transfer may be: 
                  within the same work package (i.e. increasing the share of a beneficiary and decreasing 
                   the share of another) 
                  between  work  packages  (i.e.  increasing  the  share  allocated  to  a  work  package  and 
                   decreasing the share of another). 
            Transfers  between  work  packages  can  only  be  accepted  in  exceptional  circumstances,  if  duly 
            justified and after a project review . 
            Transfers from or to a work package which the consortium has already declared as completed in a 
            reporting period are NOT allowed.

                         Lump sum pilot > Chapter 3 > Article 5 
                         ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT 
                            ARTICLE 5 — GRANT AMOUNT AND FORM OF GRANT  
                            5.1               Maximum grant amount  
                            The ‘maximum grant amount’ is EUR [insert amount (insert amount in words)]. 
                            5.2               Form of grant 
                            The grant takes the form of a lump sum contribution for the implementation of the action. 
                            
                             
                             
                                            
                         1. Grant amount and form of grant  
                         How much & which form? The Lump Sum Pilot MGA does not use the cost forms of the 
                         General MGA, but is a lump sum grant (see Decisions C(2017)7149 and C(2017)7151).  
                                  The use of the lump sum will be set out in the work programme/call.  
                                  The lump sum will be fixed taking into account the H2020 funding rates. This means that the 
                                  lump sum fixed in Article 5 does not have to be multiplied again by the funding rate; it is 
                                  already the net maximum EU funding.  
                                  The lump sum is one amount for the entire consortium.  
                         There are no cost eligibility conditions. If the action is correctly implemented (in line with the 
                         description in Annex 1), the beneficiaries are entitled to receive the fixed lump sum amount. 
                          
                                      The lump sum is deemed to cover ALL (direct and indirect) costs for the action and it can NOT be 
                               increased.

                         EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019                                                                                                                      Lump Sum Pilot MGA

                             5.3               Final grant amount — Calculation 
                             The ‘final grant amount’ depends on the actual extent to which the action is implemented in accordance 
                             with the Agreement’s terms and conditions.  
                             This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] — when the payment of the balance is made (see 
                             Article 21) — in the following steps: 
                                      Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages and reduction of non-
                                                              approved work packages 
                                      Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of obligations  
                             5.3.1                Step  1  —  Calculation  of  the  lump  sum  shares  for  the  approved  work  packages  and 
                                                  reduction of non-approved work packages 
                             The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
                             beneficiaries [and linked third parties] are added together. 
                             The grant is reduced (see Article 43) for all other work packages (i.e. all work packages that have not been 
                             delivered or cannot be approved at the payment of the balance). 
                             5.3.2                Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                                                  obligations — Reduced grant amount — Calculation 
                             If  the  grant  is  further  reduced  (due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                             obligations other than improper implementation; see Article 43), the [Commission][Agency] will calculate 
                             the  reduced  grant  amount  by  deducting  the  amount  of  the  reduction  (calculated  in  proportion  to  the 
                             seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in accordance with Article 43.2) 
                             from the maximum grant amount set out in Article 5.1. 
                             The final grant amount will be the lower of the following two:  
                                                 the amount obtained following Step 1 or  
                                                 the reduced grant amount following Step 2.  
                          
                                            
                         1. Final grant amount 
                         For Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the final grant amount are in principle the same as for the 
                         General MGA (see Article 5.3 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21). 
                         Moreover, since they are lump sum grants (and the amount declared cannot be higher than the 
                         amount fixed in Annex 2 anyways), there is NO need to calculate the: 
                                                    limit to the maximum grant amount or  
                                                    reduction due to the no-profit rule.

                             5.4              Revised final grant amount — Calculation 
                             If  — after the payment of the balance (in particular, after checks, reviews, audits or investigations; see 
                             Article 22) — the [Commission][Agency] reduces the grant (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud 
                             or serious breach of obligations including improper implementation; see Article 43), it will calculate the 
                             ‘revised final grant amount’ for the beneficiary concerned by the findings. 
                             This amount is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] by calculating the concerned beneficiary’s share in 
                             the grant amount reduced in proportion to the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of 
                             obligations (see Article 43.2). 
                            
                                            
                         1. Revised final grant amount 
                         For Lump Sum Pilot grants, the rules on the revised final grant amount are in principle the same 
                         as for the General MGA (see Article 5.4 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are different (see Article 21).

                                                                      INVOLVED IN THE ACTION

                             The beneficiaries must have the appropriate resources to implement the action.  
                             If it is necessary to implement the action, the beneficiaries may:  
                                      -       purchase goods, works and services; 
                                      -       use in-kind contributions provided by third parties against payment; 
                                      -       use in-kind contributions provided by third parties free of charge; 
                                      -       call upon subcontractors to implement action tasks described in Annex 1; 
                                      -       call upon linked third parties to implement action tasks described in Annex 1; 
                                      -       call upon international partners to implement action tasks described in Annex 1  
                             in accordance with the specific rules set out in Article 10 to 14a. 
                             In these cases, the beneficiaries retain sole responsibility towards the [Commission][Agency]  and the other 
                             beneficiaries for implementing the action. 
                            
                              
                                            
                         1. Participants: Appropriate own resources —Third parties involved in the action 
                         The rules of the General MGA on third party involvement are only partly applicable to the Lump 
                         Sum Pilot MGA. 
                         The  General  MGA  rules  on  third  party  involvement  are  limited  in  Lump  Sum  Pilot  actions  to 
                         subcontracting (Article  13),  linked  third  parties  (Article  14)  and  international  partners  (Article 
                         14a). 
                         The articles  for  purchases  (Article  10)  and  in-kind  contributions  (Articles  11  and  12)  are  not 
                         applicable to the Lump Sum Pilot MGA. Beneficiaries may make purchases and use any in-kind 
                         contributions from third parties following their internal practices but not subject to other rules (as 
                         long as they are needed to carry out the work of the action). 
                          
                                      For all types of third party involvement (purchases, in-kind contributions, subcontracts, linked third parties 
                              and international partners), the costs are ALL covered by the lump sum. NO other costs will be reimbursed.

                         ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                            ARTICLE 13 — IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION TASKS BY SUBCONTRACTORS 
                            13.1              Specific rules for subcontracting action tasks 
                            Subcontracting may cover only a limited part of the action. 
                            The tasks to be implemented for each subcontract must be set out in Annex 1. The [Commission][Agency] 
                            may however approve subcontracts not set out in Annex 1 without amendment (see Article 55), if: 
                                     -        they are specifically justified in the periodic technical report and 
                                     -        they do not entail changes to the Agreement which would call into question the decision awarding 
                                              the grant or breach the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
                            [OPTION for classified information: Action tasks involving classified information may be subcontracted 
                            only after explicit approval (in writing) from the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 37).] 
                            The beneficiaries must ensure that [the Agency,] the Commission, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) 
                            and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) can exercise their rights under Articles 22 and 23 also towards 
                            their subcontractors. 
                            The beneficiaries must ensure that their obligations under Articles 35, 36, 38 and 46 also apply to the 
                            subcontractors. 
                            13.2              Consequences of non-compliance 
                            If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).  
                            Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Subcontracting 
                         The rules on subcontracting for Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle the same as for the 
                         General MGA (see Articles 8 and 13 H2020 General MGA). 
                         The Lump Sum Pilot MGA has however the following specificities: 
                         The estimated subcontracting costs do NOT need to be included in Annex 1 or shown in the table 
                         of estimated costs in Annex 2 (there is no such table for the Lump Sum Pilot; Annex 2 is not the 
                         budget, but the estimated lump sum breakdown). By contrast, the tasks to be subcontracted must 
                         still be indicated in Annex 1, as it happens in the General MGA 
                         The principles of best value for money and no conflict of interest are not explicitly mentioned in 
                         Article 13. Nonetheless, they must still be complied with and confirmed by the beneficiaries at 
                         proposal stage.  
                         The obligations in Article 13.1 are NOT considered to be additional cost eligibility conditions, but 
                         ‘other obligations’. In case of breach, the Commission/Agency may therefore reduce the grant in 
                         proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs). 
                         The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations which occurred at proposal stage (see 
                         Article 43 H2020 General MGA).

                             under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43).

                             [OPTION 2: Not applicable]  
                                                                                
                              
                                            
                         1. Financial support to third parties 
                         The rules for financial support to third parties in Lump Sum Pilot actions are in principle the same 
                         as in the General MGA (see Article 15 H2020 General MGA). 
                         Thus, although the minimum conditions for granting financial support are not explicitly listed in 
                         Article 15 of the Lump Sum Pilot MGA, they must still be complied with (and confirmed by the 
                         beneficiaries at proposal stage).  
                         Moreover, like under General MGA, the proposal must fix the criteria that the beneficiaries intend 
                         to apply for their cascading grants (i.e. no more than EUR 60 000 maximum amount per recipient, 
                         the criteria for determining the exact amount of support, the types of activities, the categories of 
                         recipients and the conditions for giving support) and this description will also become part of 
                         Annex 1 of the GA.  
                         The  obligations  in  Article  15.1  and  15.2  are  NOT  considered  to  be  additional  cost  eligibility 
                         conditions,  but  ‘other  obligations’.  In  case  of  breach,  the  Commission/Agency  may  therefore 
                         reduce the grant in proportion to the seriousness of the breach (instead of rejecting the costs).  
                         The grant may also be reduced for breach of obligations at proposal stage (see Article 43 H2020 
                         General                                                                                                                                                                                                                   MGA).

                             They must make them available upon request (see Article 17) or in the context of checks, reviews, audits or 
                             investigations (see Article 22).  
                             If there are on-going checks, reviews, audits, investigations, litigation or other pursuits of claims under the 
                             Agreement (including the extension of findings; see Article 22), the beneficiaries must keep the records and 
                             other supporting documentation until the end of these procedures. 
                             The beneficiaries  must  keep  the  original  documents.  Digital  and  digitalised  documents  are  considered 
                             originals if they are authorised by the applicable national law. The [Commission][Agency] may accept non-
                             original documents if it considers that they offer a comparable level of assurance 
                             Records and other supporting documentation on the scientific and technical implementation of the action 
                             must be in line with the accepted standards in the respective field. 
                             The beneficiaries do not need to keep record about the costs actually incurred for implementing the action.

                             If a beneficiary breaches any of its obligations under this Article, the grant may be reduced (see Article 43). 
                             Such breaches may also lead to any of the other measures described in Chapter 6. 
                            
                                            
                         1. Records and other supporting documentation  
                         For Lump Sum Pilot actions, beneficiaries do not need to keep full records on their actual costs; 
                         they only need to keep appropriate and sufficient evidence (documentation, records) that the 
                         action tasks (as described in Annex 1) were properly carried out.  
                         The evidence must be verifiable, auditable and available. It must be correctly archived — for at 
                         least 5 years after the balance is paid (three years for grants up to EUR 60 000) or longer if there 
                         are ongoing procedures (such as audits, investigations or litigation). In this case, the evidence 
                         must be kept until they end. 
                         The records and supporting documentation must: 
                                          refer to the technical implementation of the action, in line with the accepted standards in 
                                           the respective field (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA) and 
                                            
                                          prove that the tasks or part of the action allocated to the beneficiary in Annex 1 were 
                                           implemented properly (see Article 18 H2020 General MGA).  
                         By contrast, timesheets or invoices for costs actually incurred are NOT needed.  
                                       If the beneficiary cannot provide evidence of the proper implementation of the action, the grant may be 
                                 reduced (and other measures described in Chapter 6 may be applied as well).

            the end of each reporting period (including the final one).

               Each report is composed of a technical and a financial report (like in the General MGA). However, 
               unlike in the General MGA, beneficiaries do not declare costs but their lump sum shares (as set 
               out in Annex 2), for the work packages completed during that reporting period.  
               Work packages can be declared only once fully completed (as described in Annex 1). If a work 
               package is carried  out  by  several  beneficiaries,  they  cannot  declare  it  until  all  of  them  have 
               completed it. 
                    Example: 
                    Grant for a consortium with a maximum grant amount of EUR 3 000 000 and the following breakdown per work

                    Annex 1 of the grant agreement indicates that at the end of the first reporting period WP1, WP2 and WP3 should 
                    have been completed. WP4 and WP5 should have been initiated. 
                    At the end of the first reporting period (RP1) the actual situation is as follows: 
                          
                                                         WP1             WP2              WP3             WP4              WP5 
                                   Beneficiary A      Completed                                         Initiated        Initiated 
                                   Beneficiary B                      Completed        Completed      Not initiated            
                                   Beneficiary C      Completed        Initiated                        Initiated              
                                   Beneficiary D                      Completed                        Completed               
                          
                    Since the beneficiaries can only declare completed work packages, they can only declare the amounts for WP1 
                    and WP3. They cannot declare any amount for the WP2, WP4 or WP5, even if they are initiated, because they 
                    are not completed. 
               Partial work packages are allowed only in the following two situations: 
                        beneficiary termination — terminated beneficiaries may declare (in the termination report) 
                         shares for on-going work packages, provided that their part was completed in accordance 
                         with Annex 1 (see Article 50).  
                        last  reporting  period  —  at  the  end  of  the  action,  beneficiaries  may  exceptionally  also 
                         declare partial shares for work packages that were not completed, for example due to 
                         technical reasons.  
                    Best practice: In case of doubt, the coordinator should contact the Commission/Agency about 
                    partial work packages.

                        The Commission/Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares in the last reporting period if: 
                           the situation could have been solved via an amendment 
                            Example: The consortium argues that they did not have enough time to  complete the WP. The 
                            duration of the action could have been extended via an amendment for the consortium to have enough 
                            time. 
                           non-implementation is linked to financial reasons 
                            Example: The project resulted  to  be more  expensive  than  initially  expected  and  the  consortium 
                            decided to stop the work in some WPs. 
                     
                     
            How? Each periodic report must be prepared by the coordinator and the other beneficiaries 
            together, directly in the Funding & Tenders Portal). 
                     
            In practice, the following steps will apply for the financial part: 
                     
                Step 1 — The coordinator will indicate in the Funding & Tenders Portal which work packages 
                     
                have been fully accomplished during the reporting period.  
                Step 2 — The beneficiaries will have to sign individual financial statements to confirm proper 
                implementation of those work package(s) and submit them to the coordinator. All of them will 
                be part of the financial report for the reporting period concerned.  
                Step 3 — The  coordinator  will  submit  both  the  technical  and  the  financial  report  to  the 
                Commission/Agency.

                               Interim  payments  pay  the  lump  sum  shares  for  work  packages  completed  during  the  corresponding 
                               reporting periods.  
                               The [Commission][Agency] will pay to the coordinator the amount due as interim payment within 90 days 
                               from receiving the periodic report (see Article 20.3), except if Articles 47 or 48 apply. 
                               Payment is subject to the approval of the periodic report and the lump sum shares and work packages 
                               declared.  Their  approval  does  not  imply  recognition  of  the  compliance,  authenticity,  completeness  or 
                               correctness of their content.  
                               Work packages that have not been completed in time or cannot be approved at the time of an interim 
                               payment may be submitted (again) for the next reporting period (or any other future reporting period, after 
                               they have been completed). 
                               The amount due as interim payment is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] in the following steps: 
                                       Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages 
                                       Step 2 — Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount  
                               21.3.1 Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages  
                               The amounts of the lump sum shares (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the 
                               beneficiaries [and linked third parties] for the concerned reporting period are added together. 
                               21.3.2 Step 2 — Limit to 90% of the maximum grant amount 
                               The total amount of pre-financing and interim payments must not exceed 90% of the maximum grant 
                               amount set out in Article 5.1. The maximum amount for the interim payment will be calculated as follows:  
                                                {90% of the maximum grant amount (see Article 5.1)  
                                                minus 
                                                {pre-financing and previous interim payments}}.

                               The payment of the balance reimburses the remaining lump sum shares for the implementation of the 
                               action. 
                               If  the  total  amount  of  earlier  payments  is  greater  than  the  final  grant  amount  (see  Article  5.3),  the 
                               payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 44).  
                               If the total amount of earlier payments is lower than the final grant amount, the [Commission][Agency] 
                               will pay the balance within 90 days from receiving the final report (see Article 20.4), except if Articles 47

              Payment is subject  to  the  approval  of  the  final  report  and  the  lump  sum  shares  and  work  packages 
              declared. Their approval does not imply recognition of the compliance, authenticity, completeness or 
              correctness of their content. 
              Incomplete work packages and work packages that have not been delivered or cannot be approved at the 
              payment of the balance will reduce the grant (see Articles 5 and 43).  
              The amount due as the balance is calculated by the [Commission][Agency] by deducting the total 
              amount  of  pre-financing  and  interim  payments  (if  any)  already  made,  from  the  final  grant  amount 
              determined in accordance with Article 5.3: 
                      {final grant amount (see Article 5.3) 
                      minus 
                      {pre-financing and interim payments (if any) made}}. 
              At the payment of the balance, the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see above) will be released 
              and: 
                      -   if the balance is positive: the amount released will be paid in full to the coordinator together 
                          with the amount due as the balance;  
                      -   if the balance is negative (payment of the balance taking the form of recovery): it will be 
                          deducted from the amount released (see Article 44.1.2). If the resulting amount: 
                          -   is positive, it will be paid to the coordinator 
                          -   is negative, it will be recovered.  
              The amount to be paid may however be offset — without the beneficiaries’ consent —  against any other 
              amount owed by a beneficiary to the [Agency, the] Commission or an[other] executive agency (under the 
              EU or Euratom budget), up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for that beneficiary, in the estimated 
              lump sum breakdown (see Annex 2).

            1. Payments to be made  
            The  rules  on  payments  are  in  principle  the  same  as  in  the  General  MGA  (one  pre-financing 
            payment, interim payments at the end of each reporting period, and a final payment of the 
            balance).  
             
            2. Payment calculations — Amounts due — Recoveries?  
            Interim payments 
            How much? The amount of the interim payments will be calculated by the Commission/Agency 
            on the basis of the financial statements and the payments already made. 
            The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Article 21.3 H2020 General MGA), however with 
            the following specificities: 
            Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21                                                   830

               Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
               eligible costs, but simply sums up the lump sum shares for the accepted work packages for this 
               reporting period (the lump sum shares in Annex 2 already take into account the reimbursement 
               rate; no need to apply it again). Partial work packages will NOT be accepted; the entire work 
               package (i.e. work of all beneficiaries) needs to be done. 
                
               Beneficiary termination 
               How  much?  The  amount  due  at  beneficiary  termination  will  be  calculated  by  the 
               Commission/Agency on the basis of the termination report, the payments already made and the 
               report on the distribution of payments. 
               The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 21.3, 44.1.1, 50.2.2 and 50.3.3 H2020 
               General MGA), however with the following specificities: 
               Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
               eligible costs, but simply sums up all the lump sum shares for the beneficiary’s accepted work 
               packages.  Partial  work  packages  can  be  accepted  (i.e.  shares  for  work  packages  where  the 
               beneficiary's part is completed ). 
               Exceptionally, the Commission/Agency may accept also part of a lump sum share for a work 
               package in which the beneficiary has not carried out all its tasks.  
                    Example: The beneficiary requests terminating its participation in the action because a fire devastated its 
                    laboratory where most of the technical equipment and computers used for the action were located. Therefore, 
                    the beneficiary cannot complete its tasks in the on-going work packages due to force majeure (see Article 51 
                    H2020 General MGA). On those grounds, the Commission decides to accept for that beneficiary a part of the 
                    lump sum shares for the on-going work packages proportionate to the tasks carried out by the beneficiary in 
                    those work packages. 
               Not completed work packages (or not completed parts of them) can be finished and declared later 
               on. 
                
               Example for calculating the amount due at beneficiary termination: 
               Grant with four beneficiaries (A, B, C, D). 
               Maximum grant amount: EUR 3 000 000.

               The participation of beneficiary B is terminated before the end of the first reporting period. At the time when the 
               termination takes effect beneficiary B had fully completed its tasks for WP2 and WP3 and initiated its tasks for WP4. 
               The coordinator had transferred EUR 650 000 as pre-financing to beneficiary B. 
               Amount due: 
               Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP2 + WP3 = EUR 600 000.

               Beneficiary B balance: EUR 600 000 (amount due) - EUR 650 000 (payments received) = EUR -50 000 (excess 
               payments of EUR 50 000). 
               Recovery: 
               Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 50 000 (negative balance of EUR 50 000 must be returned to the 
               consortium; otherwise Commission/Agency will start a recovery procedure). 
                
               Payment of the balance 
               How much? The amount to be paid (or recovered) at payment of the balance (final payment) will 
               be calculated by the Commission/Agency on the basis of the financial statements, the final grant 
               amount, the payments already made and the report on the distribution of payments 
               The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.3, 21.4 and 44.1.2 H2020 General MGA), 
               however with the following specificities: 
               Step 1 (Calculation of the accepted EU contribution) does not apply the reimbursement rate to the 
               eligible costs but simply sums up all the lump sum shares for the accepted work packages. Partial 
               work  packages  can  exceptionally  be  accepted  (i.e.  shares  for  work  packages  that  were  not 
               completed, for example due to technical reasons). 
                                The Commission/Agency will NOT accept partial lump sum shares in the last reporting period if: 
                                    the situation could have been solved via an amendment 
                                     Example: The consortium argues that they did not have enough time to complete the WP. The 
                                     duration of the action could have been extended via an amendment for the consortium to have 
                                     enough time. 
                                    non-implementation is linked to financial reasons 
                                     Example: The project resulted to be more expensive than initially expected and the consortium 
                                     decided to stop the work in some WPs. 
                            
                            
               Steps 2 (Limit to the maximum grant amount) and 3 (Calculation of receipts & deduction of profit) 
               do not apply to Lump Sum Pilot grants. 
                                . 
               Step 4 (Grant reductions) relates to grant reductions for breaches other than non-implementation 
                                 
               (because non-implementation is already taken into account for Step 1).  
                            
               All other steps follow the General MGA. 
                            
                            
               Example for calculating the payment of the balance:

               Case 1: 
               At the end of the action, WP7 was not completed as described in Annex 1. The Commission decides to reduce 50 % 
               of WP7, corresponding to the proportion of the undelivered part of that work package. All other work packages were 
               completed as described in Annex 1. In addition, the consortium breached an important confidentiality obligation 
               under Article 36. The Commission decides to reduce the maximum grant amount by 10 % for that reason. 
               Final grant amount: 
               Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP1 + WP2 + WP3 + WP4 + WP5 + WP6 + 50 % WP7 + WP8 = EUR 
               2 900 000. 
               Amount resulting from Step 1: EUR 2 900 000. 
               Grant  reduction  for  other  breaches:  10%  grant  reduction  for  the  action  =  maximum  grant  amount  –  10  % 
               (reduction) = 3 000 000 – 300 000 = EUR 2 700 000. 
               Amount resulting from Step 2: EUR 2 700 000. 
               Lower amount of the two:  EUR 2 700 000. 
               Final grant amount: = EUR 2 700 000. 
                
               Case 2: 
               The consortium decides to terminate the GA due to technical difficulties that result in the action no longer being 
               viable. The termination takes effect before the end of the first reporting period. At the moment of termination the 
               state of play of each work package is as follows: 
                
                                               WP1             WP2              WP3             WP4              WP5          WP6, WP7, WP8 
                         Beneficiary A     Completed                                          Initiated        Initiated        Not initiated 
                         Beneficiary B                     Completed        Completed       Not initiated                       Not initiated 
                         Beneficiary C     Completed       Not initiated                    Not initiated                       Not initiated 
                         Beneficiary D                     Completed                        Completed                           Not initiated 
                
               In  the  reports,  the  consortium  justifies  that  for  WP2  the  work  of  beneficiary  B  and  beneficiary  D  were  fully 
               accomplished in accordance with Annex 1, that the work of beneficiary C in this work package was ancillary and that 
               beneficiary C stopped in fact collaborating in the action. On those grounds, the Commission accepts exceptionally 
               370 000 EUR for WP2. 
               Final grant amount: 
               Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP1 + WP2 (part) + WP3 = 350 000 + 370 000 + 350 000 = EUR 1 
               070 000 
               No grant reductions for other breaches.  
               Final grant amount: EUR 1 070 000.  
                
               Case 3: 
               Work package 2 was not carried out (i.e. representing a total lump sum share of EUR 470 000) and therefore the 
               Commission reduced the grant accordingly.  
               Final grant amount: 
               Lump sum shares for accepted work packages: WP1 + WP3 + WP4 + WP5 + WP6 + WP7 + WP8 = EUR 2 530 000. 
               No grant reductions for other breaches. 
               Final grant amount: EUR 2 530 000 ( beneficiary shares: A = EUR 1 150 000; B = EUR 650 000; C = EUR 430 000; 
               D = EUR 300 000). 
               Balance & Guarantee Fund release: 
               Payments made: EUR 2 700 000.  
               Balance: EUR 2 530 000 (final grant amount) - EUR 2 700 000 (payments made) = EUR -170 000 (excess payments 
               of EUR 170 000). 
               Offsetting against Guarantee Fund release: EUR 170 000  - EUR 150 000 = EUR 20 000 
               Recovery: 
               Amount to be recovered from the consortium: EUR 20 000 (negative balance of EUR 20 000 must be paid back by 
               coordinator, otherwise Commission will start a recovery procedure against the beneficiaries that received excess 
               funding). 
               Recovery from coordinator: 
               The coordinator does not reimburse the Commission and sends the report on the distribution of the payments among 
               beneficiaries (distribution: A= EUR 977 500; B= EUR 765 000; C = EUR 450 500; D= EUR 357 000).

                  grant)} -  EUR 357 000 (payments received) = EUR -57 000 (excess payment of EUR 57 000). 
                  Beneficiaries B, C and D received payments in excess of their EU contribution and will have to reimburse the 
                  Commission. 
                  Beneficiary A will have to recover the money owed to it (if any) from the other beneficiaries in the consortium.

                  D: 57 000/192 500 = 29.61 %. 
             Total to be recovered: EUR 20 000.  
                  B: 59.74 % x 20 000 = EUR 11 948

             Audit implementation after payment of the balance — Revised final grant amount 
             The  amount  to  be  recovered  (or  paid)  after  the  final  payment  will  be  calculated  by  the 
             Commission/Agency on the basis of the final grant amount and the revised final grant amount. 
             The rules follow those of the General MGA (see Articles 5.4 and 44.1.3 H2020 General MGA), 
             however with the following specificities: 
             Step  1  (Re-calculation  of  the  accepted  EU  contribution)  does  not  apply;  only  Step  2  (Grant 
             reductions) applies.

             Final grant amount: EUR 1 150 000 + EUR 900 000 + EUR 530 000 + EUR 420 000 = EUR 3 000 000. 
             Lump sum pilot > Chapter 4 > Section 2 > Article 21                                                                  834 
            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019              Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
            The Commission carries out a technical audit on the action and finds out that beneficiary B did not carry out its 
            activities under the work package 4 (lump sum share EUR 50 000). The Commission therefore reduces the grant by 
            EUR 50 000. 
            Beneficiary revised final grant amount: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary B: EUR 900 000 (accepted lump sum shares) — EUR 
            50 000 (rejected lump sum shares) = EUR 850 000 
            Beneficiary B revised final grant amount: EUR 850 000. 
            The other beneficiaries final grant amounts (i.e. their final grant amount shares) remain unchanged. 
             
            Beneficiary balance: 
            The share of beneficiary B in the final grant amount = EUR 900 000 / 3 000 000 x 3 000 000 = EUR 900 000. 
            Balance: EUR 850 000 (revised final grant amount) – EUR 900 000 (final grant share) = EUR -50 000 (excess of EUR 
            50 000). 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 50 000 (negative balance of EUR 50 000 must be paid back by the 
            beneficiary). 
             
            Case 2: 
            Same example as above, but in this case a reduction of the maximum grant amount had been performed at the time 
            of the payment of the balance as follows: the consortium breached a confidentiality obligation under Article 36 and 
            the Commission reduced the maximum grant amount by 10 % for that reason (i.e. EUR 3 000 000 – 10 % = EUR 2 
            700 000). 
            Final grant amount: 
            Final grant amount: = EUR 2 700 000. 
            Beneficiary revised final grant amount: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for beneficiary B: EUR 900 000 (accepted lump sum shares) — EUR 
            50 000 (rejected lump sum shares) = EUR 850 000. 
            Beneficiary B revised final grant amount: EUR 850 000. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            The share of beneficiary B in the final grant amount = EUR 900 000 / EUR 3 000 000 x EUR 2 700 000 = EUR 
            810 000. 
            Balance: EUR 850 000 (revised final grant amount) – EUR 810 000 (final grant share) = EUR 40 000 (no excess). 
            Recovery: 
            No recovery. 
             
            Case 3:  
            Final grant amount: 
            Final grant amount: EUR 1 150 000 + EUR 900 000 + EUR 530 000 + EUR 420 000 = EUR 3 000 000. 
            The Commission carries out a technical audit on the action and finds out that work package 8 (EUR 600 000) has not 
            been implemented as described in Annex 1 and decides to reject it.  
            Beneficiary revised final grant amount: 
            Re-calculation of accepted EU contribution for the consortium & revised final grant amount: 
                Beneficiary A: 1 150 000 – 300 000 = EUR 850 000. 
                Beneficiary B: 900 000 – 150 000= EUR 750 000. 
                Beneficiary D: 420 000 - 150 000= EUR 270 000. 
            The EU contributions of beneficiary C remain unchanged. 
            Beneficiary balance: 
            The share of beneficiary A in the final grant amount = EUR 1 150 000. 
            The share of beneficiary B in the final grant amount = EUR 900 000.  
            The share of beneficiary D in the final grant amount = EUR 420 000. 
            Balance:  
                A: EUR 850 000 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 1 150 000 (final grant share) = EUR -300 000. 
                B: EUR 750 000 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 900 000 (final grant share) = EUR -150 000. 
                D: EUR 270 000 (revised final grant amount) - EUR 420 000 (final grant share) = EUR -150 000. 
            Recovery: 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary A: EUR 300 000 (negative balance of EUR 300 000 must be paid back by 
            the beneficiary). 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary B: EUR 150 000 (negative balance of EUR 150 000 must be paid back by 
            the beneficiary). 
            Amount to be recovered from beneficiary D: EUR 150 000 (negative balance of EUR 150 000 must be paid back by 
            the beneficiary).

                               18         Regulation  (EU,  Euratom)  No  883/2013  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  11  September  2013  concerning 
                                          investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European 
                                          Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (OJ L 248, 18.09.2013, p. 1). 
                                            
                         1. Checks, reviews and audits 
                         The rules on checks, reviews and audits are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
                         Article 22 H2020 General MGA). 
                         However, since Lump Sum Pilot grants do not use eligible costs, their scope will differ as follows:  
                                         there will be no financial checks, reviews, or audits to check costs (since beneficiaries have 
                                          no obligation to document the costs incurred for the action, even if they remain subject to 
                                          the accounting rules under the applicable national law).  
                                         checks, reviews, and audits will focus on the technical implementation of the action (in 
                                          particular full accomplishment of the work packages as described in Annex 1 of the GA), or 
                                          on other aspects of the grant agreement, such as promoting the action, visibility of EU 
                                          funding,  ethics  and  research  integrity,  dissemination  and  exploitation  of  results, 
                                          management of intellectual property, etc. 
                         Specific cases (audits): 
                         Audits for periodical assessment of simplified cost forms — The Commission/Agency may also 
                         audit the accounting records of beneficiaries to obtain general information about real costs of cost items 
                         for which it has fixed unit costs, flat-rate or lump sums (for statistical purposes or to gather data to 
                         assess the adequacy of its unit cost, flat rate or lump sum). Such audits have no consequences for the 
                         beneficiaries that were audited.

                               44.1              Amount to be recovered — Calculation — Procedure 
                               The [Commission][Agency] will — after termination of a beneficiary’s participation, at the payment 
                               of  the  balance  or  afterwards  —  claim  back  any  amount  that  was  paid,  but  is  not  due  under  the 
                               Agreement. 
                               Each beneficiary’s financial responsibility in case of recovery is limited to its own debt [OPTION if 
                               Article 14 applies: (including undue amounts paid by the [Commission][Agency] for lump sum shares 
                               declared by its linked third parties)], except for the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund (see Article 
                               21.4). 
                               44.1.1 Recovery after termination of a beneficiary’s participation 
                               If recovery takes place after termination of a beneficiary’s participation (including the coordinator), the 
                               [Commission][Agency] will claim back the undue amount from the beneficiary concerned, by formally 
                               notifying it a debit note (see Article 50.2 and  50.3). This note will specify the amount to be recovered, the 
                               terms and the date for payment. 
                               If  payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the [Agency or the] Commission will 
                               recover the amount:  
                                        (d)  by  ‘offsetting’  it  —  without  the  beneficiary’s  consent  —  against  any  amounts  owed  to  the 
                                                 beneficiary concerned by the [Agency, the] Commission or an[other] executive agency (from the 
                                                 EU or Euratom budget).  
                                                 In  exceptional  circumstances,  to  safeguard  the  EU’s  financial  interests,  the  [Agency  or  the] 
                                                 Commission may offset before the payment date specified in the debit note;  
                                        (e)  [OPTION 1 if Article 14 applies and joint and several liability has been requested by the 
                                                 [Commission][Agency]: if a linked third party has accepted joint and several liability (see Article 
                                                 14), by holding the third party liable up to the maximum grant amount indicated, for the linked 
                                                 third  party,  in  the  estimated  lump  sum  breakdown  (see  Annex  2)  and/or][OPTION  2:  not 
                                                 applicable;]  
                                        (f)  by taking legal action (see Article 57) or by adopting an enforceable decision under Article 
                                                 299 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) [, Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty] 
                                                 and Article 79(2) of the Financial Regulation No 966/2012.  
                               If payment is not made by the date specified in the debit note, the amount to be recovered (see above) will 
                               be increased by late-payment interest at the rate set out in Article 21.11, from the day following the 
                               payment date in the debit note, up to and including the date the [Agency or the] Commission receives full 
                               payment of the amount. 
                               Partial payments will be first credited against expenses, charges and late-payment interest and then against

              44.1.2 Recovery at payment of the balance 
              If the payment of the balance takes the form of a recovery (see Article 21.4), the [Commission][Agency] 
              will formally notify a ‘pre-information letter’ to the coordinator:  
                  -   informing it of its intention to recover, the amount due as the balance and the reasons why;  
                  -   specifying that it intends to deduct the amount to be recovered from the amount retained for the 
                      Guarantee Fund;  
                  -   requesting the coordinator to submit a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiaries 
                      within 30 days of receiving notification, and 
                  -   inviting the coordinator to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
              If  no  observations are submitted or the [Commission][Agency] decides to pursue recovery despite the 
              observations it has received, it will confirm recovery (together with the notification of amounts due; see 
              Article 21.5) and: 
                  -   pay the difference between the amount to be recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee 
                      Fund, if the difference is positive or 
                  -   formally  notify  to  the  coordinator  a  debit  note  for  the  difference  between  the  amount  to  be 
                      recovered and the amount retained for the Guarantee Fund, if the difference is negative. This 
                      note will also specify the terms and the date for payment.  
              If the coordinator does not repay the [Commission][Agency] by the date in the debit note and has not 
              submitted the report on the distribution of payments: the [Agency or the] Commission will recover the 
              amount set out in the debit note from the coordinator (see below). 
              If  the  coordinator  does  not  repay  the  [Commission][Agency]  by  the  date  in  the  debit  note,  but  has 
              submitted the report on the distribution of payments, the [Commission][Agency] will: 
                   (c) identify the beneficiaries for which the amount calculated as follows is negative: 
                          {{{{beneficiary’s approved lump sum shares  
                          [plus 
                          its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares]}, 
                          divided by 
                          the  total  of  all  beneficiaries’  [and  linked  third  parties’]  lump  sum  shares  for  approved  work  packages 
                          calculated according to Article 5.3.1} 
                          multiplied by  
                          the final grant amount (see Article 5.3)}, 
                          minus 
                          {pre-financing and interim payments received by the beneficiary}}. 
                   (d) formally notify to each beneficiary identified according to point (a) a debit note specifying the 
                       terms and date for payment. The amount of the debit note is calculated as follows:  
                       {{amount calculated according to point (a) for the beneficiary concerned 
                       divided by 
                       the sum of the amounts calculated according to point (a) for all the beneficiaries identified according to point (a)} 
                       multiplied by  
                       the amount set out in the debit note formally notified to the coordinator}.

              44.1.3 Recovery of amounts after payment of the balance  
              If, for a beneficiary, the revised final grant amount (see Article 5) is lower than its share of the final grant 
              amount, it must repay the difference to the [Commission][Agency]. 
              The beneficiary's share of the final grant amount is calculated as follows: 
                  {beneficiary’s approved lump sum shares  
                  [plus 
                  its linked third parties’ approved lump sum shares]} 
                  divided by 
                  the  total  of  all  beneficiaries’  [and  linked  third  parties’]  lump  sum  shares  for  approved  work  packages  calculated 
                  according to Article 5.3.1} 
                  multiplied by  
                  the final grant amount (see Article 5.3)}.

            1. Recovery of undue amounts 
            The rules on recovery of undue amounts are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see 
            Article 44 H2020 General MGA).  
            However, since for Lump Sum Pilot grants there is no reporting of costs, the calculations are 
            different (see Article 21).

                              ARTICLE 47 — SUSPENSION OF PAYMENT DEADLINE   
                              47.1 Conditions  
                              The [Commission][Agency]  may — at any moment — suspend the payment deadline (see Article 21.2 to 
                              21.4) if a request for payment (see Article 20) cannot be approved because:   
                                      (a)  it does not comply with the provisions of the Agreement (see Article 20);   
                                      (b)  the  technical  or  financial  report  has  not  been  submitted  or  is  not  complete  or  additional 
                                               information is needed, or  
                                      (c)  there is doubt about amounts requested for payment (including the need for a grant reduction) and 
                                               additional checks, reviews, audits or investigations are necessary.  
                              47.2 Procedure  
                              The [Commission][Agency] will formally notify the coordinator of the suspension and the reasons why.   
                              The suspension will take effect the day notification is sent by the [Commission][Agency] (see Article 52).   
                              If the conditions for suspending the payment deadline are no longer met, the suspension will be lifted — 
                              and the remaining period will resume.  
                              If  the  suspension exceeds two months, the coordinator may request the [Commission][Agency]  if the 
                              suspension will continue.   
                              If the payment deadline has been suspended due to the non-compliance of the technical or financial report 
                              (see Article 20) and the revised report or statement is not submitted or was submitted but is also rejected, 
                              the [Commission][Agency]  may also terminate the Agreement or the participation of the beneficiary (see 
                              Article 50.3.1(l)). 
                          
                                            
                         1. Suspension of the payment deadline (EU) 
                         The rules on the suspension of the payment deadline are in principle the same as in the General 
                         MGA (see Article 47 H2020 General MGA).  
                         The Lump Sum Pilot MGA has, however, the following specificities: 
                         Since there are no cost eligibility conditions about which there could be doubts, the suspension 
                         ground for Lump Sum Pilot grants targets more generally any kinds of doubts about the amounts 
                         requested for payment (including doubts linked to work package implementation).

                             ARTICLE 49 — SUSPENSION OF THE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION  
                             49.1              Suspension of the action implementation, by the beneficiaries 
                             49.1.1   Conditions  
                             The beneficiaries may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it if exceptional circumstances 
                             — in particular force majeure (see Article 51) — make implementation impossible or excessively difficult.  
                             49.1.2   Procedure 
                             The  coordinator  must  immediately  formally  notify  to  the  [Commission][Agency]  the  suspension  (see 
                             Article 52), stating: 
                                      -        the reasons why and  
                                      -        the expected date of resumption. 
                             The suspension will take effect the day this notification is received by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                             Once circumstances  allow  for  implementation  to  resume,  the  coordinator  must  immediately  formally 
                             notify the [Commission][Agency]  and request an amendment of the Agreement to set the date on which 
                             the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make other changes necessary to adapt 
                             the  action  to  the  new  situation  (see  Article  55)  —  unless  the  Agreement  or  the  participation  of  a 
                             beneficiary has been terminated (see Article 50). 
                             The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date 
                             may be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
                             During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
                             work packages may be started.  
                             49.2              Suspension of the action implementation, by the [Commission][Agency] 
                             49.2.1   Conditions 
                             The [Commission][Agency] may suspend implementation of the action or any part of it, if: 
                                      (a)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                               has committed or is suspected of having committed: 
                                                   (i)          substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or  
                                                 (ii)           serious  breach  of  obligations  under  the  Agreement  or  during  the  award  procedure 
                                                                (including  improper  implementation  of  the  action,  submission  of  false  information, 
                                                                failure to provide required information, breach of ethical principles);  
                                      (b)  a beneficiary (or a natural person who has the power to represent or take decisions on its behalf) 
                                               has  committed  —  in  other  EU  or  Euratom  grants  awarded  to  it  under  similar  conditions  — 
                                               systemic  or  recurrent  errors,  irregularities,  fraud  or  serious  breach  of  obligations  that  have  a 
                                               material impact on this grant (extension of findings from other grants to this grant; see Article 
                                               22.5.2), or  
                                      (c)  the action is suspected of having lost its scientific or technological relevance.

            EU Grants: H2020 AGA — Annotated Model Grant Agreement: V5.2 – 26.06.2019              Lump Sum Pilot MGA 
              49.2.2   Procedure 
               
              Before  suspending  implementation  of  the  action,  the  [Commission][Agency]  will  formally  notify  the 
              coordinator or beneficiary concerned: 
                       
                  -   informing it of its intention to suspend the implementation and the reasons why and  
                       
                  -   inviting it to submit observations within 30 days of receiving notification.  
                       
              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive observations or decides to pursue the procedure despite the 
              observations it has received, it will formally notify confirmation of the suspension. Otherwise, it will 
              formally notify that the procedure is not continued.  
               
              The suspension will take effect five days after confirmation notification is received (or on a later date 
              specified in the notification). 
               
              It will be lifted if the conditions for resuming implementation of the action are met.  
               
              The coordinator or beneficiary concerned will be formally notified of the lifting and the Agreement will be 
              amended to set the date on which the action will be resumed, extend the duration of the action and make 
              other changes necessary to adapt the action to the new situation (see Article 55) — unless the Agreement 
              has already been terminated (see Article 50). 
               
              The suspension will be lifted with effect from the resumption date set out in the amendment. This date may 
              be before the date on which the amendment enters into force.  
               
              During the suspension, no work may be done. Ongoing work packages must be interrupted and no new 
              work packages may be started.  
               
              The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to suspension by the [Commission] [Agency] (see Article 
              46). 
               
              Suspension of the action implementation does not affect the [Commission][Agency]'s right to terminate the 
              Agreement or participation of a beneficiary (see Article 50), reduce the grant or recover amounts unduly 
              paid (see Articles 43 and 44). 
                     
            1. GA suspension (consortium or EU) 
            The rules on GA suspension are in principle the same as in the General MGA (see Article 49 H2020 
            General MGA).  
            For  full  GA  suspension  (action  is  entirely  suspended),  all  on-going  work  packages  must  be 
            interrupted and NO new work packages may be started.  
            For partial GA suspensions other work packages may be continued and new work packages may 
            be started(except for those covered by the suspension).  
            However, partial suspensions may have an indirect effect on other work packages, in the sense 
            that it might not be possible to fully complete them (and thus not be possible to declare them for 
            the reporting period — unless it is already the end of the action; see Articles 20 and 21).  
            Example: A fire caused some damage to an equipment of a beneficiary which is used for a set of chemical 3D-
            analyses (large part of WP2) which are then needed for further experiments in WP4 and WP5. The consortium 
            therefore requests that the part of the action that is affected (WP3) is suspended until the equipment is restored. 
            The other beneficiaries may continue to work on the other work packages (WP4 and WP5). However, if these work 
            packages cannot be fully completed at the end of the reporting period because the WP3 continues to be suspended, 
            the lump sum shares for WP4 and WP5 cannot be declared by the beneficiaries.

                              The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                                           (i)  a periodic report (for the open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) and 
                                         (ii)  the final report (see Article 20.4). 
                              If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), only lump sum 
                              shares included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
                              The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance (see 
                              Article  21.4),  on  the  basis  of  the  reports  submitted  and  compliance  with  other  obligations  under  the 
                              Agreement. Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed before termination will be accepted 
                              — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                              Improper termination may lead to a reduction of the grant (see Article 43).  
                              After termination, the beneficiaries’ obligations (in particular Articles 20, 22, 23, Section 3 of Chapter 4,

                              The coordinator must — within 30 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                                         (i) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned and 
                                       (ii) if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a ‘termination report’ from the 
                                                   beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an overview of 
                                                   the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20.3 and 20.4).  
                              The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next reporting 
                              period (see Article 20.3). 
                              If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question the 
                              decision awarding the grant or breaches the principle of equal treatment of applicants), the Agreement may 
                              be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                              If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended to 
                              introduce the necessary changes (see Article 55). 
                              The [Commission][Agency] will  — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
                              report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if the 
                              payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amount. 
                                       The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps:

                       Step 1 —  Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work packages  
                                   The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by adding the lump sum shares 
                                   (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the beneficiary [and its 
                                   linked third parties] in the termination report. 
                                   Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed by the beneficiary before 
                                   termination  will  be  approved  —  unless  exceptionally  agreed  otherwise  by  the 
                                   [Commission][Agency]. 
                       Step  2  —  Reduction  due  to  substantial  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  serious  breach  of 
                                   obligations 
                                   If the grant is reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
                                   breach of obligations other than non-implementation of the action; see Article 43), 
                                   the  [Commission][Agency]  will  calculate  the  reduced  grant  amount  for  the 
                                   beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to the 
                                   seriousness  of  the  errors,  irregularities  or  fraud  or  breach  of  obligations,  in 
                                   accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary. 
                       The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.

               50.3.3  Effects  
               (b)  for termination of the Agreement:  
                   The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                         (i)   a periodic report (for the last open reporting period until termination; see Article 20.3) 
                               and 
                        (ii)   a final report (see Article 20.4). 
                   If the Agreement is terminated for breach of the obligation to submit reports (see Articles 20.8 and 
                   50.3.1(l)), the coordinator may not submit any reports after termination. 
                   If the [Commission][Agency] does not receive the report within the deadline (see above), only lump 
                   sum shares included in an approved periodic report will be taken into account. 
                   The [Commission][Agency] will calculate the final grant amount (see Article 5.3) and the balance 
                   (see Article 21.4), on the basis of the reports submitted and compliance with other obligations under 
                   the Agreement. Only lump sum shares for work packages fully completed before termination will be 
                   accepted — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by the [Commission][Agency]. 
                   This does not affect the [Commission][Agency]’s right to reduce the grant (see Article 43) or to 
                   impose administrative sanctions (Article 45).  
                   The beneficiaries may not claim damages due to termination by the [Commission][Agency] (see 
                   Article 46). 
                   After  termination,  the  beneficiaries’  obligations  (in  particular  Articles  20,  22,  23,  Section  3  of 
                   Chapter 4, 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43 and 44) continue to apply.

               (c)  for termination of the participation of one or more beneficiaries: 
                   The coordinator must — within 60 days from when termination takes effect — submit: 
                        (iv) a report on the distribution of payments to the beneficiary concerned;  
                        (v)  a request for amendment (see Article 55), with a proposal for reallocation of the tasks and 
                            the estimated lump sum breakdown (see Annexes 1and  2) and, if necessary, the addition of 
                            one or more new beneficiaries (see Article 56). If termination is notified after the period set 
                            out  in  Article  3,  no  request  for  amendment  must  be  submitted  unless  the  beneficiary 
                            concerned is the coordinator. In this case, the request for amendment must propose a new 
                            coordinator, and  
                        (vi)  if termination takes effect during the period set out in Article 3, a termination report from 
                            the beneficiary concerned, for the open reporting period until termination, containing an 
                            overview of the progress of the work and the individual financial statement (see Article 20). 
                   The information in the termination report must also be included in the periodic report for the next 
                   reporting period (see Article 20.3). 
                   If the request for amendment is rejected by the [Commission][Agency] (because it calls into question 
                   the  decision  awarding  the  grant  or  breaches  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  of  applicants),  the 
                   Agreement may be terminated according to Article 50.3.1(c). 
                   If the request for amendment is accepted by the [Commission][Agency], the Agreement is amended 
                   to introduce the necessary changes (see Article 56). 
                   The [Commission][Agency] will — on the basis of the periodic reports, the termination report and the 
                   report on the distribution of payments — calculate the amount which is due to the beneficiary and if 
                   the (pre-financing and interim) payments received by the beneficiary exceed this amount. 
                       The amount which is due is calculated in the following steps: 
                           Step 1 — Calculation of the lump sum shares for the approved work  
                                     The grant amount for the beneficiary is calculated by adding the lump sum shares 
                                     (see Annex 2) for the approved work packages declared by the beneficiary [and 
                                     its linked third parties] in the termination report.  
                                     Only  lump sum shares for  work packages fully completed by the beneficiary 
                                     before termination will be approved — unless exceptionally agreed otherwise by 
                                     the [Commission][Agency]. 
                           Step 2 — Reduction due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious breach of 
                                     obligations 
                            
                                     If the grant is reduced (due to substantial errors, irregularities or fraud or serious 
                                     breach of obligations other than non-implementation of the action; see Article 43), 
                                     the  [Commission][Agency]  will  calculate  the  reduced  grant  amount  for  the 
                                     beneficiary by deducting the amount of the reduction (calculated in proportion to 
                                     the seriousness of the errors, irregularities or fraud or breach of obligations, in 
                                     accordance with Article 43.2) from the grant amount for the beneficiary. 
                    
                           The amount due will be the lower of the two amounts.
