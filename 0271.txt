        Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                Foreword
                Children are increasingly visible among the growing number of migrants, refugees and 
                displaced people around the world. Today, 31 million of an estimated 244 million international 
                migrants worldwide are children. At the end of 2016, the United Nations High Commissioner 
                for Refugees (UNHCR) had almost 9 million child refugees under its mandate and a further 23 
                million children were internally displaced by conlfict or natural disaster. Since 2015, increasing 
                numbers of children have made their way to Europe seeking protection and security. 
                Consequently, the rise in lodged asylum applications in Europe has created a demand for an 
                urgent public response. In this environment, the international community, including Europe’s 
                governments, are under pressure to rapidly adapt their policies and practices, to ensure the 
                safety and security of large numbers of often highly vulnerable children. 
                In September 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the New York Declaration 
                for Refugees and Migrants. While not legally binding, the Declaration commits states to 
                ‘fully protecting the human rights of all refugees and migrants, regardless of status’ and 
                to ‘protecting the rights of uprooted children’. The 193 UN Member States also committed to 
                negotiating two Global Compacts: a Global Compact on Refugees; and a Global Compact on 
                Safe, Regular and Orderly Migration.
                In this context, the UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti has collaborated with the National 
                Committees for UNICEF in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden in undertaking 
                research that contributes to this goal. This research has assessed how Nordic countries have 
                responded to the movement of asylum-seeking children who have entered the region since 
                2015, and has identiifed insights from comparison of practices across these countries. 
                While the region provides a range of experiences which are, in many ways, representative 
                of best practices globally, there are important gaps and lessons to be learnt by comparing 
                policies, institutions and practices. This report identiifes a number of good practices and 
                lessons and provides concrete recommendations on what more can be done to protect and 
                integrate children and guarantee them opportunities for their future.

                                     Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
             As the international community comes together to strengthen governance procedures for 
             global migration and establish guidelines for sharing responsibility to safeguard refugees, 
             UNICEF has called on decision-makers to put children at the centre of their discussions. 
             Speciifcally, UNICEF asks that they embrace a six-point Agenda for Action, outlined in the 
             Global Compacts:
             1. Protect uprooted children from exploitation and violence.
             2. End the detention of refugee and migrant children by creating practical alternatives.
             3. Keep families together and give children legal status.
             4. Help uprooted children to stay in school and stay healthy.
             5. Press for action on the causes that uproot children from their homes.
             6. Combat xenophobia, discrimination and marginalization.
              
             We now have a tremendously important opportunity to develop actionable commitments that 
             can ensure that refugee and migrant children receive the care and protection they need – 
             whether in their countries of origin, in transit, or in destination countries. I hope that the 
             analysis and ifndings presented in this report will help inform global and national discussions 
             on how states and the international community can protect refugee and migrant children, 
             and that it offers direction and guidance to all countries as they work towards adopting and 
             implementing the Global Compacts.

                Nordic National Committees’ 
                Preface
                Throughout the last decades, all the countries of the Nordic region have been rightly 
                recognized for their constant efforts to promote and protect the human rights of children. 
                Although child rights have strong foundations in all these States, the State Parties appear 
                to have failed to protect the basic human rights of children on the move.
                A child, irrespective of her or his migration or asylum status, is ifrst and foremost a child. 
                This means that all governments have a legal responsibility to ensure that no child is 
                discriminated against in terms of receiving second-tier protection or care arrangements, 
                insufifcient health services or segregated educational services. 
                The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides all State Parties with an ideal roadmap for 
                the full inclusion, protection and development of all children. A more coherent adaptation 
                of the Convention cannot but lead to a more prosperous future for the generations to come, 
                where all children are ifrst and foremost children.
                It has been our pleasure to work alongside the UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti to 
                produce this research to inform our advocacy strategies in the Nordic region. This research 
                will also contribute to a better understanding of asylum-seeking children’s protection and 
                rights, globally.

                                             Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                Executive summary 
                Background and context
                In keeping with their long tradition of openness to refugees, the Nordic States – Denmark, 
                Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden – have, since 2015, accepted a large number of asylum-
                seeking children compared to other European countries. This has challenged their well-
                established protection systems and led to national governments clamping down on migration, 
                and protection law and regulation, leaving thousands of asylum-seeking children without the 
                care and services to which they are entitled.
                This UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti research project was commissioned by the 
                UNICEF National Committees in the Nordic region. The project’s overarching aim is to 
                examine to what extent the rights of asylum-seeking children are respected in the Nordic 
                countries, and to make concrete recommendations as to how to strengthen and extend legal, 
                policy and practice frameworks to ensure the full realization and protection of child asylum 
                seekers’ rights and entitlements. Its speciifc objective is to review national legislation and its 
                implementation in the context of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
                both to highlight good practices and to provide practical insights to the Nordic governments 
                on how to ensure the adequate protection of asylum-seeking children in line with national, 
                regional and international standards of good practice. It is intended that the ifndings of the 
                research will shape the advocacy work of the Nordic National Committees and inform their 
                engagement with their respective governments on what standards and procedural safeguards 
                must be adopted, adapted and/or implemented, to ensure that the rights of asylum-seeking 
                children are respected in full.
                The research embraced a critical, holistic and multifaceted approach. Phase I consisted of a 
                legal study of the procedural safeguards in the Nordic countries, which showed that national 
                legislation in the Nordic countries generally aligns with the Convention and with other 
                international treaties. Phase II adopted a dual focus, examining both the interpretation and 
                implementation of existing laws and regulations on the ground, and the measurement of 
                practice against international good practice standards. 
                Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews with key respondents in the 
                region. Secondary data were drawn from a review of the literature on refugees and migrants 
                in Europe and in the Nordic states, and from European databases, research and studies. 
                Data obtained from both sources were used to assess national responses to asylum-seeking 
                children by measuring each country’s activities in ifve child-related domains: general context; 
                asylum procedures; education; health; and child protection, against international best practice 
                standards.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Summary of ifndings 
                     Although the social and political environments of the ifve Nordic states are generally 
                     respectful towards children’s rights, national child protection agencies have failed to take a 
                     strong lead in relation to migrant and asylum-seeking children. National asylum agencies and 
                     their agents have generally tried to adopt a child-focused approach, but child rights are not 
                     their primary remit, and national responses have been framed in a context where a child’s 
                     legal status signiifcantly determines her or his access to entitlements. As a result, national 
                     responses in the Nordic region do not comply with the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
                     recommendations that every child, whatever her or his migration or asylum status, is ifrst 
                     and foremost a child with full entitlement to all of the rights enshrined in the Convention on 
                     the Rights of the Child; and that all governments and duty bearers have a moral and legal 
                                                                                            1
                     responsibility to realize those rights for all children in their care.  
                     The current division of responsibilities between asylum and child protection agencies appears 
                     to leave too many asylum-seeking children reliant on second-rate protection mechanisms that 
                     do not sufifciently and satisfactorily comply with the standards laid down by the Convention 
                     on the Rights of the Child and enables continuation of a context where lower standards for 
                     asylum-seeking children are tolerated. 
                     There is a clear tendency in all ifve states to give migration law precedence over the 
                     Convention on the Rights of the Child, even in those countries where the Convention has been 
                     incorporated into national law. States should also consider strengthening their legislative and 
                     policy frameworks by signing and ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of 
                     the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and thus encourage other 
                     European states to follow suit. All ifve Nordic states should also consider seriously committing 
                     fully to the EU migration acquis, which establishes a practical framework for the development 
                     across Europe of common policies, practices and standards for asylum-seeking children. 
                     Although the Nordic states have a strong culture and institutional framework of gender equality, 
                     the analysis found no documented evidence of gender awareness being incorporated in 
                     national responses to asylum-seeking children. Nor did the research ifnd sufifcient justiifcation 
                     for the variation in the levels and types of protection offered to children above and below the 
                     age of 15. 
                     To ensure children’s safety, security and stability, safeguards related to the asylum process 
                     should be incorporated in law rather than in rules and regulations. Safeguards at regulation 
                     and practice levels are essential throughout the asylum process, but their stipulation only 
                     at these levels allows too much room for wide interpretation and lax implementation, often 
                     to children’s detriment. Much stronger safeguards are required at every stage of the asylum 
                     process to allow a child legal challenge and judicial review of decisions. Age assessment and 
                     forced return are two speciifc stages of the asylum process that demand much greater scrutiny, 
                     but in fact the whole concept of ‘manifestly unnecessary’ must be strongly challenged when 
                     it comes to decisions that affect children’s lives.

                                                                      12
                                     Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
             The ‘best interests of the child’ must be the primary consideration in any and all decisions that 
             affect a child, and the core principle underpinning safeguards in all countries and at all stages 
             of the asylum process. It is worrying to note the great variation in the quality of understanding, 
             interpretation and implementation of the principle within and between the Nordic states. 
             While some best interests determinations (BIDs) genuinely aim to plan holistically for a child’s 
             welfare and protection, key respondents indicated that in practice, the quality of BIDs is mixed 
             and their impact on decision-making variable. All ifve states urgently need to establish clear 
             formats, standards and quality control mechanisms to ensure that a child’s best interests do 
             inform and inlfuence every stage of the asylum process. 
             Guardianship is a key safeguarding mechanism in the Nordic states, but there is no agreement 
             on models or standards and practical implementation is inconsistent. This is an area that 
             could beneift from regional agreement on standards and a common code of good practice 
             to ensure that: (i) both guardianship and legal representation are available to every child; 
             (ii) there is an explicit and adequate ifrewall between guardians and asylum services; and 
             (iii) there are clear guidelines in place relating to conifdentiality and to disputes or differences 
             between guardian and child, the child’s right to speak for herself or himself, and the child’s 
             right to complain about her or his guardian. National child protection agencies should also 
             establish standards, and clear procedures, for the vetting, recruitment, management, support, 
             supervision, training and resourcing of guardians. 
             The asylum-seeking child must be given better opportunities to be heard. The Nordic states 
             have a deserved reputation for respecting children’s right to be heard on matters that affect 
             them and asylum procedures relfect this. In practice, however, an asylum-seeking child – and 
             especially accompanied children - is given only limited opportunities to be heard via her or his 
             representative and even fewer opportunities to be heard directly. It is the needs of the asylum 
             system that generally determine the timing and agenda of a child’s participation, rather than 
             her or his own concerns, and so the child’s input tends to be sporadic, indirect and not always 
             heard at key points in the process. There also seems to be a lot of leeway in the asylum process 
             for adults to deny children the opportunity to speak – without consultation or justiifcation. 
             Strengthening, extending and realizing the right of every child to have her or his opinions 
             noted, and acted upon, throughout the asylum process must be central to any strategy aiming 
             to strengthen implementation of the ‘best interests’ principle. 
             Generally, the Nordic states’ education services have coped with the arrival of refugee children 
             since 2015, and their national models of inclusive education have proved ift for purpose. 
             Certain legal and administrative barriers can, however, unnecessarily delay a child’s entry into 
             mainstream education. Strengthening schools’ capacity to provide the additional resources, 
             teaching and support services needed to overcome language barriers and other obstacles 
             that hinder asylum-seeking children’s access to education would seem to be more effective 
             and cost-efifcient than delaying their enrolment by trying to address such issues outside the 
             mainstream education system. This is particularly the case for early childhood education 
             (ECE) programmes, but the same approach also applies to basic, secondary and vocational 
             education. Resources allocated to the provision of education services in reception centres 
             should be largely reassigned to the expansion of mainstream schools’ support services to 
             speed up asylum-seeking children’s integration in mainstream education.

       Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
             Asylum-seeking children can generally access any medical treatment they require, although 
             local health care services can be reluctant to offer such care. Asylum seekers are not generally 
             integrated into national health systems, so negotiating access to health care services can 
             be complex. The full extent of health care services available to asylum-seeking families 
             varies between the Nordic states, and even among municipalities within one state, so their 
             entitlements are not always clear to either patient or practitioner. The Nordic states must 
             deifne more clearly the package of services available to asylum-seeking mothers and children, 
             and make this information available to them and to practitioners at the local level. Ideally, 
             this package should be equal to the package available to all mothers and children in the 
             country, but at a minimum it should include free access to national services for mother and 
             child health, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS, vaccination, 
             adolescent health, dental care and mental health, in addition to emergency medical treatment 
             and care. Research and experience indicate that the mental health of asylum-seeking children 
             is severely affected by uncertainty about their legal status and the constraints of their living 
             conditions. Strategies are urgently required to address this serious concern and to ensure a 
             more positive living environment. 
             Research is urgently needed in all the Nordic countries to establish the real situation of detained 
             children. It is strongly recommended that the UNICEF National Committees undertake national 
             campaigns to end the use of immigration detention in any form for children, and to promote

                   Purpose, objective and scope
                   In 2016, the UNICEF National Committees in the Nordic region entered into a partnership with 
                   the UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti to conduct such an analysis through joint research 
                   on the procedural safeguards for asylum-seeking children in the ifve Nordic countries – 
                   Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The purpose of this research is to examine 
                   to what extent the rights of asylum-seeking children are respected in these countries, and 
                   to make concrete recommendations as to how to strengthen and extend legal, policy and 
                   practice frameworks to ensure the full realization and protection of child asylum seekers’ 
                   rights and entitlements. Since all migrant children in the Nordic region are dealt with under 
                   asylum legislation, this report aims to shape how the Nordic National Committees advocate 
                   for the adoption and implementation of standards and procedural safeguards that will ensure 
                   that the rights of all migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking children are respected in full. 
                   As this research aims to support the Nordic states to develop policy priorities and identify the 
                   optimal means by which to fulifl their responsibilities to protect the rights of all children, the 
                   research population includes accompanied and unaccompanied children, and both those who 
                   are successful in applying for asylum and those who are not, as well as those who are awaiting 
                   a decision on their asylum application. While recognizing the challenges that national and local 
                   authorities continue to face because of the ongoing arrival of asylum-seeking children in the 
                   Nordic region, the main focus of the research 
                   is on the capacity of the Nordic countries’ 
                   institutional frameworks to respond over the       The speciifc objective laid down for

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Methodology
                     Phase I of the research consisted of a legal study of the procedural safeguards in the Nordic 
                     countries, which was undertaken pro bono by DLA Piper ofifces in Finland, Norway and 
                     Sweden, and DLA Piper UK and Erna Blöndal in Iceland by Bruun & Hjejle in Denmark, between 
                     February and August 2017. Each country assessment includes analyses of: the legal basis for 
                     the appointment of a legal guardian and/or advisor; the assignment of interpreters; entitlement 
                     to health and education services; child participation in the asylum process; family tracing; best 
                     interests determination (BID); and age assessment.
                     The legal analysts worked within the framework of a common questionnaire designed by 
                     the UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti. Although the country assessments inevitably varied 
                     in emphasis, the research successfully highlighted key legislative and policy gaps and identiifed 
                     good practices as well as strategic responses that require more in-depth examination. The 
                     legal analysis shows that national legislation in the Nordic countries generally aligns with the 
                     Convention on the Rights of the Child and with other international treaties, and that national 
                     institutions and agencies aim to adopt a rights-based response to asylum-seeking children. 
                     The legal analysts’ ifndings provided a solid basis for the development and reifnement of 
                     Phase II of the research, which moved towards a more overtly child rights-based approach 
                     and adopted a dual focus to examine both the interpretation and implementation of existing 
                     laws and regulations on the ground, and the measurement of practice against international 
                     standards. 
                     The UNICEF Ofifce of Reseach – Innocenti contracted two senior consultants for Phase II – one 
                     with expertise in child migration, and the other a Nordic countries’ specialist. In October 2017, the 
                     team submitted a research protocol developed 
                     in line with the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical

                                                        Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                    It was crucial to conduct the examination through a child rights lens. To enable this, the team 
                                                      12 that translates the underlying principles of the Convention 
                    adopted an analytical framework
                    on the Rights of the Child into four ideal response characteristics: child-centred, equivalent, 
                    inclusive, and participative. The existing checklist of good practice indicators that underpins 
                    the analytical framework was expanded, and the indicators divided across ifve domains – 
                    general context, asylum process, education, health, and child protection – to form the 
                    framework in which to assess national responses across the Nordic region. (The research 
                    framework is outlined in more detail in Annex 2.) Child participation was envisaged as an 
                    important element of the original research plan and the initial research protocol proposed a 
                    methodology that would adequately address the related ethical issues. All parties recognized 
                    the added vulnerability of children in the asylum process, who will usually have participated 
                    – willingly or not – in a series of mandatory interviews and are thus likely to have a somewhat 
                    sceptical view of ‘interviews’. The original protocol recommended conducting interviews and/
                    or focus group discussions just with older children, and then only in settings and involving 
                    facilitators already familiar to them. When this proved dififcult to arrange, the research focus 
                    shifted to a more intense review of children’s voices in the existing research, complemented 
                    by informal discussions with young people via existing feedback mechanisms.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     1.2 The Nordic context 
                     National contexts
                     All ifve Nordic states are well-established parliamentary democracies and high-income 
                     economies. The Human Development Report 2016 ranked Norway ifrst out of 188 countries, 
                                                                                                         13 All ifve countries 
                     Denmark iffth, Iceland ninth, Sweden fourteenth and Finland twenty-third.
                     have ratiifed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Denmark and Sweden have yet to fully 
                                                                                 14 but the Convention does not clearly 
                     incorporate the Convention into national legislation,
                     trump national asylum and migration law in any of the Nordic countries. Only Denmark and 
                     Finland have ratiifed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 
                     a communications procedure. This allows the Committee on the Rights of the Child to hear 
                     complaints that a child’s rights have been violated and so could provide asylum-seeking 
                     children with an independent complaints procedure. 
                     All ifve Nordic states have ratiifed the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
                     (1951 Convention) and other relevant international treaties, but in common with most other 
                     European states, none have ratiifed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
                                                                                   15 This is the main international human

                     including those in an irregular situation. Another such instrument is the European Convention on 
                     the Legal Status of Migrant Workers, which has been ratiifed in the Nordic region only by Sweden.      16 
                     Denmark, Finland and Sweden are member countries of the EU and through ratiifcation of the 
                     Treaty of Lisbon have committed themselves to promote, protect and fulifl the rights of the 
                                                                                            17 Iceland and Norway remain 
                     child in all relevant internal and external policies and actions.
                     outside the EU but are full members of the European Economic Area and comply with EU 
                     law, policy and directives on children and migration. Although it is an EU member country, 
                     Denmark has adopted a special position in relation to EU asylum, immigration and judicial 
                     laws: Denmark does not have to take on board any such measures unless they build upon the 
                     Schengen Agreement, in which case it has six months to decide whether to incorporate the 
                                                    18
                     measure(s) into Danish law.

                    Migration and asylum context
                    The Nordic countries have a long history of acceptance of refugees and asylum seekers. This, 
                    combined with their high-income status, has placed them among the top-rated destination 
                    countries for asylum seekers, with consequent challenges for national asylum and social 
                    services in the region. The Nordic states have been particularly welcoming to refugee and 
                    migrant children, and in all ifve countries unaccompanied children are processed through 
                                        19
                    the asylum system.  Research shows that Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden 
                    accepted 45,765 unaccompanied children in 2015, out of a total of 88,250 unaccompanied 
                                                       20
                    children accepted across the EU. The highest number was registered in Sweden: 35,250 
                                                                                                 21 Eurostat ifgures

                    The high number of asylum seekers lodging applications in the Nordic countries has resulted 
                    in a backlash on other levels too. As at 31 January 2018, Denmark upholds its refusal to

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Child protection context
                     The Nordic region is renowned for its use of the Barnahus (children’s house) model, originally 
                     developed in Iceland, to work with survivors of abuse or violence. The Barnahus is a child-
                     friendly, interdisciplinary and multi-agency centre where various professionals work under 
                     the same roof to investigate suspected cases of child sexual abuse and to provide appropriate 
                     support for child survivors of abuse. The aim is to avoid subjecting a child to repeated 
                     interviews by many agencies in multiple locations, including the courtroom, as research has 
                     shown that this can be very traumatic for the child. Using the child-friendly environment of 
                     the Barnahus for investigative interviews reduces the anxiety level of a child, which in turn is 
                     crucial for successfully eliciting the child’s disclosure. 
                     Barnahus Iceland has inspired the establishment of around 50 such centres across the 
                     Nordic countries during recent years. All of the Nordic states – except Finland – apply this 
                     approach, although the actual models used vary. Norway’s Barnahus facilities are run by 
                     central government, for example, while regional or local authorities operate those in Denmark 
                                                                                                                          30 
                     and Sweden. The model is recommended as good practice by Council of Europe standards
                     and has been promoted by the monitoring body of the Council of Europe Convention on the 
                     Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote Convention). 
                     In Iceland, asylum interviews for UASC are held in Barnahus centres, and there is clearly scope 
                     for the other Nordic countries to adapt the Barnahus model to facilitate more effective and 
                     child-friendly engagement between child asylum seekers and national asylum systems.31
                     A 2011 UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti analysis found that in each of the Nordic countries 
                     the responsibility for policy planning and operational tasks related to child protection is shared 
                                                        32 
                     among a plethora of institutions.    Matters concerning asylum-seeking children at that time fell 
                     under the mandates of various ministries, with multiple institutions and authorities involved 
                     in their implementation. This seems to still be the case. Key respondents for the present 
                     analysis conifrmed that the ownership and/or leadership of national responses to asylum-
                     seeking children remain divided among a complex web of federal and local agencies whose 
                                                                                                                      These 
                     convoluted division of responsibilities can lead to institutional tensions and friction.
                     tensions can negatively affect child asylum seekers’ access to services such as education, 
                     health, housing and justice.33 For instance, long waiting times for services in Sweden indicate 
                     that communication between state and municipality is far from ideal. The Ombudsman for 
                     Children in Sweden found that the children interviewed had neither been assigned a guardian 
                                                             34
                     nor put in touch with social services.  One child reported what migration personnel had said

                                                                                                                     36 
                    to address child trafifcking related to child protection strategies and action plans.
                    Likewise, the present analysis found that the Nordic countries typically lack comprehensive, 
                    multi-sectoral strategies and plans relating to asylum-seeking children. 
                    Asylum and child protection are discrete functions of central government in the Nordic states, 
                    but the responsibility for providing child protection services has been delegated to local 
                                                      37 This model has proved successful in protecting vulnerable 
                    authorities in all ifve countries.
                    children’s rights. However, in the absence of a corresponding devolution of responsibility and 
                    resources in the asylum process, the model only further fragments the response to asylum-
                    seeking children. Finland, Iceland and Sweden each have an explicit national child protection 
                    law and a national child protection strategy; Denmark does not - though it has attempted 
                    to - include a child protection perspective in law with the ‘child’s reform’ (Barnet’s reform), 
                    but leaves it to the local authorities to develop action plans. Although local authorities in the 
                    Nordic region generally adopt an integrated approach to the provision of child protection and 
                    care services, and accept responsibility for all children who reside in a given municipality, 
                    how they understand and interpret their obligations may vary, and the extent to which 
                    they can inlfuence asylum decisions made centrally is limited. Tensions between different 
                    sectoral perspectives at the national and local levels enable gaps in oversight, ambivalent 
                    interpretations of legislation, a fragmented approach and inconsistent practice, all of which 
                    can severely weaken a child asylum seeker’s protective environment.

                     An analytical framework sets the parameters of the present research’s review of national 
                     law, policy, strategies and actions relating to asylum-seeking children in the Nordic countries. 
                     In line with the child rights-based approach to this research, the framework assesses how far 
                     such responses translate into practice the principles underlying the Convention on the Rights 
                     of the Child, as a result of being by nature: 
                     Child-centred: The Committee on the Rights of the Child asserts that “a child is ifrst and 
                                                                                                           39 
                     foremost a child, whatever the condition he or she may ifnd himself or herself in”.     This implies 
                     that it is the best interests  of the individual child – rather than her or his legal or asylum status – 
                     that should always be the primary consideration in determining legislative, policy and service 
                     responses to asylum-seeking children.
                     Equivalent: The principle of non-discrimination stipulates that all children in a country should 
                     enjoy full access to their rights, irrespective of their legal or other status. This implies that 
                     national authorities should try to provide asylum-seeking children with the same level of 
                     access to entitlements and services as nationals enjoy, and strive to reduce the barriers that 
                     restrict equal access.
                     Inclusive: The non-discrimination principle implies that national authorities should adopt an 
                     inclusive approach towards every child for the duration of their stay in country, regardless 
                     of their legal status. Thus, the authorities should aim to integrate asylum-seeking children 
                     into mainstream child and family services as soon as possible, rather than support parallel 
                     structures or services for this group.
                     Participative: Involving children as far as possible in decision-making at every level is key to 
                     the full realization of their rights, and it also enables more effective and efifcient action. Child 
                     participation involves not only the provision of mechanisms to allow children’s voices to be 
                     heard, but also ensuring that due weight is given to a child’s views when making decisions 
                     that affect her or him.

                     While the framework acts as a prism through which to examine the general child rights 
                     orientation of the Nordic states’ responses to asylum-seeking children, the more detailed 
                     analysis of practice on the ground relies on measurement against a checklist of indicators 
                                                                                           40 
                     drawn from internationally accepted guidelines of good practice.        The assessment framework 
                     also took into account: (i) how far services met the criteria of availability, accessibility, 
                     acceptability and quality outlined by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 41 
                     and (ii) whether sufifcient and satisfactory safeguards were in place at the right levels (i.e. 
                     law, policy, regulation, practice) to ensure the full realization of asylum-seeking children’s 
                     rights. Country assessments examined ifve priority domains: general context, asylum 
                     process, education, health, and child protection. Although the checklist used does not enable 
                     quantitative measurement of every activity, responses to clusters of questions can indicate 
                     how far a speciifc activity or service adopts a rights-based approach to translating a child’s 
                     entitlements into reality. Taken together, these responses enable an evaluation of both the 
                     social, institutional, organizational and policy frameworks that determine asylum-seeking 
                     children’s protective environment, and the strategic and operational practices in each country. 
                     2.2 Assessment of the national responses 
                     Ownership/leadership
                     In the Nordic countries, child protection agencies seem to have allowed asylum services to 
                     take responsibility for decisions regarding asylum-seeking children, despite their national 
                     remit to offer care and protection to all vulnerable children. Asylum and child protection 
                     services do work in partnership, however, 
                     and asylum agencies have clearly worked 
                     hard to provide a child-focused service. 
                     Yet there is an inherent tension between  No matter how child-friendly asylum

              Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                            have, in principle, the same rights to child protection services as other children. There are 
                            differences between municipalities in the child protection services they offer to asylum- 
                            seeking children. Schools and maternal and child health clinics are responsible for child 
                            welfare notiifcation. In Denmark, referral is delayed until the child has been granted asylum, 
                            which can take months or even years. Once asylum is granted, however, full access to 
                            local services kicks in, putting great pressure on the ofifces of such services to coordinate 
                            support and integration efforts to ifnd a school and housing for the child, respond to any special

                            needs and so on.  Research carried out in Norway and Denmark in 2010 indicated that

                            while adopting a child rights perspective helped to produce a nuanced picture of migration

                            practices in the country.
                            fact that national asylum services retain primary responsibility for asylum-seeking children in 
                            all of the Nordic countries, means that a ‘client’ is seen ifrst and foremost as an ‘asylum seeker’ 
                            or ‘migrant’ rather than as a child, and this perception strongly inlfuences the parameters of 
                            the service agreement between the child and the state. Establishing the precedence of the 
                            Convention on the Rights of the Child over national asylum law could greatly strengthen the 
                            authority and role of child protection services in relation to asylum-seeking children, but this 
                            approach is not always accepted in the Nordic region. 
                            There is no clear or comprehensive understanding of exactly how the dynamic between 
                            central and local governance inlfuences either the working relationship between the various 
                            agencies in the Nordic region or the balance of authority in decision-making processes. While 
                            cooperation across sectors seems to be working on the ground, it is unclear whether speciifc 
                            mechanisms are in place to ensure multi-sectoral cooperation across all levels of government, 
                            whether this is negotiated on a case-by-case basis, or whether it has simply evolved organically 
                            and informally in various locations. In terms of safeguards, it seems important to have a 
                            formal mechanism in place, not only to facilitate high-quality inter-sectoral cooperation, but 
                            also to review, revise and improve coordination on an ongoing basis.
                            Finland, Iceland and Norway have integrated the Convention on the Rights of the Child into 
                            national law, and clear, explicit acceptance of the primacy of the Convention over national law 
                            could have a positive impact on the balance of authority between asylum and child protection 
                            agencies. In Norway, the Convention takes precedence over any other legislative provision, 
                                                             46 but  the status of the Convention in relation to migration law is 
                            including asylum law,
                            unclear in most of the Nordic countries. In Sweden, no formal decision has yet been made 
                            to incorporate the Convention into national law by 2020, although this is the government’s 
                            intention and it will proceed with a formal proposal to parliament in 2018. Denmark, on the 
                            other hand, sees no need to integrate the Convention into national law.47

                     All of the Nordic countries appear to distinguish – in law, in policy and in practice – between 
                     children above and below the age of 15. It is unclear how relevant it is to make such a distinction 
                     in relation to asylum. In Sweden, greater weight is given to input into the asylum process 
                     made by children aged 15 years or older, and this age group is also given more opportunities 
                     to feed into decision-making processes. In other Nordic countries, however, older asylum-
                     seeking children are more likely to be placed in an institution or held in detention, and they are 
                     less likely to be actively searched for in the event that they go missing. 
                     Oversight 
                     Appropriate implementation bodies are required at all levels, especially if children are not in 
                     the formal care of state child protection agencies. None of the Nordic countries appear to have 
                     a national board, body or parliamentary committee that has ifnal and overall accountability 
                     for asylum-seeking children. Mixed messages were also drawn from the ifeld in relation to 
                     oversight by an ombudsperson and/or other independent human rights monitoring body. An 
                     ombudsperson is entitled to visit reception centres in all of the Nordic states and has done so 
                                                          48 
                     in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but the ombudsperson’s remit in relation to wider asylum 
                     issues is unclear. Primary evidence suggests that there uncertainty about the extent to which 
                     internal evaluations of reception facilities are produced and made public – though this may be 
                     done in other countries, for instance, by the Swedish Migration Agency.49
                     The Phase I analyses appear to suggest that not all Nordic region residential facilities that host 
                     asylum-seeking children are subject to the same standards of oversight as other residential

                     facilities for children.
                     residential facilities given the variety of managing agencies involved, or whether such facilities 
                     are open to public scrutiny. In Finland, for instance, where reception centres are run by the 
                     Finnish Immigration Service, NGOs and private companies, the Finnish Immigration Service 
                                                                                       51 In all of the Nordic countries, 
                     supervises the centres by making unannounced inspections.
                     there is a need to strengthen external oversight of asylum services and facilities, as regular 
                     and ongoing scrutiny by a range of actors – ombudsperson, civil society, parliament and 
                     the general public – is one of the strongest possible safeguards available to children in the 
                     asylum system.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                      Access to justice 
                      While the Nordic states legally recognize the child’s right to information, differences persist 
                      depending on the pressure on the asylum system, and on whether children travel alone or 
                      accompanied. Children have expressed scepticism that full information was shared with them 
                      or that their right to receive information was realized: as the girls interviewed in Finland reported, 
                                                                            52 
                      “It’s just a signature, it doesn’t work in practice.”   Children in Sweden have conifrmed the lack 
                      of sufifcient information – let alone child-friendly information – with one child reporting: “I was 
                      at the interview and afterwards I was very anxious and did not know what to think because I 
                                                            53 
                      did not know how this would end.” Skårdalsmo and Harnischfeger found similar experiences 
                      among children in Norway who asked to be given “a sense of the rules”, clearly indicating a 
                      lack of child-friendly material.54 
                      As a rule, accompanied children are not informed about the asylum process in Denmark, 
                                                                                  The Icelandic Ombudsman for Children 
                      as they are considered part of their parents’ case.
                      remarked that informing children of their rights is a “huge problem in Iceland for accompanied 
                      children” who receive neither an independent case examination nor legal aid.55
                      In terms of access to justice, UASC are generally better protected than accompanied children. 
                      While UASC are automatically assigned a legal representative, accompanied children are not. 
                      The expectation is that a child’s best interests will concur with those of her or his family, 
                      and that the child’s parents will represent her or him adequately throughout the asylum 
                      process. The model for legal representation varies across the Nordic countries. In Norway, for 
                      instance, the guardians (representants) are recruited and trained by the Country Governor and 
                                                                                                      56
                      the guardian has the function of legal representation and spokesperson.           In Denmark, the Red 
                      Cross provides both the child’s legal representative and guardian – the former is a Red Cross 
                                                          57                                   58 
                      employee, the latter a volunteer.  The set-up is similar in Iceland.
                      In Sweden, the child has the right to a guardian appointed by the chief custodian’s ofifce in 
                      the relevant municipality and to legal representation in the asylum process, although the legal 
                                                                                            59 
                      presence is not required for the asylum interview to take place.        In Finland, on the other hand, 
                      the district court appoints the guardian, who is responsible for ensuring that the child’s right 
                      to legal representation is realized.60

                                                                      street.
                   representative is meant to function as an 
                   unaccompanied child’s primary source of 
                   support throughout the asylum process, 
                   but this responsibility is not necessarily qualiifed in law. There are also concerns about 
                   the independence of guardians and legal representatives and the nature of the contractual 
                   relationship with individual asylum-seeking children. The guardians are dependants of 
                   the Finnish Immigration Service – which pays their salaries and is in charge of the group 
                   homes. The Finnish Immigration Service’s relationship with the guardian affects the nature 
                   and extent of the contractual relationship between a child and her or his guardian. Generally, 
                   children are assigned a guardian and have little say in the appointment. Except in Norway, 
                   guardians neither observe a clear protocol on conifdentiality nor have a clear mandate to make 
                   a child’s views known if these are at odds with the guardian’s own opinion of the child’s best 
                   interests. It is unclear what happens in such a situation, and the child’s right to complain about 
                   the guardian or seek a replacement is very restricted. Finally, the shortage of appropriate 
                   guardians and the absence of a cap on the number of children a guardian may support can 
                   lead to serious neglect. In Sweden, this has led to guardians amassing far more children than 
                   they can care for properly, and better supervision and monitoring of the situation is needed.61 
                   Full access to legal aid and judicial review – which should constitute the second key strand 
                   of any safeguarding strategy – must be available to children throughout every stage of the 
                   asylum process. Yet judicial review is only 
                   available in the Nordic countries at certain 
                   stages of the asylum process, and then             Good Practice 3: Denmark

                     cut the hourly reimbursements payable to lawyers. Similar processes have also been put in 
                     place in Norway. UASC have a right to a lawyer, but their lawyer is not automatically part of 
                     the asylum process. After a negative decision, the lawyer is restricted to ifve hours’ work 
                                                        63
                     to review and repeal the cases.  Restrictions in time, funding and eligibility all act to erode 
                     children’s basic right to legal advice, and a service cannot really be considered available if the 
                     child cannot afford it. 
                     Child participation 
                     Child participation is another key safeguarding element that should underpin the entire asylum 
                     process. The Nordic model of child participation generally relfects a positive societal view of 
                     children as rights-holders who have an inherent capacity to formulate and express life plans, 
                     and this perspective is enshrined in national law in all ifve countries. While all ifve states have 
                     incorporated the principle of child participation into their asylum processes and established 
                     procedures to allow children to speak and be heard, research in Iceland on the appointment of 
                     spokespersons in child protection work indicates that enforcement of the law is characterized 
                                                                             64 Another report, from Norway, indicates 
                     by a lack of formality, protocols and assessment.
                     that there can also be a lack of effective national complaints procedures for children, and an 
                     absence of political will to provide such procedures.65
                     Training in communicating with children is available in the Nordic countries, but key 
                     respondents have suggested that children are often not consulted appropriately or

                     no independent status, and thus remain “invisible in the process”.
                     national migration legislation, these children are only heard in the asylum process if it 
                                              68 Though this clause is often used as a reason not to hear children, 
                     is “not inappropriate”.
                     the deifnition of ‘inappropriate’ is not always clear. Even when children are heard, they are 
                                                                                                                    69 even

                     and the formats and parameters prescribed for input by children tend to facilitate the asylum

                     formal acceptance of a child’s input and the              sought. Even when the law allows for 
                     limited support for the child to appeal against           consultation with the child, it can also 
                     decisions with which she or he disagrees.                 send a strong message that the child

                     nor consistently practised. It also seems                 to decide that hearing the child is 
                                                                               ‘manifestly unnecessary’ without 
                     likely that different standards are applied to            having to justify that decision to the 
                     asylum-seeking children and to nationals in               child. It is not clear whether these 
                     relation to the right to be heard.                        arrangements mirror those in the child 
                                                                               protection system. 
                     The Danish Children’s Reform provides 
                     that children in Denmark have a “right to be 
                     involved from the age of 12 years in all aspects including complaints about assignment of 
                     special support, repatriation from a placement or a foster family or other angles on children’s 
                     life”.71 Under Finland’s Child Welfare Act, a child is considered a party to any proceeding in 
                     child welfare matters, and children aged 12 years or older have full procedural rights in matters 
                                       72 The Child Protection Act in Iceland guarantees every child the opportunity 
                     that affect them.

                                                       However, in practice, immigration always speaks to children 
                     to express her or his views.
                     over the age of 15, and assesses the need to speak to younger children on an individual basis. 
                     In Norway a child has the right to be heard even below the age of seven years under the 
                                                                                            74  Finland has committed to 
                     Children’s Act, the Child Welfare Act and the Immigration Act.
                     enabling children from the age of 12 (or sometimes even younger) to give their input to the 
                     asylum process, but in most Nordic countries only children aged 15 years or older seem to 
                     enjoy in full the right to participate in the asylum process.

          Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                    Best interests of the child
                    The Convention on the Rights of the Child gives children the legal right to have their best 
                    interests accepted as the primary consideration in any decision-making process that concerns 
                    them. The Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends in its General comment No. 14 
                    (2013)75 that the child’s best interests are examined and determined in each individual case in 
                    light of the speciifc circumstances of each child or each group of children, and are related to 
                    the individual characteristics of the child or group of children concerned, including the social 
                    and cultural context in which the child or group of children ifnd themselves.
                    National law in all ifve of the Nordic countries stipulates that a best interests determination 
                    (BID) should be conducted during the asylum process, in line with the Convention’s legal 
                    imperative. By law, a child’s best interests must be taken into account during asylum 
                    proceedings, and decisions can be legally challenged on the basis of the child’s best interests. 
                    Yet Danish law does not deifne the best interests principle, and key respondents raised doubt 
                                                                                                                      76 
                    about the existence of a systematized holistic best interests assessment (BIA) procedure.
                    How BIA is practised for unaccompanied and accompanied children in the Nordic region also 
                    differs, as migration authorities appear to deem the best interests of accompanied children 
                    identical to those of their families, often overlooking them for individual assessment, as is 
                                          77 UDI, the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, also complains about 
                    the case in Finland.
                    the lack of material and training on the best interests of accompanied children, resulting in 
                                                                                                                    78 
                    accompanied children being assessed by ofifcials who lack the appropriate competencies.
                    In practice, all BIAs (including BIDs) conducted in the Nordic region examine the child’s: age/
                    maturity; situation in the country of origin; family network and/or connections in the host 
                    country; and experience of physical and/or mental abuse/traumas; plus any other factors 
                    deemed relevant. Children are entitled to feed into all types of BIA and BID in every Nordic 
                    country, although the mechanisms in place to facilitate their input vary considerably in quality. 
                    All of the Nordic countries lack clear protocols and formats for BIAs and BIDs, which can lead 
                    to poor-quality assessments and gaps in good practice. Key respondents in several countries 
                    raised concerns about whether BIAs meet in-country standards, let alone the standards 
                    required by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in some countries they raised 
                                                                                                   79
                    concerns about whether BIAs are conducted at all at the requisite times.

                         specialized organizations and agencies.
                    79   Various procedural guides have been developed but they lack consistency and depth. See, for example,

                    The Committee on the Rights of the Child also recommends that child protection authorities 
                    within child protection systems should always be involved, with a lead role , in BID
                                 80 There is no consistency across the Nordic region, however, in terms of who 
                    procedures.
                    conducts BIDs, at what stage of the asylum process they are undertaken, or their purpose 
                    and function in the asylum process. Evidence from Finland, Norway and Sweden suggests that 
                    immigration authorities tend to carry out BIDs with a speciifc focus on whether a child should 
                                                                                     81 
                    remain in the country or return to her or his country of origin.   Other sources relate how child 
                    protection authorities, in contrast, are likely to assess a child’s best interests with a speciifc 
                    focus on care arrangements, possible risks and/or experiences of violence, exploitation or 
                           82 
                    abuse.
                    Two formal BIDs are mandated in Iceland: a procedural BID tied in with a medical examination, 
                    conducted as soon as possible after the immigration authorities receive an asylum application; 
                    and a refugee status BID conducted by the child protection authorities to determine whether 
                    a child requires protection. However, in Iceland, there is a shortage of interpreters and social 
                    workers have reported the need for more training in cultural sensitivity and communication with 
                    ethnic minority families.83 Unaccompanied children represent a new ifeld in child protection 
                    in Iceland and so far no guidance is available on how to work with such children. In Finland, a 
                    reception centre social worker will conduct a BIA before the asylum interview, which may take 
                    place a considerable time after the child’s arrival at the centre, and other BIAs are conducted 
                                                       84 In Norway, reception centre personnel usually conduct a 
                    throughout the asylum process.
                    BID soon after a child’s arrival to determine her or his immediate welfare needs, though it 
                    also focuses on the longer term, to identify durable solutions. A commitment to assessing, 
                    determining and realizing the best interests of the individual child is a core value common 
                    to asylum, migration and child protection services in the Nordic region, and it underpins 
                    several major procedural safeguards in all three systems. Yet none of the Nordic countries 
                    are conducting BIAs and BIDs as they should be conducted, and it is strongly recommended 
                    that common models are adopted and consistently applied across all ifve states.85

                         Child into 24 questions relating to: (a) the child’s current living situation; (b) the expected future situation if the 
                         current child-rearing and living situation continues; and (c) the expected future situation if an alternative child-
                         rearing and living situation is chosen. A professional can use this questionnaire to assess the child’s current 
                         environment and to compare it with the situation which can be expected to result following a speciifc decision.

          Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                    2.3 The asylum process 
                     
                    Arrival and registration 
                    It is common practice across the Nordic region for no unaccompanied child to be denied 
                    entry nor deported, even if entry conditions are not met. To strengthen the child’s protective 
                    environment, however, it is recommended that national law be amended to relfect good 
                    practice on the ground. Child protection services are not usually represented at border points 
                    in the Nordic countries, so a child’s ifrst contact with state authorities is likely to be with 
                    border guards or police ofifcers, who do not necessarily possess child competencies. The 
                    initial contact between child and state representative is important as it sets the parameters 
                    of the relationship for both parties. It can inlfuence state decisions regarding entry and the 
                    child’s assignment to subsequent procedures as well as decisions the child makes about

                    available to border guards and police ofifcers in Finland, Norway and Sweden to help identify

                     There is a need to ensure that: border guards and police ofifcers in all ifve Nordic countries 
                     are skilled in child-friendly communication; asylum-seeking children can access interpreters 
                     and independent support at the point of contact; and inter-agency protocols facilitate rapid 
                     engagement by national child protection authorities. 
                     In terms of making referrals to child protection services, police ofifcers in Iceland summon 
                     child protection services to the airport on encountering UASC; in Denmark, UASC are 
                                                                                                                        88 
                     immediately taken to a reception centre, with registration taking place the very next day.
                     Border authorities in Finland also refer UASC to the child protection authority immediately, 
                     without ifrst conifrming their ages. An unaccompanied minor (who informs the authorities of 
                     her or his age) is either sent to a group home or a supported housing unit for unaccompanied 
                             89 
                     minors. UASC aged 15 years or older arriving in Norway are referred to special care facilities 
                     run by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, while those below the age of 15 are referred 
                                                                        
                     to centres run by the child protection authority. In Sweden, UASC must be registered as asylum 
                     seekers to be included in the protection system.
                     Age assessment 
                     In 2017, the Committee on the Rights of the Child prescribed that the state must “undertake 
                     a comprehensive assessment of the child’s physical and psychological development”, to be 
                     conducted by “specialist paediatricians or other professionals who are skilled in combining 
                     different aspects of development”. The assessment should be carried out in a “child-friendly, 
                     gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner” which must include child participation 
                     and interviews with “accompanying adults, in a language the child understands”. The 
                     Committee further stipulates that documents should be considered genuine unless proved 
                     false and that beneift of the doubt should be given to the individual being assessed. The 
                     Committee advises that “States should refrain from using medical methods based on, inter 
                     alia, bone and dental exam analysis” because these have a wide margin of error and can be 
                     traumatic. Finally, all states should ensure that their determinations can be reviewed by or 
                                                                      90
                     appealed before a suitable independent body.  
                     No Nordic state lives up to the guidelines provided by the Committee in 2017. The grounds, 
                     timing and methods for conducting age assessment differ across the Nordic countries. The 
                     same goes for the states’ compliance with Committee on the Rights of the Child General 
                     comment No. 6, which stipulates that age assessment should take into account psychological 
                     maturity as well as physical appearance and be conducted in a scientiifc, fair, safe, and child- 
                     and gender-sensitive manner, avoiding any risk of violation of the physical integrity of the child 
                     and giving due respect to human dignity. According to Article 25(5) of the recast EU Asylum 
                     Procedures Directive, age assessment should only be used where there are grounds for serious 
                     doubt of an individual’s age, and the least invasive examination should always be selected.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     In the Nordic countries, age assessment is permitted where there is ‘reasonable doubt’ about 
                     an individual’s age, but it is unclear how reasonable doubt is deifned, who decides that there 
                     is reasonable doubt and what safeguards are in place to prevent abuse of the concept. Border 
                     guards and police ofifcers base initial estimates of age on identity documents and on a visual 
                     assessment at the point of entry, although Denmark claims to rely solely on documentation: 
                     in cases where documents are dififcult to obtain or have no legal bearing, the Danish Refugee 
                     Council noted that age assessment has become the all-important proof, risking ruling out the 
                                                      91 As part of the Danish asylum procedure for unaccompanied 
                     beneift of doubt for the child.
                     children, the immigration authorities start by assessing the maturity of the individual, asylum- 
                     seeking child. If the child is deemed too immature to go through the Danish asylum procedure 
                     a temporary residence permit may be granted. Children with family in the home country are, 
                     however, not given a temporary permit, according to section 9c (3)(i) of the Danish Alien Act. 
                     These unaccompanied children, who are often very young (most between 12 and 14 years old 
                     but in some cases as young as 9 years old) are then given the choice of either waiting at asylum 
                     centres in Denmark until they are deemed sufifciently mature by the immigration authorities, in 
                     order to have their asylum case processed or – notwithstanding the maturity assessment – of 
                                                                                  92
                     continuing with the asylum claim assessment procedure.         In Finland, in practice, the authorities 
                     consider anyone who refuses to go through the age assessment process an adult by default, and 
                     UDI in Norway has stated that age assessment 
                                            93

                     is “used too much”
                     found that “medical assessments are given                 State authorities in all ifve Nordic 
                                                                     94

                     In 2013, the European Asylum Support Ofifce recommended 12 safeguards in relation to age 
                     assessment, but while all Nordic states observe some of these, no state has put all of the safeguards 
                     in place (see Table 4).97 For instance, neither Denmark nor Finland tries other approaches before 
                     using age assessment techniques, and in practice all of the Nordic states focus increasingly on 
                     medical results when determining the age of young asylum applicants. In Sweden, paediatricians 
                     have refused to conduct examinations for age assessment purposes given the high margin of 
                     error involved as well as the importance that seems to be placed on such examinations. 98
                     Norwegian practice has for some years been out of line with children’s rights, and in November 
                     2017 the Norwegian state lost a case on age determination on the grounds that medical 
                     assessments are insufifciently thorough and had been ordered without the necessary legal 
                                                   99
                     procedures being followed.  As a result, all age assessments in Norway are now conducted 
                                                          100
                     at institutes for forensic medicine.    UDI has been active in developing a better approach and 
                     reported in June 2017 that it will implement a new technique called BioAlder (bio age) with the

          Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                    In practice, the decision to conduct age assessment is often left to the discretion of the 
                    migration authority’s case worker. Ideally, the case worker should base the decision on whether 
                    the child appears age appropriate and has valid and genuine documentation to conifrm her 
                    or his age. Viewed from a child’s rights perspective, as presented in the recent Joint general 
                    comment from the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the strict rules for what count as valid 
                    and genuine documents, as well as the role of the case worker, can lower the standard in some 
                               102 
                    countries.   In a report examining a sample of 145 cases, the Swedish Migration Agency found 
                    that the child’s age had not been investigated sufifciently in the majority of cases due to the 
                                                     103
                    pressures on asylum systems.  In Denmark, appeals can be made to the Refugee Appeals 
                    Court, but age assessment results cannot be challenged in the other Nordic countries, except 
                    in the context of a wider appeal against an asylum application decision. This is important to 
                    note since the consequence of an incorrect assessment is the total denial of the child’s rights.
                    In Sweden, many UASC aged 15 years or older were classiifed as adults without any age 
                    assessment – medical or otherwise – having ifrst been performed and, as a result, lost all of 
                    their entitlements as children. It is interesting to note that when the Immigration and Asylum 
                    Appeals Board in Iceland reviewed age assessment results as part of a wider challenge, it 
                    interpreted them in a different way to the Directorate of Immigration. This would seem 
                    to further strengthen the case for each country to have a speciifc appeals process for age 
                                   104
                    assessments.
                    Key respondents in all countries indicated that asylum applicants today are rarely offered the 
                                                                                                                105 Age 
                    beneift of the doubt, which was standard procedure as recently as a few years ago.
                    assessment is not an exact science, yet it appears there is no agreement on which combination 
                    of techniques produces the most accurate results, or on how to interpret results. In Denmark, 
                    where age assessment typically provides an estimated age spanning several years, such 
                    techniques should in principle be only one element of the Danish Immigration Service’s 
                    overall age assessment, but key respondents suggest that age assessment is given almost 
                                            106 In Norway, age assessment determines the probability (expressed 
                    exclusive importance.
                    as a percentage) that the individual is the age that she or he claims to be, and on this basis an 
                    assessment is made as to whether the individual is likely to be over the age of 18. Thus, even 
                    if the methods of assessment were aligned across the Nordic region, the results would not 
                    be transferable across the ifve countries, which could necessitate a child undergoing two or 
                    more age assessments.

                     Asylum application 
                     In principle, the Nordic States prioritize UASC but not families to a special or speedier process. 
                     In reality, this does not seem to work. Currently, the Finnish Immigration Service is obliged 
                     to speed up the process for asylum-seeking children, but a representative indicated in an 
                     interview that it was failing to meet this goal in 2015/16. From summer 2018, Finnish law 
                     will stipulate a maximum processing time that will oblige the authorities to proceed with 
                     the applications immediately. In Sweden, in 2017, the average time to process each asylum 
                     application made by UASC was 578 days, and statistics from the Swedish Migration Agency 
                     and Norway show that the processing time for asylum applications made by UASC is in fact 
                                                              107 The Danish Immigration Service has established an 
                     longer than for those made by adults.
                     average processing time for an asylum claim at seven months, but readily admits “most cases 
                                               108 
                     take less time or longer”.
                     All of the Nordic countries ensure that a guardian or legal representative supports each 
                     unaccompanied child throughout the asylum application process, although both the roles 
                     and the nature of the support provided can vary across the states. In Iceland, for instance, 
                     the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration appoints a representative for the unaccompanied 
                     child when she or he formally applies for asylum; the Directorate also notiifes the local child 
                     welfare committee and the Government Agency for Child Protection of the application. The 
                     Government Agency’s role is to ensure that the best interests of the child are considered 
                     and to oversee the child welfare committee’s remit to provide accommodation, health and 
                     education services for the child. Unfortunately, key respondents indicated that this approach 
                     is not working in practice, often resulting in UASC in the reception centre being left to their 
                     own devices in the company of adults, due to staff members having insufifcient capacity to 
                     properly care for them. Research carried out in 2016 also found that children need to be more 
                     visible and active in the application process as a whole, and that the process itself must be 
                                                                                       109
                     better aligned with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
                     According to EU law, UASC can be granted protection status on humanitarian grounds during 
                     their stay on EU territory. Various types of permits may be granted, depending on whether the 
                     child is applying for asylum or is a victim of trafifcking in human beings and is cooperating 
                                          110 
                     with the authorities.  Finland and Norway both provide residence permits for unaccompanied 
                     children who do not meet the legal requirements to enter and stay in the country, but who 
                     cannot be returned to their countries of origin. This includes non-asylum-seeking children and 
                     those whose claims for asylum have been rejected.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Reception
                                                                                                          111 
                     The analysis of the Phase I study and Phase II interviews with key respondents          indicate that 
                     reception facilities in the Nordic region include:
                     Designated areas within mainstream reception facilities – in Denmark, Iceland and Norway,
                     Foster families – in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, 
                     Placement with relatives – in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden,
                     Separate reception facilities for children – in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
                      
                     Although the Nordic countries have a range of accommodation options available to them, 
                     institutional care seems to be the most likely option for UASC. For example, in Sweden, the 
                     municipal authorities are responsible for arranging the placement of unaccompanied children 
                     in reception facilities; accompanied children are the responsibility of the migration authorities, 
                     which often places such children with their families in mixed centres that also accommodate 
                     single men. In Norway, children aged 15 years or older are referred to a reception centre, while 
                     children under 15 years of age are usually referred to a child-care centre under the supervision 
                     of the child protection authority. Although foster home placements have sometimes been 
                     arranged even before a decision has been made about durable solutions for a child, most 
                     foster care placements for children under 15 years of age occur only after asylum has been 
                     granted. Denmark has a range of accommodation options for younger children, but those 
                     aged 17 years or older are assigned to special units within adult reception centres. In Iceland, 
                     only children aged 15 years or older are placed in reception centres. 
                     Reception centres in the Nordic region are managed by a range of actors,     112 including municipal 
                     authorities and NGOs such as the Danish Red Cross, but the speciifc situation in each country 
                     requires clariifcation. A staff of 8 or 9 counsellors plus a director for each 10 to 15 children is the 
                     norm in Sweden. The Finnish Child Welfare Act stipulates a maximum of seven children and a 
                     minimum of seven employees in one residential unit – unless there several residential units in 
                     one building – then the staff are six per unit. UASC of 16 years or above can be accommodated 
                     in supported housing units, with a maximum of 40 children in one building and three staffers 
                     per ten children, although recent amendments allow for deviations under certain undeifned 
                                     113 
                     circumstances.
                     There are no speciifc responsibilities assigned to reception centres in Iceland, but in the rest 
                     of the region, staff’s main responsibilities are supervision, counselling and providing support 
                     for children. Staff in Norwegian reception centres also ensure access, in cooperation with the 
                     municipality, to education, language or training courses, and oversee children’s entitlements 
                     to health care. In Finland, reception centre staff receiving unaccompanied children provide 
                     psychological support, assist with administrative procedures, and monitor children’s individual 
                     education plans.

                     standards, criteria and regulations for reception centres,
                     and within the Nordic countries with regard to the type of reception facilities offered and the 
                     actors involved in providing such accommodation. 
                     The Ombudsman for Children in Norway has raised concerns about children living in reception 
                     centres for prolonged periods and it noted 6,543 such cases as at August 2016. Among this

                     It is important to note in relation to the provision of reception, care and accommodation services 
                     for asylum-seeking children that the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that a state may 
                     not absolve itself of the duty to protect children by delegating the administration of services 
                                                                              125 This emphasizes a state’s obligation to 
                     – such as care or education – to private individuals.
                     ensure that all children, irrespective of their legal status, enjoy the same standards of care 
                     and protection as those stipulated under national child protection and welfare legislation. The 
                     European Court has also developed a substantial body of case law regarding the protection of 
                     children against violence in all settings, and it has identiifed clear duties incumbent on states 
                                                                                            126 
                     whenever children are placed in institutions under their authority.       This stance would seem to 
                     argue for equal standards for reception centres and child welfare homes in the Nordic states.

                     Part of the dififculty seems to be that responsibility for children’s reception centres lies with 
                     asylum authorities rather than with child welfare authorities, and that standards and safeguards 
                     are set at lower levels for asylum facilities. In Norway, for instance, the requirements for reception

                     only within the general context of her or his family’s asylum application. Thus there is broad 
                     agreement that accompanied children remain invisible in the asylum process, even where

                     across the Nordic region and can take up to two years.        There appears to be no set time limit 
                     for processing claims and many asylum-seeking children and families spend long periods 
                     in a kind of ofifcial limbo awaiting a ifnal determination. The durable solutions considered 
                     for children in the Nordic countries include: return and reintegration of the child to her or his 
                     country of origin; the granting of international protection status or another legal status to 
                     enable the child to integrate in the host country; and resettlement of the child to a third country. 
                     In all of the ifve countries, a BID will be undertaken to support the competent authority’s 
                     decision on a durable solution for the child. In the Nordic states, family reuniifcation is one 
                     of the major factors inlfuencing which durable solution is assigned, and it can be seen as the 
                     deciding factor, whether or not the child actively seeks, or even wants, reuniifcation. 
                     In Norway, IDMi, the Directorate of Diversity and Inclusion, takes responsibility when 
                     integration is selected as the durable solution. In Finland, when UASC with international 
                     protection status come of age, a multi-sectoral plan is drawn up. This plan includes sports

                     The Nordic states provide for the possibility of the voluntary return of unaccompanied children, 
                     and Finland, Norway and Sweden have speciifed the special circumstances under which UASC 
                     may return voluntarily to their countries of origin. The Return Directive 133 stipulates that before 
                     issuing a return decision in respect of an ‘unaccompanied minor’, an EU member country shall 
                     grant “assistance by appropriate bodies other than the authorities enforcing return” and give 
                                                                                
                     “due consideration to the best interests of the child”. The Return Directive allows for voluntary 
                     return as well as for resettlement to a third country, but before enforcing the removal of any 
                     UASC, member countries “shall be satisifed that he or she will be returned to a member of his 
                                                                                                                          134 
                     or her family, a nominated guardian or adequate reception facilities in the State of return”.
                     Iceland and Norway, though not members of the EU, are bound by the Return Directive as part 
                     of the Schengen acquis.
                     In all Nordic countries, the responsible authority that is considering the return and reintegration 
                     of an asylum-seeking child will perform an enquiry into the situation and conditions in the 
                     child’s country of origin, paying speciifc attention to the best interests of the child. It is unclear 
                     however, by what means the authorities inform themselves of the conditions in the countries 
                     of origin, and particularly the conditions in the receiving institutions or child-care centres of 
                     those countries. The UNICEF National Committee in Sweden has in the past developed child-
                     speciifc country of origin reports that describe the situation of children in the countries of 
                                                                                                                         135

                                        National legislation in the Nordic 
                                        countries allows for the forcible return 
                                        of unaccompanied children but this is seldom carried out. Interestingly, in Finland, there 
                                        is a Supreme Administrative Court Decision whereby the Finnish Immigration Service and 
                                        the Helsinki Administrative Court decided to return a 12-year-old unaccompanied minor to 
                                        Iraq, travelling under the custody of his uncle. Only when the case reached the Supreme 
                                        Administrative Court, was it appraised that the Finnish Immigration Service could not consider

                                        (without providing ifgures). Sweden responded that while, in principle, there are no legal 
                                        restrictions to prevent the forced return of UASC, it will only return such children to a member 
                                        of their family, a nominated guardian or adequate reception facilities. Norway indicated that it 
                                        does not forcibly return to Afghanistan unaccompanied children or women who do not have 
                                        access to a support network. Yet asylum seekers are being returned from the Nordic states

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     until they are 18 years of age, but accompanied children have been returned from the Nordic 
                     region with their families.
                     In both Norway and Sweden, a temporary permit is used to protect unaccompanied minors 
                     without a safe home situation from forcible return until they reach the age of 18, at which time 
                     they may be returned. Neither country provided an up-to-date ifgure for forcibly returned 
                     UASC, however, and it should be noted that European Migration Network data indicate that 
                     between 2009 and 2013 Norway forcibly returned 457 UASC (or former UASC) while Sweden 
                                  138 Clearly, practice in this area needs to be better understood. The tightening of 
                     returned 95.
                     asylum rules and regulations has also led to UASC in Finland being issued with temporary 
                     permits that aim to keep the child in the country until she or he can be sent home at the age 
                     of 18. As respondents in Finland put it, “this puts you in real danger of deportation if you 
                                           139 Research has noted that accompanied children in Sweden experience

                     surrounding their impending return.
                     from its international protection standards, allowing authorities to reject UASC and families and 
                                                                                                                        141
                     return them to their countries of origin, in line with the so-called ‘internal lfight alternative’.
                     New rules in Denmark expose children facing return to the poor living conditions found in 
                     so-called departure centres. Children and families denied asylum but who cannot be forcibly 
                     deported from Denmark – for example, due to a lack of identity documents– may have to live 
                     in departure centres for a long time. In 2013, the former Danish Minister for Justice, Morten 
                     Brødskov, said of the Sjaelsmark departure centre that “asylum seekers will, among others, be 
                     motivated to leave [the country] by removing their cash beneifts in favor of a food scheme”.142
                     A report on returns from Norway, based on interviews with asylum seekers who had been 
                     deported, found that the implementation of returns is typically a very scary experience.143 One 
                     boy said of the practice of ofifcers from Norway’s National Police Immigration Service letting 
                     themselves into a family’s accommodation with a key when the family is to be deported, “they 
                     should not open the door themselves, but rather ring the doorbell many times until we are 
                                                              144 
                     awake and can let them in ourselves.”      Meanwhile, a girl remarked, “they could be next to us, 
                     but not walk three [police ofifcers] behind us, in front of us and on our sides and make a circle 
                                  145 Seven out of eight families were detained for up to 24 hours awaiting return, 
                     around us.”

                     Norway recorded an increase in both 2016 and 2017 in the number of unaccompanied minors 
                     granted temporary residency. The uncertainty and insecurity experienced by such children 
                     undoubtedly cause unnecessary stress. Indeed, the Ombudsman for Children in Norway has 
                     noted growing concerns about mental health problems, self-harming, suicidal tendencies 
                     and (secondary) school absence among this group, and it points to the need for more robust 
                                                    147

                     2.4 Education 
                      
                     General context
                     National law in the Nordic countries guarantees every child access to basic education, and 
                     attendance at school is free and compulsory, but asylum-seeking children’s entitlements do 
                     not seem to be fully enshrined in law in all ifve states. In Iceland, for example, the asylum-
                     seeking child’s educational entitlements are negotiated in a contract between the Icelandic 
                     Directorate of Immigration and a municipality rather than in the Compulsory School Act. 
                     While education is a centralized function in all ifve countries, only Sweden has prioritized 
                     newly arrived migrants in national education strategies, and responsibility for the provision of 
                     education services (including quality control and supervision of professional practice) across 
                     the Nordic region has been devolved to local authorities. While this allows for greater lfexibility 
                     in countries’ responses to asylum-seeking children, it can also result in barriers to access at 
                     the local level. For instance, each municipality works to its own time frame for the provision of 
                     education services and has its own interpretation of its obligations under national legislation. 
                     Education systems in all ifve Nordic countries adopt an inclusive and gender-sensitive 
                     education model, and teachers working at all levels are familiar with the concept and practice 
                     of inclusive education. Yet several studies have revealed shortcomings in education provision 
                     and quality in the region. A 2014 report by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate noted that while 
                     it is possible for newly arrived children to receive a good education, this is dependent upon all 
                                                                                      148 Less than a quarter of surveyed 
                     of the staff at a school taking shared responsibility for this.
                     students attend such schools, leaving the vast majority in less favourable situations, and the 
                     Ombudsman for Children in Sweden has demanded that asylum-seeking children receive 
                                                                     149
                     better access to the Swedish school system.
                     Perspectives vary across the region when it comes to the inclusion of asylum-seeking children 
                     in schools. Iceland tries to place newly arrived children in community schools within six 
                     weeks, while in Denmark the process takes far longer as basic services are initially provided 
                     in a reception centre. Such variation appears to arise from different cultural traditions and

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     social perceptions of children. In Denmark, delayed enrolment stems from a genuine concern 
                     to protect children from failure. The perception is that UASC in particular are very vulnerable 
                     and should delay attending school until they have acquired the necessary skills, e.g. language 
                                                                              150 In Iceland, the perception is that the

                     child’s development.
                     seekers, however, and only three municipalities have agreed to do so. Key respondents also 
                     reported that miscommunication between national and local authorities can occur, with one 
                     informant remarking that she sometimes “had to track down the immigration authorities to 
                                                                            152
                     reach clarity about children’s access to education.”  However, since then the municipalities 
                     and immigration have managed to secure that all children will have access to school in the 
                                                           153
                     municipality where they are hosted.
                     Practices in instruction also vary across the Nordic countries. Research has shown that children 
                     without a formal education in their mother tongue but who have studied in Denmark have 
                     greater lfuency and abstract comprehension and a better vocabulary in Danish as their second 
                                                             154 Nevertheless, children are taught almost exclusively 
                     language than in their mother tongue.
                     in Danish, while tuition in the child’s mother tongue is at best provided as a secondary subject 
                                             155 In Finland too, the child’s mother tongue is ranked as a secondary 
                     or secondary learning.
                     language, although a study found that 40 per cent of students from immigrant backgrounds 
                     had “mastered the [Finnish] language so poorly that it hinders their studies and completion 
                                                156 In contrast, when Sweden revised its educational laws in 2016, it

                     awarded children the right to receive tuition in their mother tongue if they felt unable to follow

                     lessons in Swedish, and the same approach applies to children in Norway.
                     A Europe-wide study conducted in 2013 by PPMI (Public Policy and Management Institute) 
                     found that the most effective educational model for newly arrived children is an inclusive 
                     approach that provides them with equal opportunities to develop, as much as possible, within 
                     the mainstream education system, while guaranteeing them additional or remedial support, 
                                                                                158 PPMI recommended that European 
                     as necessary, in all areas (not only language teaching).
                     policymakers pay more attention to the overall structure of the education system and its effects 
                     on children’s inclusion than to individual support measures targeted at newly arrived children.

                     Early childhood education 
                     At least one year of Early Childhood Education (ECE) is the norm in the Nordic region, although 
                     this is not compulsory in Norway, Sweden or Iceland. Local authorities are responsible for 
                     both ensuring adequate provision of ECE and maintaining quality standards, so the quantity 
                     and quality of available ECE facilities can vary between municipalities. The Phase I analysis 
                     indicates that although all ifve Nordic countries try to facilitate child asylum seekers’ access to 
                     ECE, their entitlement is not necessarily enshrined in law; instead it is negotiated in regulations 
                     or in the contract between a receiving municipality and the asylum authority. In Norway, a child 
                     accommodated in a reception centre is not entitled to a place in an ECE facility, and a court case in 
                     Finland has conifrmed that municipalities are not obliged to offer ECE places to asylum-seeking 
                     children. ECE facilities are instead provided in the reception centres. Other Nordic countries 
                     allow asylum-seeking children to be placed in community-based ECE facilities. In Denmark, 
                     ECE is provided either through facilities located in the community or in reception centres. 
                     ECE programmes in reception centres do not always meet the same standards of quality 
                     as community-based services, and accountability levels and mechanisms vary between 
                     and within the Nordic countries. This opens the door to poorer-quality services and reduced 
                     beneifts for the youngest asylum-seeking children, which is unacceptable given the existence 
                     of clear standards of good practice in ECE and sufifcient guidance on how to achieve 
                     such standards.
                     Basic education
                     Asylum-seeking children are entitled, and helped, to access basic education in all of the Nordic 
                     states, although restrictions and caveats do apply. In Norway, school attendance is compulsory if 
                     a child is expected to be in the country for three months or more. 159 In Denmark, it is the reception 
                     centre’s responsibility to procure a school place for a child. In Finland, the local authority has a 
                     statutory obligation to arrange basic education for all children; asylum-seeking children are allowed 
                     to go to school but it is not compulsory for them, and the right to attend school is connected 
                     to residency. Such caveats can delay a child’s access to mainstream education for months. 
                     Delays in enrolling children in school are often explained by the requirement for language 
                     training, but this need not be separate to general education and could be provided in mainstream 
                     schools rather than in reception facilities. In Finland, language tuition is provided in schools, 
                     though sometimes in separate classes; in Denmark, it is provided in reception centres and such 
                                                                                                          160 Integration in 
                     tuition “is not validated as school education in Denmark or any other country.”
                     school life as soon as possible is essential to repair the gaps in a child’s education and to foster 
                     her or his long-term integration. It is also a vital element of the kind of normalizing strategy 
                     that should be available to all asylum-seeking children to strengthen their mental health, build 
                                                                                       161  In a 2016 submission, CARAS

                     (Community Action for Refugees and Asylum Seekers) highlighted the consequences of delays 
                     in accessing education, “The delays in securing a place have severe knock-on impacts; young 
                     people’s mental health deteriorates, and relationships with support workers are often negatively 
                     affected.”162 Full and early access to mainstream schooling is sufifciently justiifed by the proven 
                     educational beneifts to children alone, but the positive impact of regular school attendance 
                     on children’s health, welfare and development should also be considered a crucial factor in 
                     determining the educational model offered to asylum-seeking children in the Nordic regio. n
                     Support services 
                     The integrated approach to education calls for the provision of support services to ensure 
                     that schools can offer equal opportunities for asylum-seeking children to develop, as much 
                     as possible and as early as possible, within the mainstream education system. Additional 
                     or remedial support must be provided, as necessary, in all areas – support must not be 
                     limited to tuition in the host country’s ofifcial language. The PPMI research notes that it is 
                     important to tailor educational support to 
                     a child’s individual needs and to ensure its

                     systems in host countries at the same time as it expands an individual’s access to services. For 
                     all of these reasons, the European Commission recommends the early integration of refugees 
                                                                                         167 
                     in vocational education and training initiatives and programmes.       It is particularly important 
                     to promote early intervention initiatives for vulnerable young people not in employment, 
                     education or training (NEETs) – whether they are nationals, refugees or migrants – to support 
                     their swift integration in education, apprenticeships, traineeships or the labour market. 
                     In Denmark and Finland, education is guaranteed for any child only until the age of 16, leaving 
                     older asylum-seeking children with uncertain access to mechanisms for integration and 
                               168 Children’s legal entitlement to education beyond basic education is unclear in the

                     Nordic region, although asylum-seeking children are supported to attend upper secondary 
                     school. Local authorities in Finland may provide education to persons other than those in 
                     compulsory schooling, but this is not a statutory duty. The law in Iceland does not guarantee 
                     education for older children, but there is an obligation to offer training, although this is not 
                     always respected in practice; ministerial regulations clarifying access to vocational education 
                     and training are still pending. In June 2014, the Norwegian Parliament amended the Education 
                     Act to give children awaiting the processing of an asylum application the right to receive upper 
                     secondary education. Young people who remain in Norway after receiving a ifnal rejection of 
                     an application for asylum have no legal entitlement to upper secondary education, although in 
                     practice many local and regional authorities allow them access regardless of their legal status.
                     Denying young asylum seekers access to vocational training is a serious setback to young 
                     people and a breach of Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which identiifes 
                     vocational training as a formative part of a young person’s education. One serious obstacle to 
                     higher education, employment and training opportunities for refugee and migrant children 
                     is the widespread failure to formally recognize school/college certiifcates and vocational 
                     qualiifcations acquired in their countries of origin. 
                     The analysis of the Phase I study indicates that Finland has no legal procedure for validating 
                     a child’s previous education, although previous education is documented during the 
                     development of the child’s individual care plan. Accreditation mechanisms are available in 
                     Iceland, though these are not yet speciifed in the Asylum Act or in ministerial regulations. 
                     In Norway, the accreditation process is complex and the onus is on the student to supply 
                     the required evidence to enable access to upper secondary education. In Sweden, it is the 
                     school’s responsibility to assess a child’s educational capacity and previous experience, and 
                     this can involve moving the child between classes before ifnding the right ift. Given its global

                     Asylum seekers are guaranteed access to emergency health care in all of the Nordic countries, 
                     but the range of services included under emergency health care varies across the region. An 
                     individual’s legal status may also restrict access to general mother and child health services in 
                     the Nordic states. Under EU law, member countries must provide refugee and asylum-seeking 
                     children with access to appropriate health care, on an equal basis as nationals, but this care

                     2.6 Child protection
                     General context
                     In the migration/asylum discourse, ‘protection’ is “a concept that encompasses all activities 
                     aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of the individual in accordance with the letter 
                                                                                                       188 in child rights 
                     and spirit of human rights, refugee and international humanitarian law”;
                     language, ‘child protection’ usually refers to the child’s right to be free from violence – deifned 
                     as all forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence. This mismatch can lead to different 
                     standards and criteria being applied when asylum and child protection authorities assess the 
                     risks to, or vulnerability of, asylum-seeking children, and may enable the use of measures and 
                     procedures that fail to support, or actively weaken, children’s protective environment. 
                     Under international and European law, states must take measures to ensure that all children 
                     have adequate protection and that their rights to physical integrity and dignity are effectively 
                     observed. States’ precise duties are more evident where children are under their authority, 
                     supervision or care, e.g. in public institutions, and may prove more dififcult to observe in 
                     cases where children are exposed to violence by private actors. In all cases,  a state’s core duty 
                     is to secure the effective protection of all children living within its territory, and to that end, 
                                                                                                      189
                     states must adopt special measures and safeguards to protect all children.
                     Even where no speciifc violence against refugee and/or migrant children has been recorded 
                     and they live in stable family environments, pre-existing trauma, language and cultural 
                     barriers, and the breakdown of traditional community safeguarding mechanisms weaken their 
                     protective environment, leaving refugee and migrant children at greater risk of exposure to 
                     abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence. Such risks are intensiifed among children who lack 
                     proper identity documents, and/or are separated from their families and/or cannot access 
                     basic services such as education and health care, and so unaccompanied and undocumented 
                     children are particularly vulnerable. Girls are at even greater risk as they may be isolated 
                     or stigmatized by their families or communities as a result of having experienced sexual 
                     exploitation during their journeys. Although UASC in the Nordic countries are generally 
                     referred to the national child protection agency at some stage, referral is not automatic, 
                     immediate or direct, and sometimes the documentation is incomplete. In Denmark, asylum-
                     seeking children’s entitlement to child protection services has only been clariifed recently, 
                                                                                        190

                     asylum seekers cannot access homeless shelters, and fears of detention, deportation or 
                     asylum being refused if they report violence, all serve to trap asylum seekers in situations of 
                                                                                    192 
                     labour exploitation and/or domestic/community violence.          Their reluctance to report violence 
                     or seek protection or redress makes asylum seekers ‘zero risk’ victims, and breeds a culture 
                     of impunity. The ifrewall between child protection and migration/asylum agencies must be 
                     legally, administratively and practically explicit, so that migrant and refugee women and 
                     children feel able to access protection services. 
                     Guardianship
                     National law in all the Nordic countries stipulates for every unaccompanied asylum-seeking 
                     child the mandatory appointment of either a guardian or a legal representative, whose primary 
                     function is to protect the child’s best interests. There is considerable overlap between the two 
                     roles, although a guardian generally has a wider mandate in relation to the child’s general 
                                                                                                           193 while a legal 
                     welfare and acts “in the same way that a parent represents his or her child”,
                                                                                                           194 
                     representative usually has a narrower focus on the asylum application process.           There seems 
                     to be signiifcant variation in how either role is interpreted at the local level, however, and this 
                     can work in the child’s favour or to her/his disadvantage.
                     Finland, Iceland and Norway each appear to appoint legal representatives, while Denmark 
                     tends more towards a guardianship model. Sweden ensures that a child has access to both 
                     sources of support. Finland appoints a legal representative for every unaccompanied child as 
                     soon as possible after arrival. The reception centre to which the child is assigned nominates the 
                     representative, who must then be approved by the local administrative court. Reception centres 
                     maintain lists of ‘suitable’ candidates and the Finnish Immigration Service pays appointed 
                     representatives. This raises questions about the independence of such representatives and 
                     how well they can represent the child’s best interests as a result. Such concerns may also be 
                     warranted in Norway, where key respondents indicated that children’s ‘representatives’, who 
                                                                                                                          195

                     Iceland does not have a formal guardianship service but refers UASC to foster parents. The 
                     Icelandic Ombudsman for Children reported, however, that, “it is not very common that children 
                     over the age of 15 go into foster families”, revealing that a child’s age inlfuences the system’s

                               196 
                     response.    In Denmark, local authorities must appoint a guardian for any unaccompanied 
                                                                                    197 A guardian is expected to act in 
                     child, but only after she or he has been granted asylum.
                     loco parentis and to maintain custody of the child until the child either reaches the age of 18 
                     or is reunited with her/his parent or guardian. A guardian is appointed by the regional state 
                     administration at the request of the Danish Immigration Service, but must be independent of 
                     any authorities responsible for the child’s case. 
                     Sweden’s guardianship model seems more effective than most, in that guardians are integrated 
                     in the child protection system. Once a child’s application for asylum has been registered by 
                     the Swedish Migration Agency, its application unit applies to the municipality where the child 
                     will stay for a legal guardian, and the municipality’s supervisory authority appoints the child’s 
                     legal guardian. The guardian role in Sweden involves: supporting the child with her or his 
                     asylum application and contact with the Swedish Migration Agency; assisting the child in 
                     her or his contact with the local council and health care authorities; applying for ifnancial 
                     support; ensuring that the child receives an education; managing the child’s ifnancial assets; 
                     and representing the child and providing support more generally. Another major challenge 
                     in Sweden is the variation in qualiifcations of the guardian. The formal qualiifcation is very 
                     broadly deifned in the national legislation, leading to a wide variety in quality of the guardian’s 
                     performance.
                     The scale of demand for guardians over the past three years has inevitably proved problematic 
                     for guardianship services, especially in Finland and Sweden. One problem that has resulted 
                                                                                                                        198 
                     stems from the absence of a cap on the number of children a single guardian may support.
                     This has led to guardians taking on responsibility for far more children than they can care for 
                                                                                                                        199
                     properly, which has resulted in children being neglected and missing out on information.
                     There is a need within the Nordic countries to develop a guardianship model that ensures that 
                     children have access to supporters in both roles – legal representative and guardian. Norway 
                     has already gone some way towards this, by incorporating both roles in a single position, but 
                     this is just one of several possible models that could be embraced. Further examination is 
                     also required of the protocols in place to ensure that representatives operate independently 
                     of asylum authorities, and it would seem that access to free legal aid is a prerequisite for 
                     both child and guardian to negotiate the asylum application process. It is therefore imperative 
                     that neither guardian nor representative is perceived as the sole and sufifcient support 
                     for unaccompanied children. Since the guardian and/or representative functions as the 
                     unaccompanied child’s primary source of support throughout the asylum process, there 
                     is an urgent need to ensure that anyone occupying either role is both independent and 
                     competent, perhaps through the development of a common set of standards. The nature 
                     of the contractual relationship between adult and child – particularly in terms of the adult 
                     striking a balance between speaking for the child and representing the child’s own views – 
                     also requires clariifcation. Although children in the Nordic countries can complain about their 
                     guardians, it is not apparent that they have any real say in their guardian’s appointment.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Family contact and reuniifcation 
                     The Nordic states generally respect the child’s right to live with her or his family and facilitate 
                     this as far as possible. Placement with family members is considered the most suitable option 
                     for unaccompanied children in all ifve countries, and family tracing is initiated as soon as 
                     possible. Most reception centres maintain phone and Internet facilities to facilitate contact 
                     between the child and family members. As indicated earlier, however, none of the Nordic 
                     countries have signed or ratiifed the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
                     of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, though this could strengthen a state’s 
                     commitment to family reuniifcation, and there are concerns that family reuniifcation is 
                     sometimes used as a justiifcation for detention or return, without full and proper consideration 
                     of the individual child’s best interests.
                     Key respondents note that family reuniifcation has become more dififcult. In Finland, child-
                     sensitive legislation has been weakened and it is more dififcult to obtain a residence permit,

                     children.201 The rules for family reuniifcation have also been tightened under the ‘temporary

                     residence but not the right to family reuniifcation.203
                     In Finland, family tracing is not compulsory and the child’s decision on the matter seems to 
                     be taken into account. The child’s consent to family tracing is required in all ifve countries, 
                     but it is possible to override this requirement in Denmark and Norway. It is important that 
                     the child’s opinions on family tracing are given serious consideration, particularly since 
                     the ifndings of a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) study suggest that 
                                                                                              204 FRA research has also

                    Detention 
                    In February 2018, the Committee on the Rights of the Child made a strong call for the EU to 
                    ban child immigration detention, “even as a last resort” and for the reform of the Common 
                                                                                            206

                    European Asylum System. In their recent Joint general comment,
                    Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
                    and Members of Their Families reassert the basic principle that every child, at all times, has 
                    a fundamental right to liberty and freedom from immigration detention. The Committee on 
                    the Rights of the Child has previously asserted that the detention of children because of their 
                    own or a parent’s migration status constitutes a child rights violation and contravenes the best 
                                        207 In the joint statement of November 2017, both Committees repeatedly 
                    interests principle.
                    afifrm that children should never be detained for reasons related to their own or a parent’s 
                    migration status, and also that states should expeditiously and completely cease or eradicate 
                    the immigration detention of children. 
                    National law in all ifve Nordic states should forbid any kind of immigration detention for 
                    children, and this prohibition should be fully implemented in practice. The Committees 
                    emphasize in their joint statement the harm inherent in any deprivation of liberty and the 
                    negative impact that immigration detention can have on children’s physical and mental health 
                    and on their development, even when they are detained only for a short period of time or with 
                    their families. The Council of Europe has also clariifed that detention can never be justiifed as 
                    being in a child’s best interests, and several cases before the European Court of Human Rights 
                    have highlighted the illegality of detaining children, even when a child is accompanied by her

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     Implementing regulations are insufifcient in 
                     all of the Nordic countries. The criteria used             Although legislation and policies in 
                     to determine and enable detention are quite                the Nordic states generally restrict

                     as a result detention is more common in 
                                                                                particularly for those awaiting return. It

                     kind. This means that even when ‘detention’                as juvenile criminal justice, is not 
                                                                                applicable in immigration proceedings

                     unaccompanied asylum-seeking children can 
                     be, and are, held in special detention facilities. Also, an older child may be taken into detention 
                     if the receiving authority denies the fact that the child is under age. 
                     In Norway, arresting anyone under 18 years of age is prohibited under section 174 of the 
                     Criminal Procedure Act unless it is absolutely necessary, but the detention of children is 
                     allowed for immigration control purposes. In Denmark, child asylum seekers, whether 
                     accompanied or unaccompanied, may only be detained in special facilities, but in the absence 
                                                                                                              209 
                     of any alternative option, children aged 15–17 years can be placed in a local prison.       In Iceland, 
                     there are no detention centres and children are not detained for immigration purposes. 
                     The other four Nordic states allow the detention of children for return purposes, and the 
                     criteria used to justify and enable detention are quite broad and usually relate more to easing 
                     the implementation of an asylum authority’s decision than to protecting the child’s best 
                     interests. National law across the region generally prohibits the detention of children under 
                     the age of 18, but younger children may be detained if accompanied by a parent. 
                     Time limits placed on the duration of a child’s detainment also seem somewhat elastic in the 
                     Nordic countries. A European Migration Network report on unaccompanied minors in the EU 
                     indicates that asylum-seeking children may only be detained for a maximum of 72 hours in 
                     Finland and Sweden, but that this can be legally extended for another 72 hours – meaning

                     to missing children as they do with detained 
                     children. None of the three Nordic states 
                     included in the Ecorys study – Denmark, Finland and Sweden – have either a legal deifnition 
                     of ‘missing person’ or a full database of the 14 indicators of missing children suggested by 
                     Missing Children Europe. Inconsistent policy and/or practice across the ifve Nordic countries 
                     is particularly damaging in the case of missing children, as such children’s movement is likely 
                     to remain within the Nordic region and so cross-border cooperation will be important for 
                     resolution and return. 
                     Only Sweden has a legal deifnition of a ‘missing unaccompanied child’, and this aligns with the 
                     Missing Children Europe deifnition. Finland’s deifnition of the same is enshrined in ministerial 
                     regulations only, while Denmark has no legal deifnition and relies instead on an operational 
                     deifnition used by the police. Of the ifve countries, only Finland has clear legal and procedural 
                     regulations that set out how to respond when an asylum-seeking child goes missing. The 
                     absence of speciifc regulations on responding to missing unaccompanied migrant children in 
                     Denmark leaves local police without guidelines for undertaking related search procedures. A 
                     case can only be identiifed as a ‘missing child’ if criminal activity is suspected, at which point it 
                     is passed to the national police and a national criminal record is created. Although the absence 
                     of a prescribed ‘immediate response’ should not be taken to assume that no effort is being

                     commence for missing unaccompanied migrant children over 15 years of age. In Finland, there 
                     is also a waiting period of 24 hours before a police search for a missing child is initiated. 
                     In contrast, Sweden has mapped missing children in the country and developed an action plan 
                     that sets out how the relevant authorities and other national and local actors can coordinate 
                     efforts and work together when a child goes missing.219
                     Although reception centre staff in Norway will immediately investigate why an unaccompanied 
                     child is absent from daily activities or has not returned from an external appointment, they 
                     will delay notifying the police for 24 hours. Even then, local police and child welfare services 
                     will be notiifed of a disappearance only if the staff have reason to believe that the minor may 
                     be a victim of trafifcking, at risk of forced marriage, or involved in a criminal environment, or 
                     may have been exposed to other gross neglect. On the other hand, reception centre staff will 
                     immediately report a disappearance to the UDI Arrival and Child Specialist units and register 
                     the missing minor in Sesam, a web-based database of missing children, as soon as possible. 
                     UDI then coordinates the response. Although a 2013 study notes that Norwegian police no 
                     longer take cases of missing unaccompanied migrant children less seriously than missing 
                                     220 a more recent Save the Children report indicates that 470 children were 
                     local children,
                     missing from the asylum system in Norway as at 31 October 2017.221

                     national rapporteur on trafifcking, the Finnish government initially appointed the Ombudsman 
                     for Minorities to serve as its National Rapporteur on Trafifcking in Human Beings in January

                     as irregular migrants. 
                     While robustly defending the need to ensure that children who have been trafifcked can access 
                     appropriate services, the 2011 UNICEF Innocenti research previously mentioned in this report 
                     did point out that privileging this group of vulnerable children on the basis of their legal status 
                     over other groups of vulnerable migrant children whose rights are not fully met appears to 
                                                          228
                     represent a form of discrimination.     This research ifnds that this tension is yet to be resolved 
                     in the Nordic countries in relation to asylum-seeking children.

                     recommendations
                     3.1 Conclusion 
                     The response of Nordic countries to the arrival of asylum-seeking children continues to be 
                     both generous and child-friendly. The size, scale and scope of the movement of UASC have, 
                     however, challenged the capacity of professionals and agencies working in the national asylum 
                     and child protection systems and have revealed inherent lfaws, cracks and gaps in national 
                     response frameworks. Despite the Nordic countries having social and political environments 
                     that are by and large respectful of children’s rights, national child protection agencies have 
                     failed to take a strong lead in relation to migrant and asylum-seeking children. National 
                     asylum agencies and their agents have generally tried to adopt a child-focused approach, but 
                     child rights are not their primary remit, and national responses have been framed in a context 
                     where a child’s legal status signiifcantly determines her or his access to entitlements. 
                     As a result, national responses in the Nordic region do not comply with the Committee on 
                     the Rights of the Child recommendations that every child, whatever her or his migration or 
                     asylum status, is ifrst and foremost a child with full entitlement to all of the rights enshrined 
                     in the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and that all governments and duty bearers have 
                                                                                                                    229
                                                                                                                        The 
                     a moral and legal responsibility to realize those rights for all children in their care.
                     current imbalance in authority and responsibility between asylum and child protection agencies 
                     must be recalibrated, as it enables the continuation of a situation in which lower standards are 
                     tolerated for asylum-seeking children. This leaves thousands of asylum-seeking children relying 
                     on second-rate mechanisms for protection – mechanisms that do not satisfactorily comply with 
                     the standards laid down by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. National child protection 
                     agencies in the Nordic region must take a more active leadership role in the design, development, 
                     supervision and oversight of national migration, asylum and dispersal strategies and actions. 
                     Further investment is also needed in child advocacy, protection and support programmes, and 
                     in developing appropriate oversight, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for such initiatives. 
                     There is a clear tendency in all ifve countries to give migration law precedence over the 
                     Convention on the Rights of the Child, even in those countries where the Convention has been 
                     incorporated into national law. Nordic states should consider strengthening their legislative 
                     and policy frameworks by ratifying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
                     of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which will also serve to encourage other 
                     European states to follow suit. All ifve Nordic countries should also give serious consideration 
                     to committing fully to the EU migration acquis, which establishes a practical framework for the 
                     development across Europe of common policies, practice and standards for asylum-seeking 
                     children. Although the Nordic states have a strong culture and institutional framework of 
                     gender equality, the present research found no documented evidence of gender awareness 
                     229  Report of the 2012 Day of General Discussion on the Rights of All Children.
                                                                       74

             being incorporated in national responses to asylum-seeking children. Nor did the research 
             ifnd sufifcient justiifcation for the variation in the levels and types of protection offered to 
             children above and below the age of 15. 
             To facilitate both a child focus and equivalence, safeguards related to the asylum process 
             should, as far as possible, be stipulated in law rather than in rules and regulations or codes 
             of conduct. Safeguards at regulation and practice levels are essential throughout the asylum 
             process, but their stipulation only at these levels allows too much room for wide interpretation 
             and lax enforcement, often to children’s detriment. Much stronger safeguards are required 
             at every stage of the asylum process to allow a child legal challenge and judicial review of 
             decisions. Age assessment and forced return are two speciifc stages of the asylum process 
             that demand much greater scrutiny, but in fact the whole concept of ‘manifestly unnecessary’ 
             must be strongly challenged when it comes to decisions that affect children’s lives. 
             The ‘best interests of the child’ must be the primary consideration in any and all decisions 
             that affect a child, and the core principle underpinning safeguards in all countries and at 
             all stages of the asylum process. It is worrying to note the great variation in the quality of 
             understanding, interpretation and implementation of the principle within and between the 
             Nordic states. While some BIDs genuinely aim to plan holistically for a child’s welfare and 
             protection, key respondents indicated that, in practice, the quality of BIDs is mixed and their 
             impact on decision-making variable. It is particularly urgent and essential that all ifve states 
             establish clear formats, protocols and standards for BIAs – and ensure that these are applied 
             appropriately and consistently – to ensure that a child’s best interests do inform and inlfuence 
             every stage of the asylum process. 
             Guardianship is another key safeguarding mechanism in the Nordic states, but there is no 
             agreement on models or standards and practical implementation is inconsistent. This is an 
             area that could beneift from regional agreement on standards and a common code of good 
             practice to ensure that: (i) both guardianship and legal representation are available to every 
             child; (ii) there is an explicit and sufifcient ifrewall between guardians and asylum services; and 
             (iii) there are clear guidelines in place relating to conifdentiality and to disputes or differences 
             between guardian and child, the child’s right to speak for herself or himself, and the child’s 
             right to complain about her or his guardian. National child protection agencies should also 
             establish standards, and clear procedures, for the vetting, recruitment, management, support, 
             supervision, training and resourcing of guardians. 
             The Nordic states have a deserved reputation for respecting children’s right to be heard 
             on matters that affect them and asylum procedures relfect this – though not sufifciently. In 
             practice, asylum-seeking childen – and especially accompanied children – are given only limited 
             opportunities to be heard. It is the needs of the asylum system that generally determine the 
             timing and agenda of a child’s participation, rather than her or his own concerns, and so the 
             child’s input tends to be sporadic, indirect and not always heard at key points in the process. 
             There also seems to be a lot of leeway in the asylum process for adults to arbitrarily decide to 
             deny – without consultation or justiifcation – children the opportunity to speak. Strengthening, 
             extending and realizing the right of every child to have her or his opinions noted and acted 
             upon throughout the asylum process, must be central to any strategy aiming to strengthen 
             implementation of the ‘best interests’ principle.

       Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
             The Nordic countries have strong education systems and the right to basic education for all 
             children is enshrined in law in every country. The law seems to be interpreted differently for 
             asylum-seeking children in each of the Nordic states, however, and there also seems to be 
             variation in how local authorities interpret their responsibilities towards this group of children. 
             Education services in the Nordic states have generally coped with the large number of refugee 
             children who have arrived since 2015, and their national models of inclusive education have 
             proved ift for purpose. Certain legal and administrative barriers can, however, signiifcantly and 
             unnecessarily delay a child’s entry into mainstream schooling, and restrict her or his access 
             to the full range of education services. Delaying the enrolment of asylum-seeking children 
             into compulsory schooling is frequently justiifed as a protective measure, although there 
             is no evidence that the alternative educational services offered are effective, cost-efifcient 
             or sufifcient for children’s needs. Strengthening schools’ capacity to provide the additional 
             resources, teaching and support services needed to address the language barriers and other 
             obstacles that hinder child asylum seekers’ access to education would seem to be more 
             effective and cost-efifcient than delaying their enrolment by trying to address such matters 
             outside the mainstream education system. This is particularly the case for ECE programmes, 
             but the same approach also applies to basic, secondary and vocational education. To speed 
             up the integration of asylum-seeking children in mainstream education, there should be a 
             signiifcant reassignment of resources from segregated education services based in reception 
             centres to support services in mainstream schools. 
             Different standards also seem to apply to asylum seekers in relation to access to health care 
             and social protection services. Although asylum-seeking children are entitled to health care 
             and medical treatment, local health care services can be reluctant to offer such care, and the 
             ifrewalls between health care and asylum services are insufifcient. Neither law nor policy 
             allows for child asylum seekers’ full integration in national health services, so access must be 
             negotiated on a service-by-service basis – and sometimes even treatment by treatment. This 
             seems ineffective for all parties and it is strongly advised that the Nordic states instead deifne 
             a common ‘core package’ of services available to asylum-seeking mothers and children, and 
             make this information available to both them and to practitioners at the local level. This would 
             ensure a consistent interpretation of national law and policy across a country. Ideally, this 
             package should be equal to the package available to all mothers and children in the country, 
             but at a minimum it should include free access to national services for mother and child 
             health, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS, vaccination, 
             adolescent health, dental care and mental health, as well as emergency medical treatment 
             and care. Research and experience indicate that the mental health of child asylum seekers 
             is severely affected by uncertainty about their legal status and the constraints of their living 
             conditions, and also that the asylum process itself is a major contributor to poor mental health 
             among asylum-seeking children, youth and young people. All ifve Nordic states must adopt a 
             proactive and inclusive ‘normalizing’ strategy towards child asylum seekers to address mental 
             health issues and to ensure a more positive living environment for everyone in the asylum 
             process, particularly adolescents and young people.

                                                        Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                    Immigration detention is more common in the Nordic region than it should be, and research 
                    is urgently needed in all of the Nordic countries to establish the real situation as regards 
                    detained children. The lack of data about children in detention in the Nordic states is a matter of 
                    some concern, and it raises serious questions about accountability and also the policymaking 
                    process in relation to detained children. Loopholes in the policy frameworks allow for too many 
                    instances of detention outside the recommended guidelines. The recent joint statement from 
                    the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights 
                    of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families clariifes that the use of immigration 
                    detention for children in any circumstances and for any period of time is a clear breach of the 
                    Convention on the Rights of the Child and a serious risk to the child’s heath, well-being and 
                    development. The clariifcation provided by the joint statement clearly invalidates the legal 
                    justiifcation for such detention in the Nordic region. National campaigns to prohibit all forms 
                    of immigration detention for children are now required, as is further investment in developing 
                    alternatives to the detainment of children. It is particularly important that the aim to ‘keep 
                    families together’ ceases to be used to justify detaining children. 
                    A similar lack of data also makes it dififcult to comment on the Nordic countries’ responses to 
                    children missing from the asylum system. What is clear, however, is that Nordic states lack the 
                    comprehensive and coherent legislative, policy and practice frameworks required to shape the 
                    kind of well-coordinated, multi-sectoral responses that this issue demands. The impression 
                    that comes across is that agencies and professionals in the region have come to accept the 
                    disappearance of asylum-seeking children – especially older boys – as inevitable, and they 
                    have downgraded the intensity of their responses accordingly. Each of the Nordic countries 
                    should measure its national response against the template developed by Missing Children 
                    Europe and upgrade its processes and procedures as necessary. This would be best done in a 
                    coordinated way across the region, given the transnational nature of this issue. 
                    The large number of arrivals since 2015 has undoubtedly led to a blurring of distinctions 
                    across Europe between refugees and economic migrants and this has inevitably diluted public 
                    perception of children’s need for refuge, asylum and protection. There has been a backlash 
                                                                                                                 230
                                                                                                                     A 
                    against unaccompanied children and perceived abuse of the age assessment process.
                    much stronger lead is required from child protection agencies to reinforce the message 
                    that children are children, whatever their legal status. The sheer scale of demand may make 
                    it dififcult to maintain child-centred policy and practice at all times, but child protection 
                    agencies’ continued tolerance of lower standards for asylum-seeking children contributes 
                    to a social acceptance of discrimination and marginalization. The notion that full access to 
                    rights for any child depends on her or his legal status must be vigorously challenged.

                1. Realign and restate the current balance of responsibility and authority between national 
                  asylum and child protection agencies in all the Nordic states to ensure that all children 
                  are treated equally and that asylum-seeking children do not have to rely on second-rate 
                  protection and care mechanisms that do not sufifciently and satisfactorily comply with the 
                  standards laid down by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, for both unaccompanied 
                  and accompanied children. 
                2. Restate the primacy of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, over migration/asylum 
                  law, and make explicit the consequent commitment to apply the same rules and standards 
                  to asylum-seeking children that apply to all other children, for whatever period they remain 
                  in country. 
                3. Develop a common model for BIA and for BID, along with clear guidelines for the 
                  implementation and use of each in asylum proceedings. 
                b. Asylum process
                1. Ensure that law, policy and practice stipulate the referral to child protection authorities of 
                  all asylum-seeking children immediately upon arrival, and that such a referral becomes an 
                  integral element of the registration process.
                2. Develop a protocol for age assessment that covers procedures, techniques and the 
                  interpretation of results, and that is in line with both sets of United Nations guidelines 
                  (UNICEF and UNHCR) and also the safeguards outlined by the European Asylum Support 
                  Ofifce. Immediately cease the practice of penalizing children in any way, or threatening 
                  penalties, for refusing to consent to age assessment, and put in place an independent 
                  appeals process that allows children to challenge age assessment decisions.
                3.  Put in place a child-sensitive asylum procedure that guarantees the child’s right to be heard 
                  in the asylum process and ensures that every child has access to legal advice at all stages 
                  of the process.

                c. Education
                1. Remove all barriers to asylum-seeking children’s rapid enrolment and full inclusion in 
                  mainstream schools and ECE programmes. 
                2. Reassign resources from the provision of reception-based education services to the 
                  expansion of support services in mainstream schools to speed up the integration of asylum-
                  seeking children in mainstream education. In countries where ECE programmes for asylum-
                  seeking children are run in reception centres, ensure that such programmes are transferred 
                  to mainstream facilities in the community.
                d. Health
                1.  Ensure that access to equal health care, including mental health care, for all asylum-seeking 
                  children serves to integrate asylum seekers into mainstream national health systems, in 
                  countries where relevant.
                2.  Develop a strategy to address the risk to children’s mental health presented by the continued 
                  stress and social isolation caused by their poor living conditions, uncertain legal status and 
                  exclusion from mainstream services.
                e. Child protection
                1.  For all child protection facilities and services, eliminate any residence requirement for users 
                  of services, to ensure that they are accessible to asylum-seeking women and children when 
                  needed.
                2.  Revise guardianship services and establish a code of good practice to ensure that both 
                  guardianship and legal representation are available to every asylum-seeking child 
                  immediately upon arrival. Ensure the presence of an explicit and sufifcient ifrewall between 
                  the immigration/asylum authority and each of the following: guardians, social services, and 
                  educational and health services.
                3.  Cooperate with the other Nordic countries to develop and implement models to prevent 
                  children absconding from the asylum system and to quickly trace and recover those children 
                  who do go missing. 
                4.  Expand the range of options available for the reception and care of asylum-seeking children, 
                  and establish a multi-sectoral plan in collaboration with each child (and family, where 
                  relevant). Upgrade the standards and level of care in all residential facilities for asylum-
                  seeking children in line with the requirements applied to residential facilities for other 
                  vulnerable children in the country.

                            Ethical safeguards
                            Prior to data collection 
                            Research purpose and design: 
                            �    This research project has been developed by UNICEF Ofifce of Research – Innocenti and 
                                 the UNICEF National Committees (NatComs) in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, 
                                 Iceland, Norway and Sweden) in line with the UNICEF Procedure for Ethical Standards in 
                                 Research. The project’s purpose is to strengthen safeguards for children going through the 
                                 asylum process in the Nordic countries.
                            �    Overall management of the project lies with Bina D’Costa (UNICEF Ofifce of Research 
                                 – Innocenti) and the research is being managed and supervised by two experienced 
                                 researchers, Kevin Byrne and Claus Bech Hansen. 
                            �    An initial review of the asylum processes and related legislation in the Nordic countries 
                                 has already been undertaken pro bono by DLA Piper. The research methodologies will 
                                 include comparative analysis of the DLA Piper material, a review of the relevant literature, 
                                 and semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) with key in-country 
                                 respondents. UNICEF Innocenti and the Nordic NatComs will partake in the development 
                                 of data collection methods and processes. It is also the aim to seek input from children and 
                                 adolescents who are currently in the asylum process or have recently been through it. The 
                                 project’s management and researchers are willing to present the research framework to 
                                 an internal or external ethics committee to ensure that safeguards are upheld in relation to 
                                 the collection of data from children. 
                            Research subjects: 
                            �    Each of the NatComs will take responsibility for identifying key respondents in their 
                                 respective countries and facilitating FGDs and data collection. The researchers will seek 
                                 to maximize children’s input by reviewing existing research studies. In addition, two FGDs 
                                 with asylum-seeking children aged 12–18 years are envisaged. These will take place in 
                                 locations with which the children are familiar, and in a language they understand and 
                                 are comfortable with. Interpreters experienced in communication with children will be 
                                 employed if necessary. 
                                                                                               96
                                                                                             Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                                 Qualiifcation and training of researchers and facilitators: 
                                 �     The researchers will seek to work with groups of children – balanced in terms of age, 
                                       gender, nationality and legal status – who already know one another and are preferably 
                                       familiar with the FGD format. As the time available for training or piloting is limited, each 
                                       FGD will be run by an experienced facilitator already familiar with the group and lfuent in 
                                       its various languages. The facilitator will be provided with consent forms, questionnaires, 
                                       discussion points and any other tools required, and will be supported appropriately 
                                       by the researchers and the relevant NatCom. Kevin will provide overall quality control 
                                       and oversight of the process. He is an experienced researcher with speciifc expertise 
                                       in facilitating and supporting child-led research, and involving children in research and 
                                       advocacy. His experience includes the design, management and implementation of 
                                       research; the development of age-appropriate tools and techniques; and the provision of 
                                       training to facilitators, co-leaders and recorders. 
                                 During data collection 
                                 Information sharing: 
                                 �     Children will be thoroughly informed about the purpose of the research; how the FGDs will 
                                       contribute to the research and how the children’s input will be used; the types of questions 
                                       they will be asked; the length of the interviews or FGDs; the anonymity of respondents 
                                       and, in case of FGDs, the conifdentiality of responses; participants’ rights to referral and 
                                       complaint mechanisms; and the fact that respondents will not be remunerated for their 
                                       participation.
                                 Assent and consent: 
                                 �     Child and legal guardian will be asked verbally for their consent to attend the FGD. Following 
                                       thorough information sharing in situ, the child will be asked for her/his written agreement 
                                       to participate, and written consent will be requested of the guardian too, if present. It will 
                                       be made clear to participants that they are not obliged to respond to all questions, and that 
                                       they may withdraw at any time. It is not the intention to photograph any child respondent 
                                       and no additional consent format has been developed for this purpose. Where a facilitator 
                                       wishes to record the session, explicit permission to do so will be sought from participants. 
                                                                                                                97

                                 �     Each NatCom will put in place referral and complaint mechanisms to ensure that 
                                       participants can decline further participation in the project or submit complaints about the 
                                       way the research is conducted.
                                 Vulnerable respondents: 
                                 �     The project recognizes the high probability that all child participants are likely to be 
                                       vulnerable, and will ensure that the vulnerability of individual participants is recognized 
                                       and taken into account in the research process. The project will not target especially 
                                       vulnerable children as respondents. 
                                 Safe and conifdential space: 
                                 �     To ensure the protection of participants, data collection will only take place where a safe 
                                       and private space for interviews and/or FGDs can be identiifed. The location should include 
                                       a space for participants who choose to withdraw from discussions, and snacks and drinks 
                                       should be made available to all participants.

                     Annex 2. Research framework: 
                     A child rights-based approach 
                     a. Terminology
                     One of the key differences that distinguishes the migration/asylum approach from a child 
                     rights-based approach is its tendency to deifne the child primarily by her or his legal status 
                     and to assign entitlement to rights and access to services according to the child’s place in 
                     the asylum process, rather than on the basis of the individual child’s needs. This is often 
                     relfected in the deifnitions and terminology used – migrant, refugee, returnee, beneifciary 
                     of international protection, unaccompanied minor, etc. In line with the recommendations 
                     of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, this report takes the perspective that every 
                     child, whatever her or his migration or asylum status, is ifrst and foremost a child with full 
                     entitlement to all of the rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and 
                     that all governments and duty bearers have a moral and legal responsibility to realize those 
                                                           231
                     rights for all children in their care.    
                     In the absence of a suitable term – agreed across both the migration/asylum and child rights 
                     discourses – that emphasizes the child rather than her or his legal status, the present research 
                     uses the term ‘asylum-seeking child(ren)’ throughout. This term relates explicitly to the brief 
                     for the research, but also takes account of the fact that all migrant children are dealt with 
                     under asylum legislation in the Nordic region. Thus, unless otherwise speciifed, the term 
                     ‘asylum-seeking children’ refers to all migrant and refugee children in country. In line with the 
                     Convention, the term ‘child’ in this research refers to anyone under 18 years of age, whether 
                     accompanied or unaccompanied, unless otherwise speciifed. Although the report refers 
                     occasionally to ‘child asylum seeker’, ‘refugee children’ or ‘migrant children’, other terms such 
                     as ‘foreigner’, ‘alien’, ‘third country national’ or ‘unaccompanied minor’ are used only when 
                     quoting directly from national legislation or other sources. 
                     b. Sources
                     Primary data were obtained through a series of semi-structured interviews with key informants 
                     in the region. The regional expert conducted a total of 29 interviews during a ifeld visit 
                     that took in all ifve countries between 21 October and 10 November 2017. UNICEF National 
                     Committees (NatComs) in the Nordic region originally proposed lists of potential interviewees 
                     in country. These were assessed in light of their potential value as key respondents. As the 
                     matrix of indicators was developed, each list was revised and expanded, particularly to include 
                     representatives of the police and child protection services. The consultant devised a schedule 
                     of interviews across the region, based on respondents’ availability and the logistics of travel,

                                                                        99

                     and this was agreed with the NatCom representative who facilitated travel, translation and 
                     logistics in each country. 
                     Secondary data were drawn from a review of the literature on refugees and migrants in Europe 
                     and in the Nordic states. The main focus was on European databases and on research and 
                     studies conducted post-2014, although earlier research was also reviewed where considered 
                     relevant. There was inevitably a data imbalance between European Union (EU) member 
                     countries and non-member countries, as non-members are excluded from Eurostat and other 
                     vital databases. The data gap was particularly severe in relation to Iceland, which is not an EU 
                     member country, but participation across the region in cross-country studies was generally 
                     inconsistent anyway, regardless of EU status. Most research studies, whether EU-sponsored 
                     or independent, have focused on speciifc issues or categories of children, rather than on 
                     asylum-seeking children per se, with the majority examining the situation of unaccompanied 
                     and separated children. Although much of the decision-making around asylum-seeking 
                     children occurs at the local level, the research team lacked the resources to systematically 
                     trawl through the relevant literature at local authority level, although some local evaluations 
                     were reviewed.
                      
                     c. Analytical framework
                     The research was not expected to identify major inconsistencies between national and 
                     regional/international legislation, but rather focus on implementation, enforcement and 
                     practice on the ground, so as to provide concrete and constructive recommendations to the 
                     Nordic governments. While acknowledging that procedural safeguards are crucial as a means 
                     of ensuring that the rights of asylum-seeking children are translated into meaningful practice, 
                     the initial legal analyses indicated that such safeguards could not on their own guarantee 
                     the full protection of children’s rights, and that a range of factors operating at various levels 
                     can either support or impede the practical realization of children’s rights on the ground. The 
                     research focus therefore moved beyond the simple identiifcation of procedural safeguards (or 
                     lack thereof) to conduct a wider analysis of practice on the ground.
                     It was crucial to adopt a child rights lens through which to assess law, policy and practice 
                     across a spectrum of domains related to asylum-seeking children. Using the Convention 
                     on the Rights of the Child deifnition of a child rights-based approach as a foundation, an

                     analytical framework  was adopted from the Council of Europe based on how the four 
                     principles underlying the Convention (non-discrimination; best interests; right to life, survival 
                     and development; and child participation) translate into practice on the ground. It sets the 
                     parameters of any assessment of policies, strategies, actions or activities in terms of how far 
                     they are:

                              (i)    Child-centred: The Committee on the Rights of the Child asserts that “a child is ifrst and 
                                                                                                                                                                                233
                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                     foremost a child, whatever the condition he or she may ifnd himself or herself in”.
                                     This implies that it is the best interestso f the individual child – rather than her or his 
                                     legal or asylum status – that should always be the primary consideration in determining 
                                     legislative, policy and service responses to asylum-seeking children, which can be subject 
                                     to rapid change even as individual children pass through the asylum system.
                              (ii)   Equivalent:  The principle of non-discrimination stipulates that all of the children in 
                                     a country should enjoy full access to their rights, irrespective of the child’s or her/his 
                                     parent’s: race; colour; sex; language; religion; political or other opinion; national, ethnic 
                                     or social origin; property; disability; birth; sexual orientation; gender identity; and legal or 
                                     other status. National authorities should therefore try to provide asylum-seeking children 
                                     with the same level of access to entitlements and services as nationals enjoy, and strive 
                                     to reduce the barriers (e.g. language, location) that restrict equal access.
                              (iii)  Inclusive: Although full integration in host communities may not be a feasible long-term 
                                     option for all asylum-seeking children, authorities should adopt an inclusive approach 
                                     towards every child for the duration of her or his stay in country, irrespective of the child’s 
                                     legal status. Ideally, national and local responses should aim to facilitate child asylum 
                                     seekers’ rapid referral to, and acceptance by, mainstream child and family services, rather 
                                     than create or support parallel systems, structures or services for this group.
                              (iv)  Participative: Involving children as far as possible in decision-making at the individual, 
                                     family, organization and policy levels is key to the full realization of their rights, and it 
                                     also enables more effective and efifcient action. Child participation involves not only 
                                     the provision of mechanisms to allow children and young people to make their opinions 
                                     heard, but also, more importantly, ensuring that due weight is given to a child’s views 
                                     when making decisions that affect her or him.

           Protected on Paper? An analysis of Nordic country responses to asylum-seeking children
                     d. Tools and techniques 
                     The detailed checklist underlying the framework was expanded further to enable a deeper 
                     analysis of the rights orientation of individual activities as well as the wider framework of 
                     response, based on the criteria of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality outlined 
                                                                                    234
                     by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.          Although the checklist does not 
                     enable quantitative measurement of every activity, responses to clusters of questions can 
                     indicate how far a speciifc activity or service adopts a rights-based approach to translating a 
                     child’s entitlements into reality. Taken together as a matrix, these responses enable evaluation 
                     of both the social, institutional, organizational and policy frameworks that determine asylum-
                     seeking children’s protective environment, and the strategic and operational practices in each 
                     country. 
                     The questions relate to ifve priority domains: general context, asylum process, education, 
                     health, and child protection. Indicators for social protection, housing and employment were 
                     not pursued due to time and resource constraints. The questions were devised in line with 
                                235
                     guidelines    and models of good practice issued by UNICEF, UNHCR, the Council of Europe, 
                     the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the European Migration Network and other relevant 
                     agencies, and adapted and expanded to facilitate the measurement of activities at operational, 
                     strategic and governance levels. Several agencies have produced or updated guidelines since 
                     2015. These have proved useful but most tend to relate to a particular issue or situation and 
                     they are not usually linked or connected to one another. The level of detail provided can also 
                     vary considerably, from general principles to quite detailed operational recommendations. 
                     Many focus only on unaccompanied children and had to be extrapolated to all asylum-seeking 
                     children.
