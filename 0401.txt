                                                  The Jungle Book
                                                         By Rudyard Kipling
                                              Suggestions and Expectations
                 This curriculum unit can be used in a variety of ways. Each chapter of the novel study focuses on
                 2-3 chapters of The Jungle Book and is comprised of five of the following different activities:
                      •   Before You Read
                      •   Vocabulary Building
                      •   Comprehension Questions
                      •   Language Activities
                      •   Extension Activities
                   Links with the Common Core Standards (U.S.)
                   Many of the activities in this unit are supported by the Common Core Standards.  For instance 
                   the Reading Standards for Literature, Grade 5, makes reference to 
                   a) determining the meaning of words and phrases. . . including figurative language; 
                   b) explaining how a series of chapters fits together to provide the overall structure;
                   c) compare and contrast two characters;
                   d) determine how characters … respond to challenges;
                   e) drawing inferences from the text;
                   f) determining a theme of a story . . . and many others. 
                 A principal expectation of the unit is that students will develop their skills in reading, writing, 
                 listening and oral communication, as well as in reasoning and critical thinking. Students will also
                 be expected to provide clear answers to questions and well-constructed explanations. It is critical
                 as well that students be able to relate events and the feelings of characters to their own lives and 
                 experiences and describe their own interpretation of a particular passage.
                 A strength of the unit is that students can work on the activities at their own pace. Every activity 
                 need not be completed by all students. A portfolio cover is included (p.7) so that students may 
                 organize their work and keep it all in one place. A Student Checklist is also included (p.6) so 
                 that a record of completed work may be recorded.
                                                                      3

                         Author Biography
                           Rudyard Kipling
         Joseph Rudyard Kipling (30 December 1865 – 18 January
         1936) was an English short-story writer, poet, and novelist. He is
         chiefly remembered for his tales and poems of British soldiers in
         India and his tales for children. He was born in Bombay, in the
         Bombay Presidency of British India, and was taken by his family
         to England when he was five years old. Kipling is best known for
         his works of fiction, including The Jungle Book (a collection of
         stories which includes "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"), Just So Stories (1902),
         Kim (1901) (a tale of adventure), many short stories, including
         "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888); and his poems, including
         "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the
         Copybook Headings" (1919), " The White Man's Burden" (1899),
         and "If_” (1910). He is regarded as a major "innovator in the art
         of the short story"; his children's books are enduring classics of
         children's literature; and his best works are said to exhibit "a
         versatile and luminous narrative gift".
