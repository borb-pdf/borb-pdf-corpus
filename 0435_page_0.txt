            Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer 
            (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) (Figure  collected from Arizona, California, 
            1), is a lfatheaded phloem- and wood              and Mexico.  In southeastern Arizona, 
                                                              GSOB feeds primarily on Q. emoryi, 
            borer that infests and kills several 
            species of oak (Fagaceae: Quercus) in             and silverleaf oak, Q. hypoleucoides A. 
                                                              Camus (both Section Lobatae).  Larval

            of GSOB were likely introduced via                feeding injures the phloem and outer 
            infested  ifrewood  into  San  Diego              xylem of these red oak species, with

            County, California from the native 
                                                              cases of tree mortality noted in large-
            range in southeastern Arizona.  Since 
            its introduction to California, GSOB 
            has expanded its range and has killed 
            red oaks (Quercus Section Lobatae) 
            nearly continuously across public and  
            private lands (Figure 2).
            Distribution and Hosts
            The native distribution of GSOB likely 
            coincides with that of Emory oak, Q. 
            emoryi Torrey, including the Coronado             Figure 1.  Adult goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus
