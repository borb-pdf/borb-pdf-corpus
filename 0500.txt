             If a different home currency is to be given, the second occurrence of C504 in the CUX segment is to be used as follows: 
             second 6347: '3' , second 6345 contains the currency, and second 6343: '3'. Data element 5402 contains the currency conversion rate.  
              
             Home currency: in some cases it is a requirement that, for invoicing in foreign currency, the invoice taxable and tax (e.g. VAT) amounts 
             must also be expressed in home currency. Relating this to the CUX segments, authorities would require the invoicing currency and the 
             home currency to be shown, together with the applied rate of exchange (element 5402)

                Amount being the balance of the amount to be adjusted and the adjusted amount - in invoice currency. 
                This amount is used for instance, if the invoice total amount - calculated by the computer - has fractions, but the invoice 
                shall always show only whole currency units (e.g. SEK) 
                In some countries the invoice amount is always rounded to full currency units (e.g. SEK in Sweden). The sum of all line item amounts +  
                charges, taxes does often not equal to this rounded invoice amount. In this case, an adjustment amount m ight be necessary to explain the 
                difference.
