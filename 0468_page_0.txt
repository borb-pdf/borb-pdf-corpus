                        Abstract. The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its
                        utility through a number of projects, not least Bitcoin. Each such project can be seen as a simple application on
                        a decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional singleton machine with
                        shared-state.
                           Ethereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources,
                        each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others.
                        Wediscuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage.
