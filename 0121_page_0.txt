                                                            Abstract
                                    The bitcoin protocol can encompass the global ﬁnancial transac-
                                 tion volume in all electronic payment systems today, without a single
                                 custodial third party holding funds or requiring participants to have
                                 anything more than a computer using a broadband connection. A
                                 decentralized system is proposed whereby transactions are sent over
                                 a network of micropayment channels (a.k.a.  payment channels or
                                 transaction channels) whose transfer of value occurs oﬀ-blockchain.
                                 If Bitcoin transactions can be signed with a new sighash type that
                                 addresses malleability, these transfers may occur between untrusted
                                 parties along the transfer route by contracts which, in the event of un-
                                 cooperative or hostile participants, are enforceable via broadcast over
                                 the bitcoin blockchain in the event of uncooperative or hostile partici-
                                 pants, through a series of decrementing timelocks.
                           1    The Bitcoin Blockchain Scalability Problem
                           The Bitcoin[1] blockchain holds great promise for distributed ledgers, but
                           the blockchain as a payment platform, by itself, cannot cover the world’s
                           commerce anytime in the near future. The blockchain is a gossip protocol
                           whereby all state modiﬁcations to the ledger are broadcast to all partic-
                           ipants.  It is through this “gossip protocol” that consensus of the state,
                           everyone’s balances, is agreed upon. If each node in the bitcoin network
                           must know about every single transaction that occurs globally, that may
                                                                1
