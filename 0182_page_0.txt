          NRG’s Suppliers are a critical link in our vision to build a more sustainable future. We are committed to 
          paying our Suppliers accurately and on time, so we use scanners and optical character recognition to read 
          invoices. Invoices from Suppliers that follow these instructions can be scanned, processed, and paid more 
          efficiently.
