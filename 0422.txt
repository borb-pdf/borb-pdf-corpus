     ● Switch off any portable heaters.
     ● Switch off and unplug all electrical appliances except those 
       that are meant to stay on, like a fridge.
     ● Stub out all cigarettes and always empty ashtrays having 
       ensured contents are completely extinguished.
     ● Close all doors – it can keep your escape route free from 
       smoke and may stop a fire spreading.
     ● If you use an electric blanket, turn it off when you get into bed 
       and never use an electric blanket and hot water bottle together.
     Never Smoke in Bed:
     Smoking is one of the main causes of house fires.

     ● At night, keep a torch handy in case of a power outage and

     Smoke/Heat Detectors:                                         please ask a member of staff.
     ● If you have chosen to install additional battery powered smoke 
       or heat detectors in your home, these should be checked
       regularly. Do not remove batteries unless you are replacing old
       for new. This is a highly dangerous practice and could cost lives.
