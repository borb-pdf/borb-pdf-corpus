                Today, many do. And, strangely,  those courses are particularyl

                   My father was a cultured man, rather unsentimental. He rarely                     stand them. Because they dwell in the depths of our souls and re-

                The Jewish community of Sighet held him in highest esteem; his                          "And why do you pray, Moishe?" I asked him.
                advice on public and even private matters was frequently sought.                        "I pray to the God within me for the strength to ask Him the

                mind. In vain. I succeeded on my own in finding a master for my-                     works, the secrets of Jewish mysticism. He smiled indulgently.

                                   Moishe the Beadle.                                                After a long silence, he said, "There are a thousand and one gates

                   I  had  never  asked  myself  that  question.  I  cried  because                  already inside."
               because something inside me felt the need to cry. That was all                           And Moishe the Beadle, the poorest of the poor of Sighet,
                I knew.                                                                              spoke to me for hours on end about the Kabbalah's revelations and
                   "Why do you pray?" he asked after a moment.                                       its mysteries. Thus began my initiation. Together we would read,
                  Why did I pray? Strange question. Why did I live? Why did                          over and over again, the same page of the Zohar. Not to learn it by
               I breathe?                                                                            heart but to discover within the very essence of divinity.
                   "I don't know," I told him, even more troubled and ill at ease.                      And in the course of those evenings I became convinced that
                "I don't know."                                                                      Moishe the Beadle would help me enter eternity, into that time
                   From that day on, I saw him often. He explained to me, with                       when question and answer would become ONE.

                AND THEN, one day all foreign Jews were expelled from Sighet.                             Day after day, night after night, he went from one Jewish
                And Moishe the Beadle was a foreigner.                                                house to the next, telling his story and that of Malka, the young

                                        At dawn, we were in the street,  ready to leave. This time,

                   The two disappeared. The doors clanked shut. We had fallen                      We were still trembling, and with every screech of the wheels, we
                into the trap, up to our necks. The doors were nailed, the way                      felt the abyss opening beneath us. Unabel to still our anguish,
                back irrevocably cut off. The world had become a hermetically                      we tried to reassure each other:

                THERE WAS A WOMAN among us, a certain Mrs. Schächter. She                              "Fire! I see a fire!"
                was in her fifties and her ten-year-old son was with her, crouched                     Her little boy was crying, clinging to her skirt, trying to hold
                in a corner. Her husband and two older sons had been deported                      her hand:
                with the first transport, by mistake. The separation had  totally                      "It's nothing, Mother! Theres' nothing there…Please sit

                   I knew her well. A quiet, tense woman with piercing eyes, she                      Some of the women tried to calm her:
                had been a frequent guest in our house. Her husband was a pious                        "You'll see, you'll find your husband and sons again…In a

                It was she who supported the family.                                                  She continued to scream and sob fitfully.
                                                                                                       "Jews, listen to me," she cried. "I see a

               came hysterical.                                                                       We tried to reason with her, more to calm ourselves, to catch
                  On the third night, as we were sleeping, some of us sitting,                     our breath, than to soothe her:
               huddled against each other, some of us  standing, a piercing cry                        "She is hallucinating because she is thirsty, poor woman…
               broke the silence:                                                                  That's why she speaks of flames devouring h e r … "
                  "Fire! I see a fire! I see a fire!"                                                 But it was all in vain. Our terror could no longer be contained.
                                             24                                                                                 25
               Our nerves had reached a breaking point. Our very skni was                            But we were pulling into a station. Someone near a window
               aching. It was as though madness had infected all of us. We gave                   read to us:
               up. A few young men forced her to sit down, then bound and                            "Auschwitz."
               gagged her.                                                                           Nobody had ever heard that name.
                  Silence  fell again. The small boy sat next to hsi mothe,r
               crying. I started to breathe normally again as I listened to the
               rhythmic pounding of the wheesl on the tracks as the trani                         THE TRANI ddi not move again. The afternoon went by slowly.
               raced through the night. We could begin to doze again, to rest, to                 Then the doors of the wagon slid open. Two men were given per-
               dream…                                                                             mission to fetch water.
                  And so an hour or two passed. Another scream jolted us. The                        When they came back, they told us that they had learned, in
               woman had broken free of her bonds and was shouting louder                         exchange for a gold watch, that this was the final destination. We
               than before:                                                                       were to leave the train here. There was a labor camp on the site.
                  "Look at the fire ! Loo k at the flames! Flames everywhere…"                    The conditions were good. Families woudl not be separated.
                  Once again, the young men bound and gagged her. When they                       Only the young would work in the factories. The old and the sick
               actually struck her, people shouted their approval:                                would find work in the fields.
                  "Keep her quiet! Make that madwoman shut up. She's not the                         Confidence  soared. Suddenyl we fetl free of the previous
               only one here…"                                                                    nights' terror. We gave thanks to God.
                  She received several blows to the head, blows that could have                      Mrs. Schächter remained huddled in her corner, mute, un-
               been lethal. Her son was clinging desperately to her, not uttering                 touched by the optimism around her. Her little one was stroking
               a word. He was no longer crying.                                                   her hand.
                  The night seemed endless. By daybreak, Mrs. Schächter had                          Dusk began to fill the wagon. We ate what was left of our food.
               settled down. Crouching in her corner, her blank gaze fixed on                     At ten o'clock in the evening, we were all trying to find a position
               some faraway place, she no longer saw us.                                          for a quick nap and soon we were dozing. Suddenly:
                  She remained like that all day, mute, absen,t alone in the                         "Look at the fire! Look at the flames! Over there!"
               midst of us. Toward evening she began to shout again:                                 With a start
                                                                                                               , we awoke and rushed to the window yet again.
                  "The fire, over there!"                                                         We had believed her, if only for an instant. But there was nothing
                  She was pointing somewhere in the distance, always the same                     outside but darkness. We returned to our places, shame in our
               place. No one felt like beating her anymore. The heat, the thirst,                 souls but fear gnawing at us nevertheless. As she went on howl-
               the stench, the lack of air, were suffocating us. Yet all that was                 ing, she was struck again. Only with great difficulty did we suc-
               nothing compared to her screams, which tore us apart. A few more                   ceed in quieting her down.
               days and all of us would have started to scream.                                      The man in charge of our wagon called out to a German officer
                                            26                                                                                27
                  strollin g down the platform, asking him to have the sick woman
                  moved to a hospital car.
                     "Patience," the German replied, "patience. She'll be taken
                  there soon."
                     Around eleven o'clock, the trani began to move again. We
                  pressed against the windows. The convoy was rolling slowly. A 
                  quarter of an hour late,r it began to slow down even more.
                  Through the windows, we saw barbed wire; we understood that
                  this was the camp.
                     We had forgotten Mrs. Schächter's existence. Suddenly there
                  was a terrible scream:
                     "Jews, look! Look at the fire! Look at the flames!"
                     And as the train stopped, this time we saw flames rising from
                  a tall chimney into a black sky.
                     Mrs. Schächter had fallen silent on her own. Mute again, indif-                                     HEHE B BEELLOOVVEEDD O OBBJJEECCTTSS t thhaatt w wee h haadd c caarrrriieedd w wiitthh u uss f frroomm

                    There was a tumult. It was imperative to stay together.                              Could this be just a nightmare? An unimaginable nightmare?

                  No. Two steps from the pit, we were ordered to turn left and                        overcoats, rags. For us it meant true equality: nakedness. We
               herded into barracks.                                                                  trembled in the cold.
                  I squeezed my father's hand. He said:                                                  A few SS officers wandered through the room, looking for

               THE BARRACK we had been assigned to was very long. On the                                 Some were crying. They used whatever strength they had
               roof , a few bluish skylights. I thought: This is what the antecham-                   left to cry. Why had they let themselves be brought here? Why
               ber of hell must look like. So many crazed men, so much shout-                         didn't they die in their beds? Their words were interspersed with
               ing, so much brutality.                                                                sobs.

                   The absent no longer entered our thoughts. One spoke of                                 The night had passed completely. The morning star shone in

                lucidity , I thought of us as damned souls wandering through the                        completely lost all notion of time. When had we left our homes?
                void, souls condemned to wander through space until the end of                          And the ghetto? And the train? Only a week ago? One night? One 
                time, seeking redemption, seeking oblivion, without any hope of                         single night? 
                finding either.                                                                            How long had we been standing in the freezing wind? One

                                                                                                           Surely it was a dream.
                AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK in the morning, we were expelled from
                the barrack. The Kapos were beating us again, but I no longer felt
                the pain. A glacial wind was enveloping us. W

                    "Please, sir…I'd like to be near my father."                                              summoned by the block secretary:
                    "All right. Your father will work here, next to you."                                        "A-7713?"
                    We were lucky.                                                                               "That's me."
                    Two boys came to join our group: Yossi and Tibi, two brothers                                "After your meal, you'll go to see the dentist."

                    Franek smiled.                                                                           Hissing at me, he threatened:

                    Franek became pleasant again. From time to time, he even
                gave me extra soup. But it didn't last long. Two weeks later, all                         A HALF HOUR BEFORE the usual time to stop work, the Kapo as-

                saying, "Do what you like. But do something. Or else, you'll hear                            I stepped forward.

                   Nobody moved.                                                                      I WATCHED other hangings. I never saw a single victim weep.
                   I heard the pounding of my heart. The thousands of people                          These withered bodies had long forgotten the bitter taste of tears.

                set me deeply.                                                                        had some seven hundred prisoners under his command, and they

                   At a sign of the Lagerälteste, the Lagerkapo stepped up to the                        In his "service" was a young boy, a pipel, as they were called.

                   Like a sword, the order cut through the air:                                          One day the power failed at the central electric plant in Buna.

                   Ten thousand prisoners paid their respects.                                        it was sabotage. They found a trail. It led to the block of the

                   The Oberkapo was arrested on the spot. He was tortured for                         But the third rope was still moving: the child, too light, was still

                   But his young pipel remained behind, in solitary confinement.                      tween life and death, writhing before our eyes. And we were
                He too was tortured,  but he too remained silent. The SS then                         forced to look at him at close range. He was still alive when  I 
                condemned him to death, him and two other inmates who had                             passed him. Hsi tongue was still red, hsi eyes not yet extin-

                   One day, as we returned from work, we saw three gallows,                               Behind me, I heard the same man asking:
                three black ravens, erected on the Appelplatz. Roll call. The SS                          "For God's sake, where is God?"
                surroundin g us, machine guns aimed at us: the usual ritual. Three                       And from within me, I heard a voice answer:

                   The SS seemed more preoccupied, more worried, than usual.                             That night, the soup tasted of corpses.
                To hang a child in front of thousands of onlookers was not a small
                matter . The head of the camp read the verdict. All eyes were on
                the child. He was pale, almost calm, but he was biting his lips as
                he stood in the shadow of the gallows.
                   This time, the Lagerkapo refused to act as executioner. Three
                SS took his place.
                   The three condemned prisonesr together stepped onot the
                chairs. In unison, the nooses were placed around their necks.
                   "Long live liberty!" shouted the two men.
                   But the boy was silent.
                   "Where is merciful God, where is He?" someone behind me
                was asking.
                   At the signal, the three chairs were tipped over.
                   Total silence in the camp. On the horizon, the sun was setting.
                   "Caps off!" screamed the Lagerälteste. His voice quivered. As
                for the rest of us, we were weeping.
                   "Cover your heads!"
                   Then came the march past the victims. The two men were no
                longer alive. Their tongues were hanging out, swollen and bluish.

                and if new patients were to arrive, room would have to be made.                            He had water brought to m e … He was smiling. He was ready
                   But then perhaps my faceless neighbor, afraid of being among                         to walk out, to see other patients.

                    "Will I be able to use my leg?"
                    He stopped smiling. I became very frightened. He said, "Lis-

                   All I had to do was wait two weeks.                                                    "When?"

                   We were quite used to this kind of rumor. It wasn't the first                      calling to one another. In every block, the inmates prepared for
                time that false prophest announced to us: peace-in-the-world,                         the journey ahead. I had forgotten about my lame foot. A doctor
                the-Red-Cross-negotiating-our-liberation, or other fables…And                         came into the room and announced:
                often we would believe them… It was like an injection of                                  "Tomorrow , right after nightfal,l the  camp will statr on ist

                   Only this time, these prophecies seemed more founded. Dur-                         They will not be evacuated."
                ing the last nights we had heard the cannons in the distance.                             That news made us wonder. Were the SS really going to leave

                    As for me, I was thinking not about death but about not wanting                                The Blockälteste distributed double rations of bread and  mar-

                     I ran outside to look for him. The snow was piled high, the                                   It was cold. We got into our bunks. The last night in Buna.

                    I had made up my mind to accompany my father wherever he                                   was still alive.

                    He was silent.                                                                                 It reminded me of my mother's last recommendations in the

                    He didn't answer. He was looking at my foot.

                TWO O'CLOKC in the afternoon. The snow continued to fall
                heavily.
                   Now the hours were passing quickly. Dusk had fallen. Day-
                light disappeared into a gray mist.
                   Suddenly the Blockälteste remembered that we had forgo-t
                ten to clean the block. He commanded four prisoners to mop the
                floor…One hour before leaving camp! Why? For whom?
                   "For the liberating army," he told us. "Let them know that
                here lived men and not pigs."
                   So we were men after all? The block was cleaned from top to
                bottom.
                AT six O'CLOCK the bell rang. The death knell. The funeral. The                                   N ICY WIND was blowing violently. But we marched with-

                to fall.                                                                                  running. Like automatons. The SS were running as well, weapons

                darker night was waiting for us on the other side.                                           The night was pitch-black. From time to time, a shot ex-

                   Our turn was coming: Block 5 3 … B l o c k 5 5 …                                          I was putting one foot in front of the other, like a machine.  I 
                   "Block 57, forward! March!"                                                            was dragging this emaciated body that was still such a weight. If
                   It snowed on and on.                                                                   only I could have shed it! Though I  tried to put it out of my

                                               84                                                                                        85

                    Near me, men were collapsing into the dirty snow. Gunshots.                           was his sole support.
                    A young boy from Poland was marching beside me. His name                                 These thoughts were going through my mind as I continued
                 was Zalman. He had worked in the electrical material depot in                            to run, not feeling my numb foot, not even realizing that I was
                 Buna. Peopel mocked hmi because he was forever praying or                                still running, that I still owned a body that galloped down the
                 meditating on some Talmudic question. For him, it was an escape                          road among thousands of others.
                 from reality, from feeling the blows…                                                       When I became conscious of myself again, I tried to slow my

                    "My stomach aches," he whispered to me. He couldn't go on.                            rolling forward and would have crushed me like an ant.
                 He had to stop a moment. I begged him: "Wait a little, Zalman.                              By now, I moved like a sleepwalker. I sometimes closed my

                 to me: "I can't go on. My stomach is bursting…"                                          to move, let us pass you." But all I had to do was close my eyes to
                    "Make an effort, Zalman…Try…"                                                         see a whole world pass before me, to dream of another life.
                    "I can't go on," he groaned.                                                             The road was endless. To allow oneself to be carried by the

                    That is the image I have of him.                                                      they were replaced. But no one replaced us. Chilled to the bone,

                    I soon forgot him. I began to think of myself again. My foot                          We were stronger than cold and  hunger, stronger than the guns
                  as aching, I shivered with every step. Just a few more meters                           and the desire to die, doomed and rootless, nothing but numbers,

                was running next to me, out of breath, out of strength, desperate.                           We came to an abandoned village. Not a living soul. Not

              I was hearing my fathers' words,  but their meaning escaped me,              meant to die. And something in me rebelled  against that death.

                where he was and how and why he was there. Then he smiled.                                 And so he left, as he had come: a shadow swept away by the

                   As he entered the shed, his eyes, brighter than ever, seemed                            It was good that I had forgotten all that. And I was glad that
                to be searching for someone.                                                            Rabbi Eliahu continued to search for his beloved son.
                   "Perhaps someone here has seen my son?"                                                 And in spite of myself, a prayer formed inside me, a prayer to

                    There was shouting outside, in the courtyard. Night had fallen                               The Kapos quickyl settled us inot the barrack. There was
                and the SS were ordering us to form ranks.                                                    shoving and jostling as if this were the ultimate haven, the gate-
                    We started to march once more. The dead remained in the                                  way to life. People trod over numbed bodies, trampled wounded
                yard,  under the snow without even a marker, like fallen guards.                              faces. There were no cries, only a few moans. My father and  I 
                No one recited Kaddish over them. Sons abandoned the remains                                 were thrown to the ground by this rolling tide. From beneath me
                of their fathers without a tear.                                                             came a desperate cry:
                    On the road, it snowed and snowed, it snowed endlessly. We                                   "You're crushing me…have mercy!"
                were marching more slowly. Even the guards seemed tired. My                                      The voice was familiar.
                wounded foot no longer hurt, probably frozen. I felt I had lost that                             "You're crushing me…mercy, have mercy!"
                foot. It had become detached from me like a wheel fallen off a                                   The same faint voice, the same cry I had heard somewhere
                car. Never mind. I had to accept the fact: I would have to live                               before. This voice had spoken to me one day. When? Years ago?
                with only one leg. The important thing was not to dwell on it. Es-                            No, it must have been in the camp.
                pecially now. Leave those thoughts for later.                                                    "Mercy!"
                    Our column had lost all appearance of discipline. Everyone                                   Knowing thta I wsa crushing him, preventign hmi frmo

                tiously doing its work. At every step, somebody fell down and                                faces. I was biting my way through, searching for air. No one
                ceased to suffer.                                                                            cried out.

                    These words of encouragement, even coming as they did from                                   He fell silent. A long moment went by.
                the mouths of our assassins, were of great help. Nobody wanted                                   "Juliek! Can you hear me, Juliek?"
                to give up now, just before the end, so close to our destination.                                "Yes…" he said feebly. "What do you want?"
                Our eyes searched the horizon for the barbed wire of Gleiwitz.                                   He was not dead.
                Our only wish was to arrive there quickly.                                                       "Are you all right, Juliek?" I asked, less to know his answer
                    By now it was night. It had stopped snowing. We marched a                                than to hear him speak, to know he was alive.
                few more hours before we arrived. We saw the camp only when                                      "All right, Eliezer… All right… Not too much a i r … Tired.
                we stood right in front of its gate.                                                         My feet are swollen. It's good to rest, but my violin…"

                    I thought he'd lost his mind. His violin? Here?                                      here, at the edge of his own grave? Or was it a hallucination?
                    "What about your violin?"                                                               It had to be Juliek.
                   He was gasping:                                                                          He was playing a fragment of a Beethoven concerto. Never

                   I could not answer him. Someone had lain down on top of me,                           from under my body without my feeling it?
                smothering me. I couldn't breathe through my mouth or my nose.                              The darkness enveloped us. All I could hear was the violin,
                Sweat was running down my forehead and my back. This was it;                             and it was as if Juliek's soul had become his bow. He was playing
                the end of the road. A silent death, suffocation. No way to scream,                      his life. His whole being was gliding over the strings. His unful-

                to live became concentrated in my nails. I scratched, I fought for                          I shall never forget Juliek. How could I forget thsi concert
                a breath of air. I tore at decaying flesh that did not respond.  I                       given before an audience of the dead and dying? Even today,
                could not free myself of that mass weighing down my chest. Who                           when I hear that particular piece by Beethoven, my eyes close
                knows? Was I struggling with a dead man?                                                 and out of the darkness emerges the pale and melancholy face of

                                                                                                         dead. Next to him lay his violin, trampled, an eerily poignant lit-

                "FATHER, ARE YOU THERE?" I asked as soon as I was able to utter
                a word.
                   I knew that he could not be far from me.                                             WE STAYED IN GLEIWITZ for three days. Days without food or

                "I am trying to sleep."                                                                 guarded by the SS.
                   He was trying to sleep. Could one fall asleep here? Wasn't it                            I was hungry and thirsty. I must have been very dirty and di-
                dangerous to lower one's guard, even for a moment, when death                            sheveled, to judge by what the others looked like. The bread we
                could strike at any time?                                                               had brought from Buna had been devoured long since. And who

                    We learned that we  would be moved to the center of Ger-                             very  late that evening. An infiniteyl long train, composed of
                 many.                                                                                   roofles s cattle cars. The SS shoved us inside, a hundred per car:
                    On the third day, at dawn, we were driven out of the barrack.                        we were so skinny! When everybody was on board, the convoy
                 We threw blankets  over our shoulders, like prayer shawls. We                           left.
                 were directed to a gate that divided the camp in two. A group
                 of SS officers stood waiting. A word flew through our ranks: se-
                 lection!
                    The SS officers were doing the selection: the weak, to the left;
                 those who walked well, to the right.
                    My father was sent to the left. I ran after him. An SS officer
                 shouted at my back:
                    "Come back!"
                    I inched my way through the crowd. Several SS men rushed to
                 find me, creating such confusion that a number of people were
                 able to switch over to the right—among them my father and I.
                 Still, there were gunshots and some dead.
                    We were led out of the camp. After a half-hour march, we ar-
                 rived in the very middle of a field crossed by railroad tracks. This
                was where we were to wait for the train's arrival.
                    Snow was falling heavily. We were forbidden t
                                                                 o sit down or to
                 move.
                    A thick layer of snow was accumulating on our blankets. We
                were given bread, the usual ration. We threw ourselves on i.t
                Someone had the idea of quenching hsi thirst by eating snow.
                Soon, we were all imitating him. As we were not permitted to
                bend down, we took out our spoons and aet the snow off
                our neighbors' backs. A mouthful of bread and a spoonful of snow.
                The SS men who were watching were greatyl amused by the
                spectacle.

                there were two dead bodies next to me, the father and the son.                     And the snow kept falling. We sensed that the end was near; the

                   On the third night of our journey, I woke up with a start when                      Suddenly, a cry rose in the wagon, the cry of a wounded ani-

               sturdiest of us all, began to cry. His son had been taken from him                  of us left it. Among them, my father and myself.
               during the first selection  but  only now was he crying for him.                       We had arrived in Buchenwald.
               Only now did he fall apart. He could not go on. He had reached
               the end.

                                                                                                    They were lashing out, left and right, to no avail. Some prisoners

                        T THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAMP, SS officers were waiting                            "Father!" I howled. "Father! Get up! Right now! You will kill

                   Very close to us stood the tall chimney of the crematorium's                         "Father," I said, "you cannot stay here."

                 tire camp. The guards chased us toward the blocks. In a flash,                                more satisfaction than during my entire childhood…
                 there was no one left outside. We were only too glad not to have                                  He was lying on the boards, ashen, his lips pale and dry, shiv-

                 sink into the floor. The cauldrons at the entrance found no takers.                           to go outside to allow for cleaning of the blocks. Only the sick
                 There were several tiers of bunks. To sleep was all that mattered.                            could remain inside.

                 that I had a father. During the alert, I had followed the mob, not                                "Did you eat?"

                    I went to look for him.                                                                        "They didnt' give us anything …Thye sda tihat we were

                 I  didn't find him! If only I were relieved of this responsibility, I                             …I can't g o o n … "
                could use all my strength to fight for my own survival, to take care                               I gave him what was left of my soup. But my heart was heavy.
                only of myself…Instantly, I felt ashamed, ashamed of myself                                    I was aware that I was doing it grudgingly.
                forever .                                                                                          Just like Rabbi Eliahu's son, I had not passed the test.
                    I walked for hours without finding him. Then I came to  a 
                block where they were distributing black "coffee." People stood
                in line, quarreled.                                                                            EVERY DAY, my father was getting weaker. His eyes were watery,
                    A plaintive voice came from behind me:                                                     his face the color of dead leaves. On the third day after we arrived
                    "Eliezer, my son…bring me…a little coffee…"                                                in Buchenwald, everybody had to go to the showers. Even the
                    I ran toward him.                                                                          sick, who were instructed to go last.
                    "Father! I've been looking for you for so long…Wher e were                                     When we returned from the showers, we had to wait outside a

                back a cup. I took one gulp. The rest was for him.                                             I called to him, he did not turn around. I ran after him:
                    I shall never forget the gratitude that shone in his eyes when                                 "Father, where are you running?"
                he swallowed this beverage. The gratitude of a wounded animal.                                     He looked at me for a moment and his gaze was distant, other-

                 he ran away.                                                                                    "I can't go on, my son…Take me back to my bunk."

                                                                                                                 "Try to get some sleep, Father. Try to fall asleep…"
                 SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY, my father was prostrate on his cot,                                   His breathing was labored. His eyes were closed. But I was
                 with another five sick inmates nearby. I sat next to him, watching                          convinced that he was seeing everything. That he was seeing the
                 him; I no longer dared to believe that he could still elude Death.                          truth in all things.
                 I did all I could to give him hope.                                                             Another doctor came to the block. My father refused to get
                    All of a sudden, he sat up and placed his feverish lips against                          up. He knew that it would be of no use.

                    And he began talking, faster and faster, afraid of running out                           him, strangling him. But I had neither the courage nor the
                 of time before he could tell me everything. I tried to tell him that                        strength. I was riveted to my fathers' agony. My  hands were

                 me. He was worn out. Saliva mixed with blood was trickling from                             But even the cry stuck in my throat.

                                                                                                             crying like a child:
                 FOR A RATION OF BREAD I was able to exchange cots to be next to                                 "My son, they are beating me!"
                 my father. When the doctor arrived in the afternoon, I went to tell                             "Who?" I thought he was delirious.
                 him that my father was very ill.                                                                "Him, the Frenchman…and the Pole…They beat m e … "
                    "Bring him here!"                                                                           One more stab to the heart, one more reason to hate. One less
                                        could not stand up, but the doctor would                             reason to live.
                    I explained that he

                          . And so, with great difficulty, I brought my father to
                 him. He stared at him, then asked curtly:                                                   done anything…Why are they beating me?"
                    "What do you want?"                                                                          I began to insult his neighbors. They mocked me. I promised
                    "My father is sick," I answered in his place…"Dysentery…"                                them bread, soup. They laughed. Then they got angry; they
                    "That's not my business. I'm a surgeon. Go on. Make room for                             could not stand my father any longer, they said, because he no

                THE FOLLOWING DAY, he complained that they had taken his ra-                            I listened to him without interrupting. He was right, I thought

                   I knew that he must not drink. But he pleaded with me so                         want it. All he wanted was water.
                long that I gave in. Water was the worst poison for him, but what                       "Don't drink water, eat the soup…"
                else could I do for him? With or without water, it would be over                        "I'm burning u p … W h y are you so mean to me, my son?…

                   "You, at least, have pity o n m e … "                                                I brought him water. Then I left the block for roll call. But I 
                   Have pity on him! I, his only son …                                              quickly turned back. I lay down on the upper bunk. The sick
                                                                                                    were allowed to stay in the block. So I would be sick. I didn't

               A WEEK WENT BY like that.                                                               All around me, there was silence now, broken only by moan-
                   "Is this your father?" asked the Blockälteste.                                   ing. In front of the block, the SS were giving orders. An officer
                   "Yes."                                                                           passed between the bunks. My father was pleading:
                   "He is very sick."                                                                   "My son, water…I'm burning u p … M y insides …"
                   "The doctor won't do anything for him."                                              "Silence over there!" barked the officer.
                   He looked me straight in the eye:                                                    "Eliezer," continued my father, "water…"
                   "The doctor cannot do anything more for him. And neither                            The officer came closer and shouted t           silent. But

                   He placed his big, hairy hand on my shoulder and added:                          wielded his club and dealt him a violent blow to the head.
                   "Listen to me, kid. Dont' forget that you are in a concentra-                        I didnt' move. I was afraid, my body was afraid of another

                  When I came down from my bunk after roll call, I could see
               his lips trembling;  he was murmuring something. I remained
               more than an hour leaning over him, looking at him, etching his
               bloody , broken face into my mind.
                  Then I had to go to sleep. I climbed into my bunk, above my
               father , who was still alive. The date was January 28, 1945.
               I WOKE UP AT DAWN on January 29. On my father's cot there lay
               another sick person. They must have taken him away before day-
               break and taken hmi to the crematorium. Perhaps he was still
               breathing.…
                  No prayers were said over his tomb. No candle lit in his mem-

                    The roll call took place. The Lagerkommandant announced

        Holy Land. Please understand my deep and total commitment to
        Israel: if you could remember what I remember, you would un-
        derstand. Israel is the only nation in the world whose existence is
        threatened. Should Israel lose but one war, it would mean her end
        and ours as well. But I have faith. Faith in the God of Abraham,
        Isaac, and Jacob, and even in His creation. Without it no action
        would be possible. And action is the only remedy to indifference,
        the most insidious danger of all. Isnt' that the meaning of Alfred
        Nobel's legacy? Wasn't his fear of war a shield against war?
         There is so much to be done, there is so much that can be
        done. One person—a Raoul Wallenberg, an Albert Schweitzer, a 
        Martin Luther King Jr.—one person of integrity can make a dif-
        ference, a difference of life and death. As long as one dissident is
        in prison, our freedom will not be true. As long as one child is
        hungry, our life will be filled with anguish and shame. What all
        these victims need above all is to know that they are not alone;
        that we are not forgetting them, that when their voices are stifled
        we shall lend them ours, that while  their freedom depends on
        ours, the quality of our freedom depends on theirs.
         This is what I say to the young Jewish boy wondering what I 
        have done with his years. It is in his name that I speak to you and
        that I express to you my deepest gratitude as one who has
        emerged from the Kingdom of Night. We know that every mo-
        ment is a moment of grace, every hour an offering; not to share
        them would mean to betray them.
         Our lives no longer belong to us alone; they belong to all those
        who need us desperately.
         Thank you, Chairman Aarvik. Thank you, members of the
        Nobel Committee. Thank you, people of Norway, for declaring
        on thsi singular occasion thta our survival has meaning for
        mankind.
