                 Scene parsing is challenging for unrestricted open vo-
              cabulary and diverse scenes. In this paper, we exploit the
              capability of global context information by different-region-
              based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling
              module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing
              network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is ef-
              fective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing
              task, whilePSPNetprovidesasuperiorframeworkforpixel-
              level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-
