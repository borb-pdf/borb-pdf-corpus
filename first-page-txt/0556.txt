          What is a plasma exchange?                              Plasma exchange is performed using a machine 
          Blood is made up of red cells, white cells and          called a Blood Cell Separator which can separate 
          platelets which are carried around in fluid called      blood into its various parts. The machine separates 
          plasma. The plasma can be separated from the rest  and removes the plasma portion of your blood and 
          of your blood, removed and replaced, and this 
          process is called plasma exchange. We can replace 
          your plasma with either fresh donor plasma or 
          human albumin solution which is the liquid part of 
          the plasma obtained by processing the fresh 
          plasma.
          The function of plasma is to carry blood cells (red 
          cells, white blood cells and platelets) and various 
          antibodies, hormones, and proteins around your 
          body. Plasma exchange is normally carried out when 
          there is a problem caused by abnormal antibodies 
          or proteins circulating in your plasma.
