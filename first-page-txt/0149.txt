        Public Consultation Paper 
     The Federal Reserve Banks      September 10, 2013 
          The U.S. payment system is undergoing a remarkable period of change, driven by 
          rapid adoption of technology and evolving end-user expectations. Going forward, 
          opportunity exists to improve speed and efficiency of payments and to maintain 
          payment system safety in the face of escalating threats. The Federal Reserve 
          Banks believe that collaboration and engagement with the industry is the 
          foundation of any enduring strategic improvements to the U.S. payment system 
          and look forward to public input to this consultative paper.
