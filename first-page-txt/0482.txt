                      Abstract: The economics profession appears to have been unaware of the long build-up to the 
                        current worldwide financial crisis and to have significantly underestimated its dimensions once 
                        it started to unfold. In our view, this lacunderstanding is due to a mk of   isallocation of research 
                        efforts in economics. We trace the deeper roots of this failure to the profession’s insistence on 
                        constructing models that, by design, disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world 
                        markets. The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses, 
                        and even dangers of its preferred models to the public. This state of affairs makes clear the need 
                        for a major reorientation of focus in the research economists undertake, as well as for the 
                        establishment of an ethical code that would ask economists to understand and communicate the 
                        limitations and potential misuses of their models.
