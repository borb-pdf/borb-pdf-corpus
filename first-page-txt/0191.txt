                      Prize money procedure  
                      All prize money will be paid in the Swedish currency SEK, EUR or in USD, depending on the 
                      tournament and/or competition that you have competed in.  
                      The prize money is only exempted from tax and social fees if your winning team is 
                      organized as a company/association or a non-profit organization.  
                      If you are claiming your prize money as a private individual, per Swedish law, you have to 
                      pay social fees and taxes since you will be receiving your prize money as a form of salary. 
                      For team based games one person is responsible for claiming the money if claimed as a 
                      private person.
