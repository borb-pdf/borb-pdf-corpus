                    Discussion Questions for The Italian Party 
                      
                    About the novel: 
                         •    This book has been called “sneaky” for how it seems to be a comedy, yet explores more 
                              serious issues as well. Did it live up to your expectations, surprise you, or something 
                              else? 
                         •    What effect does it have on you as a reader when you experience the story from more 
                              than one point of view, as in this book where you get both Scottie and Michael’s 
                              thoughts? 
                         •    People like to put books into “genres,” but some books resist categories. In your view, is 
                              this a spy story, a love story, a missing person story, a coming of age story, or something 
                              else? 
                         •    This novel could be considered part of a genre called “comedies of remarriage,” which 
                              includes films like “The Awful Truth” and “The Philadelphia Story.” How is the end of 
                              the novel both a happy ending and not a happy ending? 
                    About the characters: 
                         •    How did your view of Michael change as the story progressed? Scottie? 
                         •    Scottie and Michael were too young to participate in World War II, yet it had an effect on 
                              them to grow up during those years. How are they children of both the ‘40s and ‘50s? 
                         •    Who is Sebastian loyal to? Which side is he on? Why? 
                         •    What role do animals play in the novel? 
                    About the time period: 
                         •    Did it surprise you to learn that it was against the law to be gay if you were a government 
                              employee in the 1950s? 
                         •    The 1950s can seen as a cultural response to World War II. What events in this novel link 
                              those two eras? How was the mood of the ‘50s a reaction to the war years? 
                         •    What was appealing to post-war Italians about American products and the American way 
                              of life?
