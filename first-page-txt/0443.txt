                This leaflet contains evidence-based information about your proposed 
                urological procedure.  We have consulted specialist surgeons during its 
                preparation, so that it represents best practice in UK urology.  You should 
                use it in addition to any advice already given to you.

                                                        Key Points 
                   •  This involves having a catheter (plastic tube) passed into your 
                       bladder to instil an anti-cancer drug called BCG 
                   •  BCG is a vaccine that is used against tuberculosis; it contains live 
                       bacteria which have been attenuated (altered) to reduce the risk of 
                       infection.  It stimulates immune cells in the bladder to kill cancer 
                       cells 
                   •  It is used for non-muscle invasive cancers, which grow in the thin 
                       layer of cells lining the bladder but do not extend into the muscle of 
                       the bladder wall 
                   •  Treatment involves weekly instillations for 6 weeks (induction 
                       treatment), followed by maintenance treatments for up to three 
                       years 
                   •  Treatment reduces the chance of your bladder cancer returning 
                   •  Bladder tumours can recur during or after treatment, so follow-up 
                       bladder examinations (cystoscopies) are needed 
                   •  Like all powerful treatments, it comes with some significant side-
                       effects which you should balance against the risks of the bladder 
                       cancer itself 
                What does this procedure involve? 
                Instillation of an immunotherapy drug (BCG) into the bladder for aggressive 
                or frequently recurring non-muscle invasive cancer of the bladder.
