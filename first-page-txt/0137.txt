                    Checking the payment status of an invoice 
        
       For anyone with the SAP Approver role, you will have access to SAP transaction code /fbl1n.  We have 
       created a variant of this code that is designed to let you know the date that a future payment will be 
       generated, in the event that the transaction has already been processed by Accounts Payable (AP) but 
       the vendor payment terms have not yet triggered.   
       Once AP has processed an invoice, a 10-digit FI doc # will be generated, and you can find this through 
       various BUWorks reports.  Once you have the FI number for the invoice payment you are investigating, 
       you can then use the WebGUI tab in BUWorks, selecting the ECC System link (you may need to enable 
       popups in your browser). 
        
                                                   
        
       On the next screen, enter the transaction code FBL1N into the search bar and hit Enter. (This can also be 
       found in your User Menu, in the Department Approver â€“ Decentralized folder). 
        
                                  
        
       On the next screen, click Get Variant. 
        
                                                   
        
       This will create a pop-up window labeled Find Variant.  You need to erase your name from the Created 
       By field, and then click the Execute button (circled in the image below).
