                      Writing an Academic Paper 
        Listed below are the steps required to write an academic paper. These steps do not have to be done in 
        the order listed; in fact, they may be repeated many times during the process. Repeating steps most often 
        happens during the research, reading, and first draft stage of writing. Writing and learning is a fluid 
        process, so a thesis statement or viewpoints in the paper might change as you do your research. Or, an 
        outline might be more easily written after completing the first draft rather than before. In addition, it is 
        not unusual to go back to do further research or to revise a thesis statement when editing the rough 
        draft. 
            
        Select a Topic 
              choose, if possible, a topic that interests you  
              follow directions given by your professor  
              consult with the TA or professor if you are uncertain about the assignment 
            
        Create a time schedule with deadlines for each step 
                   research  
                   read & take notes  
                   outline/organize information  
                   write the first draft  
                   revise for completeness, conciseness & clarity  
                   edit & proofread 
            
        Find sources 
              remember that one source can lead to other useful information  
              gather several different viewpoints to appreciate the topic’s complexity  
              search the BISON catalogue for books, journals and other material in the UM Libraries’ 
            collections and search NETDOC databases for journal citations, full-text resources, abstracts  
              make a complete reference notecard for each source 
            
                       
                     You have the tools. We’ll help you use them.
