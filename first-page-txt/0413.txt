               1Always put your contact info on the front page so that people can ﬁnd your paper and send
            you comments! It’s the 21st century — get a web page. If your paper is ready for a faculty member
            to read it, it should be on your webpage. Put the date on the paper so people know if they are
            reading a new version.
               2I thank Toby Moskowitz for helpful comments.
