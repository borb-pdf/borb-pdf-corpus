                                           By A. M. TURING.
                              [Received 28 May, 1936.—Read 12 November, 1936.]
                  The "computable" numbers may be described briefly as the real
              numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means.
              Although the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable numbers.
              it is almost equally easy to define and investigate computable functions
              of an integral variable or a real or computable variable, computable
              predicates, and so forth. The fundamental problems involved are,
              however, the same in each case, and I have chosen the computable numbers
              for explicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. I hope
              shortly to give an account of the relations of the computable numbers,
              functions, and so forth to one another. This will include a development
              of the theory of functions of a real variable expressed in terms of com-
              putable numbers. According to my definition, a number is computable
              if its decimal can be written down by a machine.
                  In §§ 9, 10 I give some arguments with the intention of showing that the
              computable numbers include all numbers which could naturally be
              regarded as computable. In particular, I show that certain large classes
              of numbers are computable. They include, for instance, the real parts of
              all algebraic numbers, the real parts of the zeros of the Bessel functions,
              the number IT,s  e, etc. The computable numbers do not, however, include
              all definable numbers, and an example is given of a definable number
              which is not computable.
                  Although the class of computable numbers is so great, and in many
              Avays similar to the class of real numbers, it is nevertheless enumerable.
              In § 81 examine certain arguments which would seem to prove the contrary.
              By the correct application of one of these arguments, conclusions are
              reached which are superficially similar to thos Gbdelfe o Thesf.              e results
