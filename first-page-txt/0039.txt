    at       n       The medical name for golfer’s elbow is medial epicondylitis. The medial epicondyle 
    n ke             is the bony bit you can feel on the inside of your elbow (your funny bone). 
    aert     tie     The tendons of the muscles that run down the front of your arm and into your hand 
    nde u            (flexor muscles) start from the medial epicondyle.

    s thi            What causes Golfer’s Elbow? 
    n n o    or P    It is usually caused by overuse of the flexor muscles with repetitive movements and 
    eiv
     gice     f      movements against resistance. 
    vad                                          Overuse of the flexor muscles can cause 
    d an                                         micro-trauma to the tendon. This results in 
    s ise                                        inflammation of the tendon. Although this 
    cxer     tion                                is painful it does not cause long-lasting 
     el                                          damage.

    noes 
    ot d             This is difficult to say and will largely depend on how long you have had it for and 
    uo               whether you are able to avoid doing the things that are making it worse (see 
    ndha             overleaf for treatments).  It is likely to take some week, possibley months to fully
