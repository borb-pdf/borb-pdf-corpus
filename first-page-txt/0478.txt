                        Signed invoice packets should be sent (via mail, Fax, or email) to the IDEM Project Manager (PM).  
                        He or she will review the invoice and accompanying documentation to be sure the information is 
                        complete and accurate; including whether expenditures are appropriate for the project and work was 
                        completed within the grant agreement (or contract) term.  If there are problems or questions about 
                        the invoice or documentation, the PM will contact the Grantee.  Once the PM signs off on the 
                        invoice, payment will be direct deposited into the Granteeâ€™s bank account in 4 - 6 weeks.
