                           Induction Programme 
                                        
      Once the employee starts working for you, you have a duty of care towards 
      them. This includes making sure they can do the job both safely and 
      competently. The best way to ensure this is through a structured induction 
      programme. 
      Induction will help new staff to: 
          establish themselves quickly in their job and therefore maximise their 
           productivity  
          become motivated to do well and fit into the business early on 
          understand any health and safety issues relating to their job - this will 
           not only help to reduce accidents at work but also help you ensure that 
           you are meeting your duty of care obligations under the health and safety 
           legislation  
          understand your business' culture  
      Investing time in this process will give new workers a good grounding and help 
      them make fewer mistakes in the long run. The highest level of staff turnover is 
      among newer workers so it is important that the early period spent with your 
      business leaves a good impression on them.
