              WATER 
              Diseases can be caught from drinking contaminated water, or swimming in it.   
              Unless you know the water supply is safe where you are staying,  
              ONLY USE (in order of preference)         
                      1. Boiled water  
                      2. Bottled water or canned drinks  
                      3. Water treated by a sterilising agent.                                     
              This includes water used to make ice cubes in drinks and water for cleaning your teeth                                                                                                 
                       
              SWIMMING                                                                                               
              It is safer to swim in water that is well chlorinated.  If you are travelling to Africa, South America or some 
              parts of the Caribbean, avoid swimming in fresh water lakes and streams.  You can catch a parasitic 
              disease called schistosomiasis from such places.  This disease is also known as Bilharzia.  It is also wise 
              never to go barefoot, but to wear protective footwear when out, even on the beach.  Other diseases can 
              be caught from sand and soil, particularly wet soil.                                            
                                                    
              FOOD                                                                                                       
              Contaminated food is the commonest source of many diseases abroad.  You can help prevent it by 
              following these guidelines :       
           
                ONLY  EAT  WELL  COOKED  FRESH  FOOD 
                AVOID  LEFTOVERS  and  REHEATED  FOODS 
                ENSURE  MEAT  IS  THOROUGHLY  COOKED                              Two phrases to help you remember 
                EAT  COOKED VEGETABLES, AVOID SALADS                                                  
                ONLY  EAT  FRUIT  YOU  CAN  PEEL                                     COOK IT, PEEL IT, OR LEAVE IT! 
                NEVER  DRINK  UNPASTEURISED  MILK                                   WHEN IN DOUBT, LEAVE IT OUT! 
                AVOID  ICE-CREAM                                                                    
                SHELLFISH IS A HIGH RISK FOOD                                                        
                AVOID  BUYING  FOOD  FROM  STREET  VENDORS’ STALLS AS A GENERAL RULE 
               
              Another source of calories is alcohol!  If you drink to excess, alcohol could lead you to become carefree 
              and ignore these precautions. 
               
              PERSONAL  HYGIENE 
              Many diseases are transmitted by what is known as the ‘faecal-oral’ route.  To help prevent this, always 
              wash your hands with soap and clean water after going to the toilet, before eating and before handling 
              food.  Using hand gel is another sensible option. 
                
              TRAVELLERS’  DIARRHOEA 
               
              This the most common illness that you will be exposed to abroad and there is NO vaccine against it.   
              Diarrhoea is caused by eating and/or drinking food and water contaminated by bacteria, viruses or 
              parasites.  Risk of illness is higher in some countries than others. 
               
              High risk areas include North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, S.E. Asia, South 
                                                                                                                       1
