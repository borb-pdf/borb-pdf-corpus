          This leaflet, the pesticide label, and your training, tell you about pesticide
          dangers at work.         Your supervisor must know and help you learn about the
          pesticides you will use, how to safely use them, and how to protect
          yourself. Pesticides are chemicals that are used to kill insects,
          weeds, germs and plant diseases.             Fertilizers are not pesticides.
