                 popular. These systems enable users to add keywords (i.e., “tags”)            One approach to tagging has emerged in “social bookmarking” 
                 to  Internet  resources  (e.g.,  web  pages,  images,  videos)  without       tools where the act of tagging a resource is similar to categorizing 
                 relying  on  a  controlled  vocabulary.    Tagging  systems  have  the        personal bookmarks. In this model, tags allow users to store and

                 potential is largely due to the social structure that underlies many          for many years; however, these tools have recently increased in 
                 of the current systems.                                                       popularity as elements of social interaction have been introduced, 
                 Despite the rapid expansion of applications that support tagging of           connecting individual bookmarking activities to a rich network of 
                 resources, tagging systems are still not well studied or understood.          shared tags, resources, and users.

                 related  work  to  date.  We  offer  a  model  of  tagging  systems,          their tags for particular resources. In addition, each tag serves as a 
                 specifically  in  the  context  of  web-based  systems,  to  help  us         link  to  additional  resources  tagged  the  same  way  by  others.
