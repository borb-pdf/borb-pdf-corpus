                       General Principles 
                        of Conduct ;and Action
                        The  Saint-Gobain Group                                                                          has developed a number
                        of shared principles applied by both management
                        and employees that have guided the Group's
                        activities over the years.
                        Today the Group wishes to give written expression
                        to these principles, to help us communicate them
                        and reinforce their implementation throughout the
                        Group worldwide.
                        The purpose of  this documen t is also to make a
                        public sta temen t of Saint-Gobain â€™s adherence  to
                        these basic                                 principles                            of conduc t and  action,which
                        apply  to all companies within the Group regardless
                        of where they carry on business.
                        These principles ar                                                  e not intended to be exhaustive,
                        but to address the essential areas.
                        They are complemented, and may in the future be
                        further complemented by sometimes more specific
                        rules having regard to local conditions or particular
                        positions of responsibility, but in any case without
                        detracting from the basic principles.
                        Adherence to these principles is a requirement for
                        belonging to the Saint-Gobain Group.
                                                                                                                                                             General Principles o  f Conduct and Action of the Saint-Gobain Group <          1
