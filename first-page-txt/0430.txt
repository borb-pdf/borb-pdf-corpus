          The Request for Invoice/CPO Form is used by CSUDH departments to request Accounting Services to invoice Auxiliary Organizations, other CSU campuses, or other third party organizations: (1) for reimbursement of 
          an expense that's already been made (abatement) or (2) to record accounts receivable/revenue. To bill another CSU campus or the Chancellor's Office, a Cash Posting Order (CPO) will be prepared, instead of an 
          invoice.  Upon receipt of this completed form, Accounting Services will invoice Auxiliary Organizations, other CSU campuses,  and other 3rd party organizations on your behalf.  Please send the original form to 
          Accounting Services with supporting documentation.  Invoice will be mailed by Accounting Services to the customer and an electronic copy will be sent to the requesting department.  If you have questions, please 
          contact Accounting Services. 
          Please note that only Accounting Services may invoice or bill on behalf of the University.
