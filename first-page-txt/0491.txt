                  Talking Points -- Graphic Novels and Comic Books 
                   
                          Comic Book:  A serialized comic appearing in a magazine- sized booklet; it tells just one short 
                           story or part of a longer story in each “issue” 
                          Graphic Novel:  A novel-length self contained comic or a collection of comic books bound into a 
                           volume 
                          Manga:  Stylized Japanese graphic novel, reads right to left, both page and panel-wise. “Manga” 
                           is a genre of graphic novels (like mystery is a genre of fiction) that come from Japan, featuring a 
                           unique ascetic both in story and illustrations. The manga aesthetic has also carried over into 
                           anime, - a genre of cartoons also from Japan.  There are manga titles in each of our collections 
                           as well. 
                          “Graphic novel” and “comic book” are formats like large type or paperback, NOT genres. In fact 
                           most genres such as nonfiction, mystery, sci-fi, etc… are available in a graphic novel. 
                          The “Graphic” in graphic novel refers to the use of both pictures and words equally to tell the 
                           story, not to the content of the story itself.   
                          Just like regular books, graphic novels and comic books are written with a certain audience in 
                           mind.  This is why we have them divided into the children’s, YA and adult collections according 
                           to their content. 
                   
                  Education benefits of graphic novels and comic books: 
                          The average comic book introduces children to nearly twice as many new words as the average 
                           children’s book and more than five times as many as the average child-adult conversation.  
                          Many schools are using comic books as a way to encourage reluctant readers.  
                          Comic books contribute to the development of visual literacy, or the ability to understand and 
                           respond to a visual image.  
                           Even before children are ready to read text, comic books can give them practice in 
                           understanding material printed on a page, tracking left to right and top to bottom, and inferring 
                           what happens between individual panels in a story.  
                          Comic Books often contain more advanced vocabulary than traditional books at the same 
                           age/grade level.
