                          Aegean Sea: 
                          Greece/Turkey
      This information lealfet is for people who are considering to cross the Aegean 
      Sea between Greece and Turkey. The undocumented crossing constitutes an 
      offence both in Greece and Turkey and is above all very dangerous. This docu-
      ment aims neither to deter nor to encourage people to attempt the crossing but 
      seeks to provide objective information about risks, rights and vital safety mea-
      sures to take at sea. We wish that the information contained in this docu ment  
      can save your life but you should know it will not make the crossing safer.
      For twenty years, the EU has been denying visas for most applicants. At the 
      same time wars, conlficts and poverty are forcing out of their countries many 
      people who wish to seek protection in Europe. Despite the lack of legal ways 
      to reach European territory and despite life-threatening dangers, many of 
      you decide to emigrate anyway and cross the sea-border.* 
      *  Although this lealfet focuses speciifcally on the situation at the sea-border, some information 
       can still be useful also for those who might decide to cross the land-border in the Evros region.
