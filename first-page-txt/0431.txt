                 A Tax invoice is required to enable the ANU to claim back the GST on purchases from the 
                 Australian Taxation Office.  Tax Invoice requirements are based around the value of the 
                 invoice: 
                 Under $75 (excld GST)           Over $75 to $1000 (incl GST)            Over $1000 (incl GST)
