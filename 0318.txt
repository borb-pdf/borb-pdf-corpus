                A.  SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF ARTICLE XXI 
                 
                1.    Paragraphs (a) and (b): “it considers … essential security interests” 
                 
                      During discussions in the Geneva session of the Preparatory Committee, in response to an inquiry as to the 
                meaning of “essential security interests”, it was stated by one of the drafters of the original Draft Charter that 
                “We gave a good deal of thought to the question of the security exception which we thought should be included 
                in the Charter. We recognized that there was a great danger of having too wide an exception and we could not put 
                it into the Charter, simply by saying: ‘by any Member of measures relating to a Member's security interests,’ 
                because that would permit anything under the sun. Therefore we thought it well to draft provisions which would 
                take care of real security interests and, at the same time, so far as we could, to limit the exception so as to 
                prevent the adoption of protection for maintaining industries under every conceivable circumstance. … there must 
                be some latitude here for security measures. It is really a question of balance. We have got to have some 
                exceptions. We cannot make it too tight, because we cannot prohibit measures which are needed purely for 
                security reasons. On the other hand, we cannot make it so broad that, under the guise of security, countries will 
                put  on  measures  which  really  have  a  commercial  purpose”.  The  Chairman  of  Commission  A  suggested  in 
                response that the spirit in which Members of the Organization would interpret these provisions was the only 
                                                          1
                guarantee against abuses of this kind.  
                 
                      During the discussion of the complaint of Czechoslovakia at the Third Session in 1949 (see page 602) it was 
                stated, inter alia, that “every country must be the judge in the last resort on questions relating to its own security. 
                On the other hand, every contracting party should be cautious not to take any step which might have the effect of 
                                                           2
                undermining the General Agreement”.   
                 
                      In 1961, on the occasion of the accession of Portugal, Ghana stated that its boycott of Portuguese goods was 
                justified under the provisions of Article XXI:(b)(iii), noting that  
                 
                      “… under this Article each contracting party was the sole judge of what was necessary in its essential 
                      security interest. There could therefore be no objection to Ghana regarding the boycott of goods as justified 
                      by security interests. It might be observed that a country’s security interests might be threatened by a 
                      potential as well as an actual danger. The Ghanaian Government’s view was that the situation in Angola was 
                      a constant threat to the peace of the African continent and that any action which, by bringing pressure to 
                      bear on the Portuguese Government, might lead to a lessening of this danger, was therefore justified in the 
                                                                 3
                      essential security interests of Ghana”.  
                 
                      During the Council discussion in 1982 of trade restrictions applied for non-economic reasons by the EEC, 
                its member States, Canada and Australia against imports from Argentina (see page 603), the representative of the 
                EEC stated that “the EEC and its member States had taken certain measures on the basis of their inherent rights, 
                of which Article XXI of the General Agreement was a reflection. The exercise of these rights constituted a 
                general exception, and required neither notification, justification nor approval, a procedure confirmed by thirty-
                five years of implementation of the General Agreement. He said that in effect, this procedure showed that every 
                contracting party was - in the last resort - the judge of its exercise of these rights”. The representative of Canada 
                stated that “Canada’s sovereign action was to be seen as a political response to a political issue … Canada was 
                convinced that the situation which had necessitated the measures had to be satisfactorily resolved by appropriate 
                action elsewhere, as the GATT had neither the competence nor the responsibility to deal with the political issue 
                which had been raised.  His delegation could not, therefore, accept the notion that there had been a violation of 
                                            4
                the General Agreement”.  The representative of Australia “stated that the Australian measures were in conformity 
                with the provisions of Article XXI:(c), which did not require notification or justification”.5 The representative of 
                the United States stated that “The General Agreement left to each contracting party the judgment as to what it

                                                                ARTICLE XXI - SECURITY EXCEPTIONS                                          601 
                       
                       
                      considered to be necessary to protect its security interests. The CONTRACTING PARTIES had no power to question 
                      that judgement”.6 
                       
                            The representative of Argentina noted that it had attempted to submit to GATT only the trade aspects of this 
                      case and stated “that in order to justify restrictive measures a contracting party invoking Article XXI would 
                      specifically be required to state reasons of national security … there were no trade restrictions which could be 
                                                                                 7
                      applied without being notified, discussed and justified”.   
                       
                            Paragraph 7(iii) of the Ministerial Declaration adopted 29 November 1982 at the Thirty-eighth Session of 
                      the CONTRACTING PARTIES provides that “… the contracting parties undertake, individually and jointly: … to 
                      abstain from taking restrictive trade measures, for reasons of a non-economic character, not consistent with the 
                                             8
                      General Agreement”.  
                       
                            The question of whether and to what extent the CONTRACTING PARTIES can review the national security 
                      reasons for measures taken under Article XXI was discussed again in the GATT Council in May and July 1985 in 
                                                                                                                          9
                      relation to the US trade embargo against Nicaragua which had taken effect on 7 May 1985.  While a panel was 
                      established to examine the US measures, its terms of reference stated that “the Panel cannot examine or judge the 
                      validity or motivation for the invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) by the United States”.10  In the Panel Report on 
                      “United States - Trade Measures affecting Nicaragua”, which has not been adopted,  
                       
                            “… The Panel noted that, while both parties to the dispute agreed that the United States, by imposing the 
                            embargo,  had  acted  contrary  to  certain  trade-facilitating  provisions  of  the  General  Agreement,  they 
                            disagreed  on  the  question  of  whether  the  non-observance  of  these  provisions  was  justified  by 
                            Article XXI(b)(iii) … 
                       
                                  “The Panel further noted that, in the view of Nicaragua, this provision should be interpreted in the 
                            light of the basic principles of international law and in harmony with the decisions of the United Nations 
                            and of the International Court of Justice and should therefore be regarded as merely providing contracting 
                            parties subjected to an aggression with the right of self-defence. The Panel also noted that, in the view of 
                            the  United  States,  Article XXI  applied  to  any  action  which  the  contracting  party  taking  it  considered 
                            necessary for the protection of its essential security interests and that the Panel, both by the terms of 
                            Article XXI and by its mandate, was precluded from examining the validity of the United States’ invocation 
                            of Article XXI. 
                       
                                  “The Panel did not consider the question of whether the terms of Article XXI precluded it from 
                            examining the validity of the United States’ invocation of that Article as this examination was precluded by 
                            its mandate. It recalled that its terms of reference put strict limits on its activities because they stipulated 
                            that  the  Panel  could  not  examine  or  judge  the  validity  of  or  the  motivation  for  the  invocation  of 
                            Article XXI:(b)(iii) by the United States … The Panel concluded that, as it was not authorized to examine 
                            the justification for the United States’ invocation of a general exception to the obligations under the General 
                            Agreement, it could find the United States neither to be complying with its obligations under the General 
                            Agreement nor to be failing to carry out its obligations under that Agreement”.11  
                       
                      2.    Paragraph (a): “furnish … any information” 
                       
                            During the discussion at the Third Session of a Czechoslovak complaint concerning United States national 
                      security export controls, in response to a request by Czechoslovakia for information under Article XIII:3 on the 
                      export licensing system concerned, the US representative stated that while it would comply with a substantial part 
                      of the request, “Article XXI … provides that a contracting party shall not be required to give information which it 
                      considers contrary to its essential security interests. The United States does consider it contrary to its security

                     The “Decision Concerning Article XXI of the General Agreement” of 30 November 1982 (see page 605 
               below) provides inter alia that “Subject to the exception in Article XXI:a, contracting parties should be informed 
               to the fullest extent possible of trade measures taken under Article XXI”.13

               (1)   “relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived” 
                
                     The records of the Geneva discussions of the Preparatory Committee indicate that the representative of 
               Australia withdrew its reservation on the inclusion of a reference to “fissionable materials” in the light of a 
                                                                                                                            14
               statement that the provisions of Article 35 [XXIII] would apply to Article XXI; see below at page 606.  
                
               (2)   “relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods 
                     and  materials  as  is  carried  on  directly  or  indirectly  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  a  military 
                     establishment” 
                
                     During discussions in the Geneva session of the Preparatory Committee, in connection with a proposal to 
               modify Article 37(g) [XX(g)] to permit export restrictions on raw materials for long-term defense purposes, the 
               question  was put whether the phrase “for the purpose of supplying a military establishment” would permit 
               restrictions on the export of iron ore when it was believed that the ore would be used by ordinary smelting works 
               and ultimately for military purposes by another country. It was stated in response that “if a Member exporting 
               commodities is satisfied that the purpose of the transaction was to supply a military establishment, immediately 
               or ultimately, this language would cover it”.15  
                
                     At the Third Session in 1949, Czechoslovakia requested a decision under Article XXIII as to whether the 
               US had failed to carry out its obligations under Articles I and XIII, by reason of the 1948 US administration of 
               its export licensing controls (both short-supply controls and new export controls instituted in 1948 discriminating 
               between destination countries for security reasons). The US stated that its controls for security reasons applied to 
               a  narrow group of exports of goods which could be used for military purposes16 and also stated that “the 
               provisions of Article I would not require uniformity of formalities, as applied to different countries, in respect of 
               restrictions imposed for security reasons”.17 It was also stated by one contracting party that “goods which were of 
                                                                                                                 18
               a nature that could contribute to war potential” came within the exception of Article XXI.  The complaint was 
               rejected by a roll-call vote of 17 to 1 with 3 abstentions.19 
                
               (3)   “taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations” 
                
                     The 1970 Working Party Report on “Accession of the United Arab Republic” notes that in response to 
               concerns raised regarding the Arab League boycott against Israel and the secondary boycott against firms 
               having relations with Israel, the representative of the UAR stated that “the history of the Arab boycott was 
               beyond doubt related to the extraordinary circumstances to which the Middle East area had been exposed. The 
               state of war which had long prevailed in that area necessitated the resorting to this system. … In view of the 
               political character of this issue, the United Arab Republic did not wish to discuss it within GATT. … It would 
               not be reasonable to ask that the United Arab Republic should do business with a firm that transferred all or

                      working  party  supported  the  views  of  the  representative  of  the  UAR  that  the  background  of  the  boycott 
                                                                   21
                      measures was political and not commercial.  
                       
                           In November 1975 Sweden introduced a global import quota system for certain footwear. The Swedish 
                      Government considered that the measure was taken in conformity with the spirit of Article XXI and stated, 
                      inter alia, that the “decrease in domestic production has become a critical threat to the emergency planning of 
                      Sweden’s economic defence as an integral part of the country’s security policy. This policy necessitates the 
                      maintenance of a minimum domestic production capacity in vital industries. Such a capacity is indispensable in 
                      order to secure the provision of essential products necessary to meet basic needs in case of war or other 
                      emergency  in  international  relations”.22  In  the  discussion  of  this  measure  in  the  GATT  Council,  “Many 
                      representatives … expressed doubts as to the justification of these measures under the General Agreement … 
                      Many delegations reserved their rights under the GATT and took note of Sweden’s offer to consult”.23 Sweden 
                      notified the termination of the quotas as far as leather and plastic shoes were concerned as of 1 July 1977.24 
                       
                           In April 1982, the EEC and its member states, Canada, and Australia suspended indefinitely imports into 
                      their territories of products of Argentina. In notifying these measures they stated that “they have taken certain 
                      measures in the light of the situation addressed in the Security Council Resolution 502 [the Falkland/Malvinas 
                      issue]; they have taken these measures on the basis of their inherent rights of which Article XXI of the General 
                      Agreement is a reflection”.25 Argentina took the position that, in addition to infringing the principles and 
                      objectives underlying the GATT, these measures were in violation of Articles I:1, II, XI:1, XIII, and Part IV. 
                      The legal aspects of these trade restrictions affecting Argentina were discussed extensively in the Council.26  
                      The measures were removed in June 1982. Argentina sought an interpretation of Article XXI; these efforts led 
                      to the inclusion of paragraph 7(iii) in the Ministerial Declaration of November 1982, which provides that “… 
                      the contracting parties undertake, individually and jointly: … to abstain from taking restrictive trade measures, 
                      for reasons of a non-economic character, not consistent with the General Agreement”27 and also led to the 
                      adoption of the text below at page 605. 
                       
                           On 7 May 1985 the US notified the contracting parties of an Executive Order prohibiting all imports of 
                      goods and services of Nicaraguan origin, all exports from the US of goods to or destined for Nicaragua 
                      (except those destined for the organized democratic resistance) and transactions relating thereto.28 In Council 
                      discussions of this matter, Nicaragua stated that these measures contravened Articles I, II, V, XI, XIII and 
                      Part IV of the GATT, and that “this was not a matter of national security but one of coercion”.29 Nicaragua 
                      further  stated  that  Article XXI  could  not  be  applied  in  an  arbitrary  fashion;  there  had  to  be  some 
                      correspondence between the measures adopted and the situation giving rise to such adoption.30  Nicaragua 
                      stated that the text of Article XXI made it clear that the CONTRACTING PARTIES were competent to judge 
                      whether a situation of “war or other emergency in international relations” existed and requested that a Panel be 
                                                                            31
                      set up under Article XXIII:2 to examine the issue.  The United States stated that its actions had been taken 
                      for national security reasons and were covered by Article XXI:(b)(iii) of the GATT; and that this provision left 
                      it  to  each contracting party to judge what action it considered necessary for the protection of its essential 
                                       32
                      security interest.  The terms of reference of the Panel precluded it from examining or judging the validity of 
                      the invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) by the US. Concerning the Panel decision on this issue, see page 601 and 
                      the discussion of Article XXIII below. When the Council discussed the Panel Report, Nicaragua requested that 
                      the Council recommend removal of the embargo; authorize special support measures for Nicaragua so that 
                      countries wanting to do so could grant trade preferences aimed at re-establishing a balance in Nicaragua’s pre-
                      embargo global trade relations and at compensating Nicaragua for the damage caused by the embargo; and

               604                                        ANALYTICAL INDEX OF THE GATT 
                
                
               prepare an interpretative note on Article XXI. Consensus was not reached on any of these alternatives. The 
               Panel Report has not been adopted.  At the meeting of the Council on 3 April 1990 Nicaragua announced the 
               lifting  of  the  trade  embargo.  The  representative  of  the  US  announced  that  the  conditions  which  had 
               necessitated action under Article XXI had ceased to exist, his country’s national security emergency with 
               respect to Nicaragua had been terminated, and all economic sanctions, including the trade embargo, had been 
               lifted.33  
                
                    In November 1991, the European Community notified the contracting parties that the EC and its member 
               States had decided to adopt trade measures against Yugoslavia “on the grounds that the situation prevailing in 
               Yugoslavia no longer permits the preferential treatment of this country to be upheld. Therefore, as from 11 
               November, imports from Yugoslavia into the Community are applied m.f.n. treatment … These measures are 
               taken by the European Community upon consideration of its essential security interests and based on GATT 
               Article XXI.”34  The  measures  comprised  suspension of  trade  concessions  granted  to  the  Socialist  Federal 
               Republic of Yugoslavia under its bilateral trade agreement with the EC; application of certain limitations 
               (previously suspended) to textile imports from Yugoslavia; withdrawal of GSP benefits; suspension of similar 
               concessions and GSP benefits for ECSC products; and action to denounce or suspend the application of the 
               bilateral  trade  agreements  between  the  EC  and  its  member  states  and  Yugoslavia.  On  2  December  the 
               Community and its member states decided to apply selective measures in favour of “those parties which 
               contribute  to  progress  toward  peace”.  Economic  sanctions  or  withdrawal  of  preferential  benefits  from  the 
               Yugoslavia were also taken by Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, 
               Switzerland, and the United States.  
                
                    At  the  Forty-seventh  Session  in  December  1991,  Yugoslavia  referred  to  the  Decision  of  1982  on 
               notification  of  measures taken under Article XXI (see page 605 below) and reserved its GATT rights. In 
               February 1992 Yugoslavia requested establishment of a panel under Article XXIII:2, stating that the measures 
               taken by the EC were inconsistent with Articles I, XXI and the Enabling Clause; departed from the letter and 
               intention of paragraph 7(iii) of the Ministerial Decision of November 1982; and impeded the attainment of the 
               objectives of the General Agreement. Yugoslavia further stated: 
                
                          “The situation in Yugoslavia is a specific one and does not correspond to the notion and meaning of 
                    Article XXI(b) and (c). There is no decision or resolution of the relevant UN body to impose economic 
                    sanctions  against  Yugoslavia  based  on  the  reasoning  embodied  in  the  UN  Charter….the  ‘positive 
                    compensatory  measures’  applied  by  the  European  Community  to  certain  parts  of  Yugoslavia  [are] 
                    contrary to the MFN treatment of ‘products originating in or destined for the territories’ - taken as a 
                    whole - ‘of all contracting parties’”.35 
                
               In  March  1992,  the  Council  agreed  to  establish  a  panel  with  the  standard  terms  of  reference  unless,  as 
               provided in the Decision of 12 April 1989, the parties agreed otherwise within twenty days.36 At the April 
               1992 Council meeting, in discussion of the notification of the transformation of the Socialist Federal Republic 
               of Yugoslavia (SFRY) into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) consisting of the Republics of Serbia and 
               Montenegro, the EC representative said that until the question of succession to Yugoslavia’s contracting party 
               status had been resolved, the Panel process which had been initiated between the former SFRY and the EC no 
               longer  had  any  foundation  and  could  not  proceed.37  At  the  May  1992  Council  meeting,  in  a  discussion 
               concerning the status of the FRY as a successor to the former SFRY as a contracting party, the Chairman 
               stated that “In these circumstances, without prejudice to the question of who should succeed the former SFRY 
               in the GATT, and until the Council returned to this issue, he proposed that the representative of the FRY 
                                                                                                                 38
               should refrain from participating in the business of the Council”. The Council so agreed.  At the June 1993 
               Council meeting this decision was modified taking into account United Nations General Assembly Resolution

                      and that it shall not participate in the work of the Council and its subsidiary bodies.39  
                       
                      4.    Paragraph (c): “any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the 
                            maintenance of international peace and security” 
                       
                            India’s 1994 background document for simplified balance-of-payments consultations notes that while almost 
                      all of India’s trading partners received most-favoured-nation treatment in the issue of import licences, import 
                      licences were not issued for imports from countries facing UN mandated sanctions, at present Iraq, Fiji, Serbia 
                      and Montenegro”.40 Brazil’s 1994 notification on import licensing notes that the import licensing system of Brazil 
                      applies for goods entering from or exported to any country except for those covered by UN embargoes.41 The 
                      import licensing notification  of Cyprus similarly notes that imports from certain countries are prohibited in 
                      accordance with United Nations resolutions.42 The 1993 licencing notification of Norway notes that all imports 
                                                                         43
                      from Iraq and Serbia/Montenegro are prohibited.  
                       
                      5.    Other invocations of Article XXI  
                       
                            The United States embargo on trade with Cuba, which was imposed by means of Proclamation 3447 by the 
                      President of the United States, dated 3 February 1962, was not formally raised in the CONTRACTING PARTIES but 
                      notified by Cuba in the inventory of non-tariff measures. The United States invoked Article XXI as justification 
                                    44
                      for its action.  
                       
                      6.    Procedures concerning notification of measures under Article XXI 
                       
                            During the Council discussion in 1982 of trade measures for non-economic reasons taken against Argentina 
                      (see  page  603),  it  was  stated  by  the  countries  taking  these  measures  that  “Article XXI  did  not  mention 
                      notification” and that many contracting parties had, in the past, invoked Article XXI without there having been

                      adoption of the Council report to the CONTRACTING PARTIES, in so far as it related to these trade restrictions.  As 
                      a  result,  on  30 November  1982  the  CONTRACTING  PARTIES  adopted  the  following  “Decision  Concerning 
                      Article XXI of the General Agreement”: 
                       
                                  “Considering that the exceptions envisaged in Article XXI of the General Agreement constitute an 
                            important element for safeguarding the rights of contracting parties when they consider that reasons of 
                            security are involved; 
                       
                                  “Noting  that  recourse  to  Article XXI  could  constitute,  in  certain  circumstances,  an  element  of 
                            disruption and uncertainty for international trade and affect benefits accruing to contracting parties under 
                            the General Agreement;

                           “That until such time as the CONTRACTING PARTIES may decide to make a formal interpretation of 
                     Article XXI it is appropriate to set procedural guidelines for its application;  
                
                           The CONTRACTING PARTIES decide that:  
                
                     “1.   Subject to the exception in Article XXI:a, contracting parties should be informed to the fullest extent 
                     possible of trade measures taken under Article XXI. 
                
                     “2.   When action is taken under Article XXI, all contracting parties affected by such action retain their full 
                     rights under the General Agreement. 
                
                     “3.  The Council may be requested to give further consideration to this matter in due course”.47 
                
               See the references to this Decision above in the case of EC measures on trade with Yugoslavia. 
                
               B.    RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE XXI AND OTHER ARTICLES OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT 
                
               1.    Articles I and XIII 
                
                     During the discussion at the Third Session of the complaint of Czechoslovakia that US export controls were 
               administered inconsistently  with  Articles  I  and  XIII  (see  page  602),  the  US  representative  stated  that  these 
               restrictions  were  justified  under  Article XXI(b)(ii).  In  calling  for  a  decision,  the  Chairman  indicated  that 
               Article XXI “embodied exceptions to the general rule contained in Article I”. In a Decision of 8 June 1949 under 
                                                                                                                        48
               Article XXIII:2, the CONTRACTING PARTIES rejected the contention of the Czechoslovak delegation.  
                
               2.    Article XXIII 
                
                     During discussions in Geneva in 1947 in connection with the removal of the provisions now contained in 
               Article XXI and their relocation in a separate exception (Article 94) at the end of the Charter, the question was 
               raised  whether  the  dispute  settlement  provisions  of  Article  35  of  the  New  York  Draft  [XXII/XXIII]  would 
               nevertheless apply. It was stated that “It is true that an action taken by a Member under Article 94 could not be 
               challenged in the sense that it could not be claimed that a Member was violating the Charter; but if that action, 
               even though not in conflict with the terms of Article 94, should affect another Member, I should think that that 
               Member would have the right to seek redress of some kind under Article 35 as it now stands. In other words, 
                                                                                                          49
               there is no exception from the application of Article 35 to this or any other Article”.  The addition of a note to 
               clarify  that  the  provisions  of  paragraph 2  of  Article 35  [XXIII]  applied  to  Article  94  was  rejected  as 
               unnecessary.50 
                
                     See  the  discussion  above  of  the  Czechoslovak  complaint  concerning  export  controls,  in  which  the 
               CONTRACTING PARTIES made a decision under Article XXIII:2 as to “whether the Government of the United 
               States had failed to carry out its obligations under the Agreement through its administration of the issue of export 
               licences”.51 
                
                     During the discussion of the trade restrictions affecting Argentina applied for non-economic reasons, the 
               view was expressed “that the provisions of Article XXI were subject to those of Article XXIII:2”. Argentina 
               reserved its rights under Article XXIII in respect of any injury resulting from trade restrictions applied in the 
               context of Article XXI.52

                            Paragraph 2 of the “Decision Concerning Article XXI of the General Agreement” of 30 November 1982 
                      stipulates that “… when action is taken under Article XXI, all contracting parties affected by such action retain 
                      their full rights under the General Agreement”.53 
                       
                            The 1984 Panel Report on “United States - Imports of Sugar from Nicaragua” examined the action taken by 
                      the US government to reduce the share of the US sugar import quota allocated to Nicaragua and distribute the 
                      reduction in Nicaragua’s allocation to El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Panel Report notes that “The 
                      United States stated that it was neither invoking any exceptions under the provisions of the General Agreement 
                      nor intending to defend its actions in GATT terms … the action of the United States did of course affect trade, 
                                                                   54
                      but was not taken for trade policy reasons”.   
                       
                                  “The  Panel  noted  that  the  measures  taken  by  the  United  States  concerning  sugar  imports  from 
                            Nicaragua were but one aspect of a more general problem. The Panel, in accordance with its terms of 
                            reference … examined those measures solely in the light of the relevant GATT provisions, concerning itself 
                                                                       55
                            only with the trade issue under dispute.”  
                       
                            “… The Panel … concluded that the sugar quota allocated to Nicaragua for the fiscal year 1983/84 was 
                            inconsistent with the United States’ obligations under Article XIII:2. 
                       
                                  “The Panel noted that the United States had not invoked any of the exceptions provided for in the 
                            General Agreement permitting discriminatory quantitative restrictions contrary to Article XIII. The Panel 
                            therefore did not examine whether the reduction in Nicaragua’s quota could be justified under any such 
                            provision.”56 
                       
                      The follow-up on the Panel report was discussed in the Council meetings of May and July 1984. The United 
                      States said that it “had not obstructed Nicaragua’s resort to GATT’s dispute settlement process; it had stated 
                      explicitly the conditions under which the issue might be resolved; and it recognized that Nicaragua had certain 
                      rights under Article XXIII which it had reserved and could continue to exercise”.57 Nicaragua stated that it was 
                      aware of its rights under Article XXIII.  
                       
                            In July 1985, following a request by Nicaragua for the establishment of a panel to review certain US trade 
                      measures  affecting  Nicaragua,  the  right  of  a  contracting  party  to  invoke  Article XXIII  in  cases  involving 
                      Article XXI was discussed again in the GATT Council.58 At its meetings in October 1985 and March 1986 
                      respectively the Council established a panel with the following terms of reference to deal with the complaint by 
                      Nicaragua:  
                       
                            “To examine, in the light of the relevant GATT provisions, of the understanding reached at the Council on 
                            10 October 1985 that the Panel cannot examine or judge the validity of or motivation for the invocation of 
                            Article XXI(b)(iii)  by  the  United  States,  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Understanding  Regarding 
                            Notification,  Consultation,  Dispute  Settlement  and  Surveillance  (BISD  26S/211-218),  and  of  the  agreed 
                            Dispute  Settlement  Procedures  contained  in  the  1982  Ministerial  Declaration  (BISD  29S/13-16),  the 
                            measures taken by the United States on 7 May 1985 and their trade effects in order to establish to what 
                            extent benefits accruing to Nicaragua under the General Agreement have been nullified or impaired, and to 
                                                                                                                             59
                            make such findings as will assist the CONTRACTING PARTIES in further action in this matter”.  
                       
                      In the Panel Report on “United States - Trade Measures affecting Nicaragua”, which has not been adopted, the 
                      Panel  noted  the  different  views  of  the  parties  regarding  whether  the  United  States’  invocation  of 
                      Article XXI(b)(iii) was proper, and concluded that this issue was not within its terms of reference; see above at 
                      page 601. With regard to Nicaragua’s claim of non-violation nullification or impairment, the Panel “decided not

                     When the Panel’s report was discussed by the Council in November 1986, the US representative stated that 
               “Nullification or impairment when no GATT violation had been found was a delicate issue, linked to the concept 
               of ‘reasonable expectations’. It was not simply a question of trade damage, since no one doubted the existence of 
               trade  damage.  Applying  the  concept  of  ‘reasonable  expectations’  to  a  case  of  trade  sanctions  motivated  by 
               national  security  considerations  would  be  particularly  perilous,  since  at  a  broader  level  those  security 
               considerations would nevertheless enter into expectations … the Panel had acted wisely in refraining from a 
               decision  that  could  create  a  precedent  of  much  wider  ramifications  for  the  scope  of  GATT  rights  and 
               obligations …”.61 The representative of Nicaragua stated that her delegation could not support adoption of the 
               report,  inter  alia  because  it  could  only  be  adopted  once  the  Council  was  in  a  position  to  make 
               recommendations.62  
                
               C.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTICLE XXI AND GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW 
                
                     The 1986 Panel Report on “United States - Trade Measures Affecting Nicaragua”, which has not been 
               adopted, notes the different views of the parties to the dispute concerning the relationship between Article XXI 
               and general international law including decisions of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice.63 
                
                     In discussion at the Forty-seventh Session in December 1991 concerning trade measures for non-economic 
               purposes against Yugoslavia, the representative of India stated that “India did not favour the use of trade measures 
               for non-economic reasons. Such measures should only be taken within the framework of a decision by the United 
               Nations Security Council. In the absence of such a decision or resolution, there was a serious risk that such 
               measures might be unilateral or arbitrary and would undermine the multilateral trading system”.64 
                
                
               III.  PREPARATORY WORK  
                
                     In the US Draft Charter, and London and New York Draft Charter texts, the Article on exceptions to the 
               commercial policy chapter included the provisions of what is now GATT Article XXI (see Article 32, US draft; 
               Article  37,  London  and  New  York  drafts).  Also  in  these  drafts,  the  exceptions  clause  for  the  chapter  on 
               commodity agreements included provisions excepting arrangements relating to fissionable materials; to the traffic 
               in arms, ammunition and implements of war and traffic in goods and materials for the purpose of supplying a 
               military establishment; or in time of war or other emergency in international relations, to the protection of the 
               essential security interests of a member (Article 49:2, US Draft; Article 59(2), London Draft; Article 59(c), New 
               York Draft). At Geneva it was decided to take paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (k) of Article 37 and place them in a 
               separate Article.65 It was agreed that this Article would be a general exception applicable to the entire Charter.66 
               The corresponding security exception was also removed from the commodity chapter. The security exception 
               provisions became Article 94 in Chapter VII of the Geneva draft Charter, which was virtually identical to the 
               present text of Article XXI. 
                
                     The text  of  Article  94  was  extensively  discussed  at  Havana  in  the  Sixth  Committee  on  Organization. 
               Article 94 became Article 99 of the Charter on General Exceptions, of which paragraphs 1(a) and (b) were 
               almost  identical  to  those  of  Article XXI,  the  only  differences  being  (i)  an  addition  in  the  first  line  of 
               paragraph (b) as follows: “to prevent any Member from taking, either singly or with other States, any action …”, 
               and (ii) an addition to paragraph (b)(ii) as follows: “a military establishment of any other country”.  Article 99 
               also included a paragraph 1(c) exempting intergovernmental military supply agreements67; a paragraph 1(d) on

                      trade  relations  between  India  and  Pakistan  (dealt  with  in  the  General  Agreement  by  the  provisions  of 
                      Article XXIV:11); and a paragraph 2 providing that nothing in the Charter would override the provisions of peace 
                      treaties  resulting  from  the  Second  World  War  or  UN  instruments  creating  trust  territories  or  other  special 
                      regimes.  
                       
                            However, “on examining several of  the  proposals  submitted  by  delegations  relating  to  action  taken  in 
                      connection with political matters or with the essential interests of Members, the Committee concluded that the 
                      provisions regarding such action should be made in connection with an article on ‘Relations with the United 
                      Nations’, since the question of the proper allocation of responsibility as between the Organization and the United 
                      Nations was involved”.68 Accordingly a new Article 86 of the Charter on “Relations with the United Nations” 
                      was drafted, including the former paragraph 1(c) of Article 94 [XXI:(c)].  
                       
                            Article 86 of the Charter dealt with various institutional questions such as the conclusion of a specialized 
                      agency agreement between the ITO and the UN. It also stated, in paragraphs 3 and 4, that: 
                       
                            “3.  The Members recognize that the Organization should not attempt to take action which would involve 
                            passing judgement in any way on essentially political matters. Accordingly, and in order to avoid conflict of 
                            responsibility between the United Nations and the Organization with respect to such matters, any measure 
                            taken by a Member directly in connection with a political matter brought before the United Nations in 
                            accordance with the provisions of Chapters IV or VI of the United Nations Charter shall be deemed to fall 
                            within the scope of the United Nations, and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Charter. 
                       
                            “4.  No action, taken by a Member in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for 
                            the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security, shall be deemed to conflict with the 
                            provisions of this Charter”.  
                       
                      The interpretative notes to paragraph 3 provided that:  
                       
                            “1.  If any Member raises the question whether a measure is in fact taken directly in connection with a 
                            political matter brought before the United Nations in accordance with the provisions of Chapters IV or VI 
                            of the United Nations Charter, the responsibility for making a determination on the question shall rest with 
                            the Organization. If, however, political issues beyond the competence of the Organization are involved in 
                            making such a determination, the question shall be deemed to fall within the scope of the United Nations. 
                       
                            “2.  If a Member which has no direct political concern in a matter brought before the United Nations 
                            considers that a measure taken directly in connection therewith and falling within the scope of paragraph 3 
                            of Article 86 constitutes a nullification or impairment within the terms of paragraph 1 of Article 93, it shall 
                            seek redress only by recourse to the procedures set forth in Chapter VIII of this Charter”. 
                       
                      The purpose of these provisions was explained by the Sixth Committee as follows: 
                       
                            “Paragraph 3 of Article [86], which like paragraph 4 is independent in its operation, is designed to deal 
                            with any measure which is directly in connection with a political matter brought before the United Nations 
                            in a manner which will avoid conflict of responsibility between the United Nations and the Organization 
                            with  respect  to  political  matters.  The  Committee  agreed  that  this  provision  would  cover  measures 
                            maintained by a Member even though another Member had brought the particular matter before the United 
                            Nations, so long as the measure was taken directly in connection with the matter. It was also agreed that 
                            such a measure, as well as the political matter with which it was directly connected, should remain within 
                            the jurisdiction of the United Nations and not within that of the Organization. The Committee was of the 
                            opinion that the important thing was to maintain the jurisdiction of the United Nations over political matters 
                            and over economic measures of this sort taken directly in connection with such a political matter, and 
                            nothing in Article [86] could be held to prejudice the freedom of action of the United Nations to settle such 
                            matters and to take steps to deal with such economic measures in accordance with the provisions of the 
                            Charter of the United Nations if they see fit to do so.

                     “It was the view of the Committee that the word ‘measure’ in paragraph 3 of Article [86] refers only to a 
                     measure which is taken directly in connection with a political matter brought before the United Nations in 
                     accordance with Chapters IV and VI of the Charter of the United Nations and does not refer to any other 
                     measure”.69  
                
               The Charter provisions in Articles 86 and 99 were not taken into the General Agreement. While Article XXIX:1 
               provides that “The contracting parties undertake to observe … the general principles of Chapters I to VI inclusive 
               and of Chapter IX of the Havana Charter”, the Note Ad Article XXIX:1 provides that “Chapters VII and VIII … 
               have been excluded from paragraph 1 because they generally deal with the organization, functions and procedures 
               of the International Trade Organization”. In this connection, during the discussion at the Sixth Session of the 
               CONTRACTING PARTIES of the US suspension of trade relations with Czechoslovakia it was stated with reference to 
               Article 86, paragraph 3 of the Havana Charter that “although Chapter VII of the Charter was not specifically 
               included  by  reference  in  Article XXIX  of  the  Agreement,  it  had  surely  been  the  general  intention  that  the 
               principles of the Charter should be guiding ones for the CONTRACTING PARTIES”.70 
                
                     The present text of Article XXI dates from the 30 October 1948 Geneva Final Act. It has never been 
               amended. Amendment of Article XXI was neither proposed nor discussed in the 1954-55 Review Session.
