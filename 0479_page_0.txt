             What is the New Medicine Service? 
             The New Medicine Service is a free NHS service, offered through your pharmacy (chemist), to 
             help you understand your condition and get the most out of your new medicine.  
              
             Who is it for? 
             The service is for people who have received their first prescription for a medicine to treat any of 
             the following conditions: 
                       asthma

                       type 2 diabetes 
                       high blood pressure

             How will it help me? 
             Between 30% and 50% of prescribed medicines are not taken as recommended. This means 
             that a lot of medicines are wasted or are not as effective as they could be. 
             The service will: 
                   -    help you to find out more about the new medicine you are taking 
                   -    help to sort out any problems you are having with your new medicine 
                   -    give you a chance to ask questions about your medicine and discuss any concerns 
                   -    help to improve the effectiveness of your new medicine, for example, there may be an 
                        easier or better way to take it 
                   -    help you to make your own decisions about managing your condition 
                   -    help you to improve your health, which could lead to fewer GP and hospital visits. 
             The New Medicine Service will help provide better value for you and the NHS by making sure 
             that your medicines are right for you. 
              
             How does the service work? 
             When you are given your new medicine you will be asked if you want to sign up to the service, 
             which will be provided in three parts.  If you agree, you will need to sign a consent form to allow 
             your pharmacist to share your information with other parts of the NHS (see below).
