        Getting ready with data
        Getting ready with data
         Gather all important data,  analyses, plots and tables
         Organize results so that they follow a logical sequence (this may 
         or may not be in the order of experiments conducted)
         Consolidate data plots and create figures for the manuscript
         (Limit the number of total figures (6-8 is usually a good number). 
         Include additional data, multimedia in the Supporting Information.)
         Discuss the data with your advisor and note down important 
         points
       Important: KNOWthe focus of your paper
      It takes a wise man to know whether he 
      has found a ROPE or LOST A MULE.

              First draft
              Identify two or three important findings emerging from the 
              experiments. Make them the central theme of the article.
              Note good and bad writing styles in the literature. Some are simple 
              and easy to follow, some are just too complex.
              Note the readership of the journal that you are considering to 
              publish your work
              Prepare figures, schemes and tables in a professional manner
                 (Pay attention to quantification of data accuracy, significant digits, 
                 error bars,)

                       First couple of sentences should focus on what the study is about.  Include 
                       major findings in a style that a general readership can read and understand 
                       (i.e., avoid detailed experimental procedures and data.) Keep it short and 
                       effective.

                                                                   8 7

                         electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). We have shown that 
                         the formation and size of  aggregates is dependent on th e nature of the anion 
                         and cation. Solvent structuring in select PILs through aggregation can 
                         contribute to their classification as “poor ionic liquids” and can also strongly 
                         influence the entropic co mponent to the free ener gy of amphiphile self-

            Describe the results in detail and include a healthy, detailed 
            discussion
            The order of figures should follow the discussion themes and not
            the sequence they were conducted
            Discuss how your data compare or contrast with previous results.
            Include schemes, photographs to enhance the scope of discussion

         Selecting a journal
         Selecting a journal
         Each journal specializes in a specific area of research. Hence its 
         readership varies.  A proper choice of journal can make a larger
         impact of your research.
         Get to know the focus and readership of the journal that you are
         considering. - general vs. specialized area journal
         Select 2 or 3 journals in the chosen  area with relatively high impact 
         factors. Discuss with your advisor and decide on the journal 
         Find out the journal’s submission criteria and format
         Tip: Does your references cite journals in the appropriate area?

        Submission
        Submission
        Read the finalized paper carefully. Check for accuracy of figures and 
        captions.  Are the figures correctly referred to in the text?
        Get feedback from advisor and colleagues.
        Make sure the paper is read by at least one or two colleagues who is 
        not familiar with the specific work.
        Provide a cover letter to the edit or along with a brief paragraph 
        highlighting the importance of this work and names of possible 
        reviewers.
        Have all coauthors approve the finalized version of the paper
        Submit the paper online along with copyright form.
        Revision and galley proof
        Revision and galley proof
         The manuscript is usually reviewed by 2-3 reviewers
         Reviewers point out deficiencies and/or suggestions to improve the 
        scientific content
         Read their comments carefully. (If reviewer misunderstands a point, 
        the point probably needs revision or additional support.) 
         -Do not blame the reviewer for his/her misunderstanding!
         Be polite and respectful when disagreeing a reviewer’s comment
         Include a point-by-point explanation of changes made in the text in 
        response to reviewers’ comments
         Once again, carefully read the paper for its accuracy in presenting 
        the data
         Submit the revised version 
         Once accepted for publication you should receive the galley proof 
        within a month. This is one last chance to make any final 
        corrections.
       What to do if a paper gets rejected……
         Do not get discouraged. Read editorial comments and discuss 
         with advisor/students/collaborators. Find out how you can make 
         this study stronger and acceptable for publication.
         Do not just turn around and submit the paper to another journal.
         Read carefully the comments and find ways to improve the 
         scientific quality of the papers
         Carry out additional experiments and improve the quality of 
         scientific discussions. (Journals often look for papers with 
         quantitative and mechanistic information that represent new 
         physical insights )
         Rejected papers can be resubmitted if and only the concerns of 
         the reviewers are adequately addressed and new results are 
         included. 
         If you have questions, please feel free to contact the 
         editorial office.
       What to Avoid?
         Data without scientific discussion, applications of data, or 
         reviews of the literature are not sufficient .  
         Routine synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials or 
         studies that report incremental advance are not considered 
         suitable for publication.
         Use of the phrase “Novel”or “First-time” in the title or 
         abstract.  Such descriptions do not impress the reader or 
         the reviewer.
         (Other over used phrases “One-pot synthesis”, “Facile”)
         Names of flowers, fruits and vegetables to describe the 
         nanoparticle/nanostructure shapes/morphology
         To do even better ….
        The authors should make every effort to make a 
        good presentation with proper usage of English 
        grammar. 
        Ask a colleague to comment on your paper before 
        sending it for publication.
        “English is not my Native Language” is not a valid 
        justification for reviewer who cannot comprehend.
        Reviewers do not wish to review papers that are not 
        readable. Badly written papers are often 
        recommended as “REJECT”by the Reviewers
        ACS Publication office helps to edit the language for 
        accepted manuscripts, but this only happens if the 
        English was good enough to be reviewed.

        1. Avoid Focus
        2. Avoid originality and personality
        3. Make the article really really long
        4. Do not indicate any potential implications
        5. Leave out illustrations (…too much effort to draw a 
            sensible drawing)
        6. Omit necessary steps of reasoning
        7. Use abbreviations and technical terms that only 
          specialists in the field can understand
        8. Make it sound too serious with no significant 
          discussion
        9. Focus only on statistics
        10.Support every statement with a reference
