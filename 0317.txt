                 to  Internet  resources  (e.g.,  web  pages,  images,  videos)  without       tools where the act of tagging a resource is similar to categorizing 
                 relying  on  a  controlled  vocabulary.    Tagging  systems  have  the        personal bookmarks. In this model, tags allow users to store and

                 hubs and authorities as a bi-partite graph, similar to the way we               reference.  There are many other tagging systems in existence, but

                 resource, can be considered to have a similar role to tags in our 
                 model.  Traditionally,  the  anchor  text  is  associated  with  the            • Yahoo!  MyWeb2.0  (http://myweb.yahoo.com):  similar  to
