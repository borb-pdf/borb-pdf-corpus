                                     You can apply for a credit card if you’re a permanent UK resident aged 18 years or over, have a gross annual income of £7,500 or more,

                                     to refuse any application. You can’t apply for an Everyday Credit Card if you already have one of our red Santander credit cards and are the
                                     main cardholder.

            Understanding your credit card agreement (continued)
                How much will I have to pay under the credit                           Put simply

                                                                                       payments. It will cost you less if you pay off the full balance quickly.
                The total amount you have to repay each month will depend 
                on how much you spend using your credit card and how much 
                of the outstanding balance you repay each month. 
                Every month, you can repay as much of the balance as you like 
                but you must pay at least the minimum payment which will 
                be a percentage of the balance outstanding. Your minimum 
                payment will be shown on your statement each month as 
                well as the date by when you must pay. Details of how your 
                minimum payment is calculated are set out in the Key Features 
                section of your Pre-Contract Credit Information. 
                If you only pay the minimum payment each month you will be 
                charged interest and it will take you longer, and cost you more 
                overall, to clear your balance.
                If for two consecutive 18 month periods, you pay off less of 
                the principal amount of the transactions added to your account 
                than you pay in interest, fees and charges then we will have to 
                change the way you repay and may also need to restrict your 
                use of the account. We will have to do this even if you have not 
                breached the terms of your agreement.
