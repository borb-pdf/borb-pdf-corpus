                             Neighbors, Communities and Pipelines Safe
          In Case of Emergency
          Pipeline leaks are rare, but being able to recognize and respond to a suspected leak or rupture is an important 
          part of living and working safely around underground pipelines.  Your personal safety should be your ﬁ rst con-
          cern should you encounter any of these signs or conditions. 
          Signs of a natural gas pipeline RUPTURE: 
           • Loud roaring or explosive sound; OR 
           • Very large ﬂ ames and loud roaring noise. 
          Follow these steps:
            If there are no ﬂ ames present:
           • Immediately evacuate the area 
           •  Do not start or turn off motor vehicles or electrical equipment (such as 
            cell phones, pagers, two-way radios, or lights) as this could cause the gas to ignite 
           • Abandon any equipment being used in or near the area 
           • Move far enough away from the noise until you can have a normal conversation 
           • Discourage others from entering the area 
           •  From this safe location, call 911 or contact the local ﬁ re department or law enforcement and
           • Notify the operator of the pipeline 
            If ﬂ ames are present
           • Move behind a structure that provides protection until there is a reduction in noise
           • Plan a route away from the ﬁ re that offers shelter
           • Driving away from the area is acceptable
           • Move far enough away from the ﬂ ames until you feel comfortable 
           • Discourage others from entering the area 
           •  From this safe location, call 911 or contact the local ﬁ re department or law enforcement and
           • Notify the operator of the pipeline 
          Any one of these is a sign of a suspected natural gas pipeline LEAK: 
           • Whistling or hissing sound; 
           • Distinctive, strong odor, often compared to rotten eggs; 
           • Dense fog, mist or white cloud; 
           • Bubbling in water, ponds or creeks; 
           • Dust or dirt blowing up from the ground; or
           • Discolored or dead vegetation above the pipeline right of way. 
          Follow these steps:
           • Carefully evacuate the immediate area to where you can no longer hear, see or smell the gas 
            • Avoid introducing any sources of ignition in the area 
            •  Do not start or turn off motor vehicles or electrical equipment (such as cell phones, pagers, two-way 
            radios, or lights) as this could cause a spark 
           • Abandon any equipment being used in or near the area 
           • Avoid any open ﬂ ames 
           • Discourage others from entering the area 
           • Call 911 or contact the local ﬁ re department or law enforcement from a safe location 
           • Notify the operator of the pipeline 
          Two important things to remember:
           • Do not attempt to extinguish a natural gas ﬁ re 
           • Do not attempt to operate any pipeline valves or equipment

                 Natural Gas Pipeline Safety – It’s a Shared Responsibility 
                 Serious accidents on interstate natural gas pipelines are rare.  But when 
                 leaks or ruptures occur, they can cause signiﬁ cant harm to persons and 
                 property.  
                 Pipeline safety is a responsibility that’s shared among many people, 
                 including pipeline company personnel, the federal and state agen-
                 cies that oversee natural gas pipelines, public safety ofﬁ cials and 
                 -- equally as important -- our neighbors who live and work near 
                 pipelines.  
                       That’s why YOU are an integral part of the safe operation of natural 
                       gas pipelines. 
                       If there is a pipeline in your community, you need to: 1) be informed 
                      of where the pipeline facilities are located; 2) be aware of activities 
                      around these facilities, especially anything that appears to be out of the 
                    ordinary; and 3) be responsive by knowing what action to take in the unlike-
                    ly event of an emergency or the presence of unusual or suspicious activity. 
                 Here’s how you can be informed, aware and responsive:
                    Find out if a transmission pipeline is on or near your property
                  •  Check the National Pipeline Mapping System Public Map Viewer at www.
                   npms.phmsa.dot.gov
                  •  Look for pipeline markers -- these are signs, located at regular intervals, that 
                   include information about the transmission pipeline operator 
                  •  Read any mailings you receive from pipeline companies -- if you get them, that 
                   means there’s a pipeline in your area 
                    Use the One-Call System before you do any type of excavation
                  •  Call 811 Before You Dig so underground pipes and utilities are 
                   properly identiﬁ ed and marked -- Section 5 provides more infor-
                   mation on One-Call
                  •  Excavate carefully around any pipeline facilities
                  •  Inform the One-Call System and pipeline operator of possible 
                   unmarked excavation or pipeline damage that may have been 
                   caused by digging
                    Familiarize yourself with pipeline events and how to respond
                  • Read the previous page -- In Case of Emergency
                  • Post this page in your home or business
                  •  Report any unusual or suspicious activities in or around pipeline facilities by 
                   calling 911 and the pipeline operator, using the emergency number from a 
                   pipeline marker, brochure or other materials you have received

                 Our Commitment to the Safe Transportation of Natural Gas 
                 Working together can keep our neighbors, communities and pipelines safe.  
                 We, too, are concerned about any leak or rupture that could harm people 
                 or property.  We work hard to prevent incidents from occurring. 
                 We are the member companies of the Interstate Natural Gas Association 
                 of America (INGAA), and it is our responsibility to embrace pipeline 
                 safety by implementing stringent safety programs and practices 
                 every step of the way.  Safety is our core value, and the following 
                 principles guide everything we do: 
                       1.  Our goal is zero incidents - a perfect record of safety and reliability 
                         for the national pipeline system. We will work every day toward 
                         this goal.
                        2.  We are committed to safety culture as a critical dimension to 
                         continuously improve our industry’s performance.
                      3.  We will be relentless in our pursuit of improving by learning from the 
                       past and anticipating the future.
                    4.  We are committed to applying integrity management principles on a 
                     system-wide basis.
                  5.  We will engage our stakeholdersfrom the local community to the national 
                   levelso they understand and can participate in reducing risk.
                 The pages that follow provide information on how we are working to achieve our 
                 goals by monitoring and inspecting our systems, beginning with pipe manufactur-
                 ing and continuing through design, construction and testing, and operations. 
                 Pipelines are the Safest Way to Move 
                 Large Amounts of Energy Long Distance 
                 One way to measure safety performance is to identify the number of accidents 
                 involving a fatality or injury.  For natural gas pipelines, the U.S. Department 
                 of Transportation (DOT) classiﬁ es these as serious incidents.  
                 According to U.S. DOT data, natural gas transmission operators aver-
                 aged ﬁ ve serious incidents per year between 2000 and 2010 along the 
                 approximately 300,000-mile natural gas transmission network. 
                 In its December 2010 report, “Building Safe Communities: Pipe-
                 line Risk and its Application to Local Development Decisions,” the 
                 U.S. DOT’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
                 (PHMSA) noted that transmission pipelines had lower fatality and injury rates than 
                 railway and road transportation when hazardous materials are involved. 
                 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) performs extensive safety studies 
                 in the environmental impact statements (EIS) it conducts prior to approving any new 
                 or expanded interstate pipeline.  In a May 2009 EIS, FERC’s nationwide analysis indi-
                 cated there are far fewer deaths on average each year due to natural gas transmis-
                 sion and gathering pipeline accidents than all other categories of accidental deaths, 
                 including weather-related, poisonings and ﬁ res and burns.  FERC concluded that 
                 “the available data show that natural gas pipelines continue to be a safe, reliable 
                 means of energy transportation.”

                 Natural Gas is Vital
                 North America requires a varied mix of energy sources to serve a growing economy 
                 and population and to meet the demand for clean energy.  Natural gas plays a vital 
                 role in that mix, providing about 25 percent of the daily energy that is consumed in 
                 the United States. 
                  Natural gas is: 
                  •  Versatile...it fuels electric generators that produce about 20 percent of 
                   our electricity; heats and cools 70 million of our homes and businesses; 
                   is a vital component of products such as fertilizer; and powers manu-
                   facturing and transportation. 
                  •  Cleaner burning...it produces 45 percent less carbon dioxide 
                   than coal and 30 percent less carbon dioxide than fuel oil when 
                        it’s burned; it produces no mercury and only trace 
                        amounts of sulfur dioxide; and it produces far less 
                        nitrogen oxide than other fossil fuels. 
                       •  Domestically abundant...nearly all the natural gas consumed in 
                        North America – 98 percent – is produced in the United States and 
                        Canada, with current estimates pointing to enough gas to meet 
                        100 years’ worth of demand. 
                    •  Reliable...it’s available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, regardless of 
                     weather conditions.  
                 For all these reasons, natural gas is a popular fuel choice.  For example, 
                 the number of residential natural gas customers in North America 
                 has grown by 70 percent over the last 40 years to more than 65 
                 million customers.  Interstate pipeline systems provide reliable 
                 supplies to growing local distribution networks that heat mil-
                 lions of homes.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration 
                 forecasts indicate consumption will increase even further over 
                 the next 25 years as demand escalates for clean, domestically 
                 produced energy. 
                 Our own studies project that by 2030, natural gas use in North America will grow 
                 by 18 percent and, depending upon energy markets and public policies, could grow 
                 by as much as 34 percent or more.  Given this anticipated growth, we must con-
                 tinue to build and maintain our interstate pipeline systems to access new domestic 
                 supplies in order to meet demand.  
                 Properties of Natural Gas 
                 Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel that has methane as its primary compound.  It 
                 is derived from organic material that was deposited or buried under the earth mil-
                 lions of years ago.  Natural gas is odorless and colorless and, when mixed with the 
                 requisite volume of air (a 5-15 percent gas-to-air mix is the ﬂ ammable range) and 
                 ignited, it burns with a clean, blue ﬂ ame that generates radiant heat.  It is consid-
                 ered one of the cleanest-burning fuels, producing primarily carbon dioxide and 
                 water vapor.  Before distribution to end-users, natural gas is odorized by adding 
                 mercaptan – a rotten-egg smell - that helps in detecting leaks.  
                 Natural gas is lighter than air and tends to disperse upward if released into the 
                 atmosphere.  A natural gas pipeline rupture can be very dangerous to people and 
                 property because of the force of the gas release, debris from the rupture and the 
                 risk of ﬁ re from the escaping gas.  If a leak is in a conﬁ ned space, such as within a 
                 house, gas concentrations in the ﬂ ammable range can be explosive.

                 Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines 
                 At INGAA, our focus is on the approximately 200,000 miles of transmission 
                 pipelines that cross state borders, delivering natural gas to fuel our economy and 
                 provide jobs.  These are the interstate pipelines. 
                 Operating around the clock, interstate pipelines reliably deliver this essential energy 
                 source to: 
                  • Electric generation plants 
                  •  Local distribution companies that bring the natural gas directly to our homes 
                   and businesses 
                  • Manufacturing plants and businesses 
                 Interstate pipelines carry large amounts of natural gas over thousands of miles.  
                 Facilities located along an interstate pipeline system maintain and monitor the ﬂ ow 
                 of natural gas. 
                 For example, compressor stations, usually located every 50 to 60 miles, 
                 boost natural gas pressure to counteract the pressure lost due to friction 
                 as the gas travels through the pipelines.  Other facilities include metering 
                 stations that measure natural gas volume, regulating stations that 
                 control gas pressure and valves that control gas ﬂ ow through the 
                 pipelines. 
                        From the time natural gas enters the system until 
                        it is delivered, interstate pipelines are controlled and monitored 
                        closely by professional technicians utilizing sophisticated control and 
                        communications systems to make sure they are running safely and 
                      efﬁ ciently.

                      Robust Standards and Comprehensive Regulations
                      Safety is our industry’s top priority.  We live and work in the communities where 
                      natural gas transmission pipelines are located.  Moving natural gas through pipe-
                      lines is our business, and protecting the people, environment and communities 
                      along these pipelines is our commitment.  Safety is our core value.  Our industry is 
                      guided by robust safety standards and operates under comprehensive federal regu-
                      lations that govern all aspects of the pipeline life cycle, including design, construc-
                      tion, materials, testing, operations and maintenance of all natural gas transmission 
                      pipelines. 
                      The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act codiﬁ ed and improved safety practices previ-
                      ously developed by engineering consensus standard organizations such as the 
                      American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Petroleum 
                      Institute (API).  These standards are routinely evaluated and revised to incorporate 
                      new technologies and improved safety practices. 
                      The Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act gives the Ofﬁ ce of Pipeline Safety (OPS), a divi-
                      sion within PHMSA, authority to regulate the safety of interstate natural gas and 
                      hazardous liquid pipelines.  
                       
                       
                                              SAFETY      Every Step of the Way
                      PHMSA - Strengthening Safety Programs
                      As the primary safety regulator of energy pipeline systems, PHMSA administers the 
                      comprehensive federal regulations that address the entire life cycle of pipelines, 
                      providing oversight to keep the public safe. 
                      Since the Pipeline Safety Act was passed in 1968, interstate pipeline operators have 
                      worked cooperatively with PHMSA to research technologies, update regulatory 
                      mandates and develop standards that have made pipeline infrastructure even safer.  
                      This effort has led to the enactment of laws, regulations and practices: 
                        •  All interstate pipeline operators must comply with comprehensive PHMSA 
                         regulations.  PHMSA conducts numerous inspections annually to verify 
                         that regulatory requirements are met. 
                        •  All interstate pipeline companies must have in place Integrity Management 
                         Programs (IMP), which require supplemental safety assessments and mea-
                         sures in more populated areas (deﬁ ned in regulations as “high consequence 
                         areas” or HCAs) along a pipeline system.  Many operators use in-line inspec-
                         tion (ILI) to assess the HCAs on their systems.  ILI tools assess the entire length 
                         of the ILI run, not just the HCAs.  So while the IMP regulations require assess-
                         ments for only 7 percent of the natural gas transmission mileage, approximate-
                               ly 65 percent of the mileage will actually be assessed by the end of 
                               2012.  We respond to all indicators of anomalies -- whether inside 
                               or outside HCAs. 
                               • Excavation damage is the predominant cause of serious natural 
                             gas transmission pipeline incidents that result in fatalities and injuries.  
                             All interstate pipeline companies promote damage prevention laws and 
                             state “Call Before You Dig” programs.  The One-Call system requires 
                           anyone planning to dig to contact the local One-Call ofﬁ ce before any 
                           excavation to locate underground pipes and utilities, excavate carefully 
                           around the pipe, and report any damage that may be caused to the pipeline 
                           or its coating.  With the strong support of INGAA members, this law led to 
                           the creation of the national “811 Call Before You Dig” damage prevention 
                           program, a critically important public awareness initiative that provides a 
                           single, nationwide phone number to obtain detailed information about buried 
                           cables and pipelines in each state.  
                        •  Interstate pipeline operators support the Pipelines and Informed 
                         Planning Alliance (PIPA) report that includes recommended 
                         practices for local development around existing pipelines to 
                         protect pipelines and surrounding communities. 
                        •  Federal regulations require operators to use extensive 
                         Operator Quali cation standards that require a 
                         formal, documented approach to ensuring that 
                         workers who perform safety-related operation 
                         and maintenance tasks on a pipeline system are 
                         qualiﬁ ed to undertake those tasks.  
                        •  Recently, the federal regulations were further 
                         enhanced with rules developed for 
                         Control Room Management.

                                     Sharing in Oversight
                                     Along with PHMSA, others play a signiﬁ cant role in regulating the construction and 
                                     operation of interstate natural gas pipelines: 
                                     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible for the ap-
                                     proval of new interstate natural gas transmission pipeline routing and siting.  FERC 
                                     must determine whether proposed pipeline projects are needed and in the public 
                                     interest.  FERC also requires pipeline companies to certify that projects will comply 
                                     with all PHMSA safety regulations.  The siting process includes input from many 
                                     participating federal agencies, pipeline neighbors and citizens along the proposed 
                                     route to ensure that FERC considers the full range of public interests. 
                                     The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for establishing and 
                                     enforcing any environmental regulations, such as air and water quality, related to 
                                     pipeline companies.  Other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
                                     neers, as well as state and tribal agencies, often evaluate the environmental aspects 
                                     of pipeline construction. 
                                     The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security 
                                     Administration (TSA)    Pipeline Security Division has issued guidelines that describe 
                                     best practices for securing transmission pipeline facilities from malicious damage.  We 
                                     comply with these guidelines and work closely with TSA in monitoring and securing  
                                     our facilities.  For more information, see Security of Our Pipelines in Section 10. 
                                     The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal 
                                     agency charged by Congress to determine the probable cause of extraordinary 
                                     transportation accidents, including those that occur on interstate natural gas 
                                     pipelines.  Based on their ﬁ ndings, NTSB often recommends transportation safety

                                      Long before the ﬁ nal route is developed and steel for the ﬁ rst pipe is purchased, 
                                      continuing until long after the ﬁ nal connection is welded and the pipeline is placed 
                                      into operation, safety dominates the life cycle of all interstate natural gas pipelines. 
                                      Pipelines are inspected, then re-inspected, during manufacturing and construction 
                                      and again throughout operations to conﬁ rm and ensure their integrity.  The follow-

                                      that is standard in the interstate natural gas pipeline industry.

                 ously improving pipeline safety. 
                 We work with leading research and development organizations to plan and support 
                 their work to enhance the safety, efﬁ ciency and reliability of transmission pipelines.  
                 These organizations include: 
                  •  Common Ground Alliance (CGA) – a member-driven association 
                   dedicated to ensuring public safety, environmental protection and the 
                   integrity of all underground facilities by promoting effective dam-
                   age prevention best practices   
                  •  Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) – a re-
                   search cooperative that has been working for many decades to 
                   improve pipeline technologies  
                  •  Gas Technology Institute (GTI) – an organization that devel-
                   ops and deploys technology solutions to help promote the use of natural gas 
                   as a secure, abundant and affordable energy source to meet future needs.
                  •  Joint Industry Projects (JIP) – research projects funded by groups of pipe-
                   line companies that focus on a speciﬁ c issue 
                        •  INGAA Foundation – the research arm of INGAA that works to 
                        facilitate the efﬁ cient construction and safe, reliable operation of 
                        the North American natural gas pipeline system 
                        •  Participation and support of federal research and development

                 Security of Our Pipelines 
                 In recent years, we have strengthened our industry’s security, working closely with 
                 the TSA to coordinate these efforts. 
                 INGAA established a Security Committee, composed of industry leaders, to 
                 evaluate security best practices for both physical and cyber security threats 
                 and help develop industry guidance for implementation of these best prac-
                 tices.  The committee promotes enhancing our security programs by: 
                  •  Implementing TSA’s Pipeline Security Division guidelines that 
                   describe best practices for securing our facilities 
                  •  Participating in TSA’s crisis management drills 
                  • Attending TSA’s annual International Pipeline Security Forum 
                  • Conducting our own major crisis management drills 
                  •  Reporting suspicious incidents to the Transportation Security Operations Center 
                   (TSOC), an arm of TSA 
                  •  Sharing information through DHS’s internet-based Homeland Security Informa-
                   tion Network (HSIN) 
                                   SAFETY      Every Step of the Way
                In Conclusion
                The men and women working for the companies that build and operate North 
                America’s interstate natural gas pipeline systems have created a safe and efﬁ cient 
                mode of energy transportation.  We intend to keep it that way. 
                INGAA
                The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) is a 
                trade organization that advocates regulatory and legislative posi-
                tions for the natural gas pipeline industry in North America and 
                advocates action to improve pipeline system safety. 
                INGAA represents almost all the of the interstate natural gas transmission pipeline 
                companies operating in the United States, as well as companies in Canada and 
                Mexico.  Its members transport the vast majority of the nation’s natural gas through 
                a network of about 185,000 miles of pipelines. 
                INGAA Foundation
                The INGAA Foundation Inc. was formed in 1990 by INGAA to ad-
                vance the use of natural gas for the beneﬁ t of the consuming public 
                and the environment.  The foundation sponsors research aimed at 
                promoting natural gas use and safe, efﬁ cient pipeline construction 
                and operation.  It funds reports and studies, sponsors forums on 
                technical and economic issues that are of interest to its members, 
                and promotes natural gas infrastructure development worldwide.  
                Today, the foundation has more than 135 members representing natural gas pipe-
                line companies, construction companies, engineering ﬁ rms, pipe and compressor 
                manufacturers, law and accounting ﬁ rms, companies providing information tech-
                nology and other suppliers of goods and services to the pipeline industry.
