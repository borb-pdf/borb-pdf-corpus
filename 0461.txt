  An introduction
  to health and safety
    Health and safety in small businesses
 What you should know about – where to get more information
    It’s your business
    but we can help you look after it!
        Getting hurt at work or becoming ill through work is not a pleasant
         subject to think about. The reality is that over 200 people a year
         lose their lives at work in Britain. In addition, around 150 000
, and an estimatednon-fatal injuries are reported each year
    2 million suffer from ill health caused or made worse by work.
    The mistake is to believe that these things happen in highly unusual
    or exceptional circumstances that never occur in your workplace. This is not
        the case. Some basic thinking and acting beforehand could usually
          have prevented these things from happening.
          Implementing health and safety measures doesn’t have to be
         expensive, time consuming or complicated. In fact, safer and
    more efﬁcient working practices can often save money but,
    more importantly, they can help to save lives.
    This booklet shows you the kind of things which cause the
    more common accidents and harm to people’s health. It lets you
    see what applies to your work activities, and tells you how you can get
         more help and information.
         This is especially important if you are in charge of work activities,
         eg you are an employer, because you have legal responsibilities.
