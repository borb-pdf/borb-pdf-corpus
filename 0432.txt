                    1.     The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such
                    information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this
                    Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning
                    taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of
                    their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is
                    not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by
                    Articles 1 and 2.
                    2.     Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be

                    of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and

                    enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to
                    the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or
                    authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the
                    information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the
                    foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes
                    whensuch information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both
                    States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.

                  a)   to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and
                       administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
                  b)   to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal
                       course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

                       commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the
                       disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

               the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the
               requested information, even though that other State may not need such information
               for its own tax purposes.The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject
               to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to
               permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no
               domesticinterest in such information.
               5.    In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a
               Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is
               held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a
               fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

               1.    The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of
               revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent
               authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of
               application of this Article.
               2.    The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in
               respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting
               States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation
               thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the

                  assistance be restricted, e.g. to countries that have similar tax systems or tax
                  administrations or as to the taxes covered. For that reason, the Article should only be
                  included in the Convention where each State concludes that, based on the factors
                  described in paragraph 1 of the Commentary on the Article, they can agree to provide
                  assistance in the collection of taxes levied by the other State.
